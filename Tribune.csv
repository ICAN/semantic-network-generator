http://homertribune.com/2014/04/test-fishing-shows-nice-herring-roe-counts-in-kodiak/<COL>Test-fishing shows nice herring roe counts in Kodiakby Laine WelchKodiak’s roe herring fishery began April 15 with little notice and rumors of fire sale prices. The fleet of 22 seiners was down a bit; they are competing for a harvest of 5,800 short tons, similar to the past five years. No gillnetters signed up for the fishery. Test fishing from the east side of the island was showing nice roe counts, said James Jackson, herring manager at ADF&G in Kodiak.“We are fishing a predominantly older age class of mostly nine year olds, and it looks like we are hitting those fish right now,” he said. “They are about 250 to 300-gram fish, with 12.5 percent roe counts, so it looks pretty good.”Female herring are valued in Japan for the amount of roe they contain as a percent of body weight. As much as 90 percent of male and female carcasses are mostly just ground up and dumped.Talk of an advance price of $150 to $200 was the word on the Kodiak docks, down by half from last year. Virtually all of Alaska’s herring roe goes to a single market, where hefty supplies reportedly remain in warehouse freezers.Meanwhile, Alaska’s largest herring fishery at Togiak is poised to take off with a harvest of nearly 28,000 tons. With the market in a slump and prices in the pits, some were calling for the fishery to remain closed.“It’s not worth going over there,” said Dillingham’s Robin Samuelson, Chair of Bristol Bay Economic Development Association and lifelong fisherman. “A lot of fishermen say we need to hold our spot in case prices comes up. I personally feel fish are more important to the ecosystem at $50-$65 a ton than catching them. We need to look at how we can capitalize on that market.”The base price for roe herring last month at Sitka Sound was $150, compared to $600 in 2013. The price last year at Togiak was about $100/ton.But things are looking up! A bill just passed by Alaska lawmakers expands the Salmon Product Development Tax Credits to include herring. Senate Bill 71, sponsored by Senator Peter Micciche (R-Soldotna), will enable processors to purchase equipment and make investments in more valuable herring products, such as canned, powdered, pickled and smoked.“There have been positive trends since this bill was originally enacted (for salmon) in 2003, including product diversity, increased state revenues from the fisheries business tax and increased permit prices,” Micciche said in a press release.The bill was also expanded to include new product development from fishery byproducts.Quality guidesAlaska’s seafood industry will soon enter into a 10-step training program designed to improve good behaviors by Alaska’s seafood processing workers as they turn fish into food.“This is such a critical point for the industry; you have no quality, you have no control,” said Brian Himelbloom, a microbiologist at the Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science Center, a part of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “There’s a lot of turnover in the seafood industry, and this is something that’s been talked about for a long time.”Armed with a $40,000 grant from Icicle Seafoods, Himelbloom and his colleagues will create 10 modules to guide a QC training program. Icicle CEO Amy Humphreys said, “the training will ensure more Alaskans are qualified for quality control jobs, and help others advance their careers.”The modules will include onboard handling and quality of the catch, principles of Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points, practical seafood sanitation, seafood processing and preservation, adding value to seafood products, seafood safety and quality, sensory analysis of seafood products, quality control programs for both whitefish and salmon and seafood byproducts utilization and management of processing wastes.The final module covers interfacing with regulatory agencies and record-keeping in the seafood industry.Fish fizzleFor the first time since 1990, the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce has called off its famous fisheries debate due to non-participation by candidates.Dan Sullivan’s campaign claims a military commitment and Joe Miller has not responded at all. All candidates received letters of invitation in mid-January to the May 23 debate, which this year coincides with the annual Kodiak Crab Festival. Mead Treadwell was the first to confirm, followed quickly by Senator Begich.“It is unfortunate that some of the candidates weren’t able to work this debate into their schedules,” said Trevor Brown, Kodiak Chamber executive director. “I can imagine they are extremely busy and must have some considerable obligations to pass up an opportunity to talk about issues that affect such a large portion of our state’s population. It is a true loss to all the fishing communities in the state.”The two-hour debate, limited to topics relevant to Alaska’s seafood industry, is broadcast live to every Alaska community via the Alaska Public Radio Network. Another fisheries debate featuring candidates for governor is set for Aug. 28 in Kodiak. All candidates have already confirmed their participation.Fish WatchOcean Beauty Seafoods was awarded the 2014 Supplier of the Year award by Whole Foods Markets for consistently providing the grocer with Alaska salmon and halibut.Whole Foods said Ocean Beauty’s fish products meet its strict specifications, and that it “admires Ocean Beauty’s partnering with port buyers to ensure fishermen are recognized and treated with respect.”<COL>Test-fishing shows nice herring roe counts in Kodiak<COL>2014-04-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/09/report-shows-economic-effects-on-alaska-seafood-industry/<COL>Report shows economic effects on Alaska seafood industryBy Laine WelchWant to know the average fish prices at the docks over a decade; or where most Alaska fishermen and fishing fleets call home? What about how Alaska’s seafood industry stacks up against other state industries?What is likely the most comprehensive, user-friendly report ever completed on Alaska’s seafood industry by region was just released by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.Titled “Economic Value of the Alaska Seafood Industry,” the report was compiled by the Juneau-based McDowell Group and includes all direct and indirect economic effects of the industry for Alaska, Washington and the nation.Here are some highlights: The seafood industry directly employed more than 63,000 people in Alaska in 2011; meaning 1-in-8 workers earned at least part of their annual income from seafood. The industry accounted for nine percent of all private-sector resident earnings.Alaska residents account for 58 percent of the commercial fishing workforce in Alaska. The other 42 percent come from all over the U.S. and other countries.The Alaska seafood industry created an estimated 34,500 jobs and nearly $2 billion in labor income for Washington residents in 2011. In fact, Alaska fisheries directly employ more Washington residents and generate more direct labor income than Washington’s fishing or logging industries.Nationwide, the Alaska seafood industry puts 94,000 people to work. For every Alaska fisherman, processor, or direct support worker, an additional 1.24 U.S. jobs were created by the Alaska seafood industry.Alaska accounted for 56 percent of the total U.S. commercial catches and 36 percent of total U.S. ex-vessel value (at the docks) in 2011.Although Alaska produces 95 percent of all salmon caught in the U.S., it represents only about 23 percent of the total U.S. salmon supply. Nearly 80 percent of all U.S. seafood is imported.Salmon is Alaska’s most valuable species, worth 31 percent of the total dockside value in 2011. Alaska pollock is by far the largest fishery by volume, and the second most valuable. Halibut and black cod combined make up the third most valuable species, followed by crab, Pacific cod and flatfish.Alaska’s commercial fishing fleet included 32,000 fishermen on roughly 8,600 fishing boats in 2011.About two-thirds of all Alaska seafood is exported; seafood from Alaska accounts for 58 percent of all U.S. seafood exports ($3.2 billion in 2011).Salmon accounted for 75 percent of Southeast Alaska’s total wholesale value in 2011. The seafood industry accounted for 18 percent of all labor income earned in that region.Kodiak’s seafood industry provided about 56 percent of total employment. Kodiak is generally regarded as having the most diverse collection of fisheries in the state.The Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region accounted for 73 percent of Alaska’s commercial seafood harvest by volume, and 37 percent of direct employment. Alaska pollock, the largest fishery in the country, accounts for more than half of the region’s wholesale value. It is the only Alaska region where salmon does not figure prominently in the species makeup.Bristol Bay’s seafood industry relies primarily on the world’s largest sockeye salmon run. The commercial seafood industry accounts for 45 percent all labor income earned within the region.For the Southcentral region, salmon accounted for 78 percent of the  total wholesale value. The region produced $430 million worth of seafood in 2011.The Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region is home to 42,534 residents and produced $19.8 million worth of seafood, (first wholesale), in 2011. Salmon caught by setnet fishermen and a king crab fishery in Norton Sound account for most of the region’s commercial seafood harvest.The three largest seafood processing companies in Alaska are Trident Seafoods, Icicle Seafoods and Ocean Beauty Seafoods.Compared to mining, for example, direct employment in Alaska’s seafood industry averages 30,900 workers per month, with labor income valued at $2.1 million; mining employs 4,100 workers totaling $565,000.In terms of fish prices at the docks, Alaska pollock averaged 17 cents a pound in 2012; Pacific cod averaged 27 cents. There were big drops in prices for halibut at $4.19 a pound (compared to $4.97 in 2011), black cod at $3.53 ($5.13 in 2011), and crab averaged $2.46 ($3.64 in 2011).Prices for herring increased from 11 cents last year to 26 cents a pound. The average salmon price of 92 cents was a nine-cent increase from 2011. Across the board, the total average dock price for fishermen in 2012 dropped four cents to 35 cents a pound.The ASMI report concludes that seafood is Alaska’s ultimate renewable resource which can provide economic benefits for centuries. Find the report at www.alaskaseafood.org.Farmed fish fanfareThe farmed salmon industry is coming on strong with big plans to polish its image. Only 25 percent of consumers believe farmed fish is the same quality as wild fish, according to a major study by the London-based Mintel Group.The National Fisheries Institute’s Salmon Council, which formed earlier this year to promote all wild, farmed, domestic and imported salmon products, is touting a $60,000 study on salmon consumption in the United States.Council chairman Rick Speed of Icicle Seafoods said the study gives a “clear and targeted picture of how to effectively market salmon in the U.S.,” and that the industry will seek a “one voice” approach. (Anyone joining the Salmon Council by the end of September will get a peek at the report findings).Inaugural members of the Salmon Council include: Icicle Seafoods, Inland Seafood, King and Prince Seafood Corp., Marine Harvest USA, Mazzetta Company, Morey’s Seafood, The Norwegian Seafood Council and Seattle Fish Company.Also newly launched this summer is the Global Salmon Initiative, comprising 15 salmon farmers who provide 70 percent of the world’s production. The group pledges that 100 percent of its products will be certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council by 2020, and will measurably reduce impacts of fish farms on ecologically important regions.The GSI also touts the development of “vegetarian fishmeal” to reduce the amounts of wild fish that are caught and ground into fish feeds. Scientists at the University of Maryland replaced fishmeal with a blend of plant protein sources, with no difference in the growth rate of the fish.The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization predicts global aquaculture production will grow 33 percent by 2021, while wild production will grow just three percent.Salmon watchAlaska’s total salmon catch was nearing 261 million fish by Aug. 30. Of that 210 million were pink salmon, which is almost 78 percent over the forecast.<COL>Report shows economic effects on Alaska seafood industry<COL>2013-09-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2012/06/cranes-return-to-previous-years-territory-down-to-the-specific-yard/<COL>Cranes return to previous year’s territory, down to the specific yardAll About CranesBy Kachemak Crane WatchHow large are crane territories?  Why do they form territories?  Do crane territories overlap?Cranes flying over Inspiration Ridge, by Nina FaustTerritorial sizes vary, and pairs have been known to nest within 300 meters (981 feet) of each other.  In some cases, cranes’ breeding territories overlap.  No information is available on territory sizes in Homer.  However, for Greater Sandhill Cranes in Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho, five territories ranged from 25 – 57.5 acres, and averaged 42.5 acres.  At Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, territory size depends on the number of nesting pairs and ranged from 3-170 acres, and averaged 62.5 acres.Sandhill Crane use calls to defend their territories.  They will also aggressively chase off other cranes within their territories.  The male is the prime nest defender.How many eggs do cranes lay and how long before they hatch?  Who incubates the eggs?Homer’s Lesser Sandhill Crane population generally arrives in mid to late April.  Cranes may begin laying their eggs around the first week of May.  Many nesting pairs were reported to be on the nest by May 9, with some pairs not laying eggs until the end of May.  In the Arctic, Sandhill Cranes may not lay their eggs until late May or early June.  Generally, two eggs are laid.  Eggs, which are oval-shaped, and brown with reddish spots, take roughly 30 days to hatch.  Crane pairs raise one brood per year.Both cranes share incubation.  Sometimes both are at the nest for fairly long periods of time.  Each adult takes a turn incubating the egg while the other goes off to forage.  They may forage fairly close to the nest, or they may go quite a distance away.  Some cranes go a mile or more away to feed, and upon returning to the nest, usually call to their mate while still in the air 1/4 mile away or more.  Cranes paint their feathers with iron laden mud to maintain camouflage, so if a paint hole is not close, they may have to fly off to the nearest one.  Generally, the off duty adult stays nearby so it can return if there is a problem at the nest.When the chicks (called colts) hatch, they are covered in a soft golden down.  They can walk and leave the nest within 24 hours of birth.  The parents’ brood (sitting on) the chicks to protect them and keep them warm for up to three weeks.  The adults also feed the young.Sandhill Crane Viewing EtiquetteRespect private property.Rather than approaching cranes, use binoculars or spotting scopes to observe them.When possible, use your car as a “blind” by staying in or near the vehicle.Keep pets leashed.Teach children good viewing etiquette by keeping them with you.Never bother cranes on a nest or at their nighttime roost.Cranes are protected migratory birds. It is illegal to harass them, except during hunting season.If you have a Sandhill Crane question, email it to reports@cranewatch.org.<COL>Cranes return to previous year’s territory, down to the specific yard<COL>2012-06-20<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/12/expect-a-smaller-pacific-halibut-harvest/<COL>Expect a smaller Pacific halibut harvestby Laine WelchNext year will be no exception to the five year trend of trimming   Pacific halibut catches. There’s a lot of halibut out there, but the fish are growing so slowly it is keeping a downward press on the amount of fish being made available for harvest.  Fisheries for the Pacific coast, British Columbia and Alaska could be cut by 19 percent next year if managers accept the recommendations of fishery scientists.The International Pacific Halibut Commission released preliminary numbers last week that show a combined catch of 41 million pounds for fisheries on the Pacific coast, British Columbia and Alaska. Of that, 32.5 million pounds is allocated to Alaska fishermen, down from 40 million pounds of halibut this year.The reductions would be especially brutal again for Southeast Alaska where halibut catch limits have dropped by more than 60% over the past five years.  For 2011, a whopping 47 percent cut is being proposed for the Panhandle to just 2.3 million pounds.For Alaska’s biggest halibut hole, the Central Gulf, next year’s catch could be slashed by 28 percent to 14.3 million pounds.  The recommended catch for the Western Gulf   is 7.5 million pounds, down 24 percent.  Smaller fisheries along the Aleutians could see slight increases to 4.6 million pounds; likewise; Bering Sea fishermen would get a slight bump to 3.7 million pounds of halibut.The reduced supply of halibut will have a serious market impact, said analyst John Sackton of Seafood.com.“Already halibut prices are the highest in over 10 years with dressed fish wholesaling for over $7 in Seattle. The lower landings already have buyers bidding up prices and that will be a bigger problem next year.  Halibut is a very popular food service fish on a lot of menus and it is not easy for many restaurants to change course,” he said.Sackton cautioned that total removals of sport and commercially caught halibut have been running 9-14% per year above recommended levels.“The fish are growing so slowly that the scientists are asking the halibut commission to consider a management strategy to reduce catches even further given the current biological situation. It’s not good news.”The IPHC will make final decisions on 2011 halibut catches at its annual meeting January 25-29 in Vancouver. The Pacific halibut fishery opens in March.Fish earmarks – Both of Alaska’s senators voted against a proposed three year moratorium on earmarks, saying the state has needs that are best served by those funds.An earmark is anything requested by a member of Congress that has not been included within the president’s budget, explained Senator Lisa Murkowski in a phone call from Washington, D.C.“It is so important to understand that so much of what we include in legislation are initiatives that have been requested by  states that the administration doesn’t even know about, and there are many competing interests,” she added.“I don’t view construction of a harbor as pork or abusive wasteful spending,” Murkowski said, using a $750,000 appropriations request for dredging at Kodiak harbor as an example.“That is an earmark because it is not included in the president’s budget. It is something I have requested be inserted in the energy and waters appropriation bill because it is a priority for Kodiak.”A good chunk of earmark money funds fishery research grants in Alaska. A $400,000 earmark funds the annual crab stock assessments in the  Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. No assessments, no fishery.  Another $500,000 bankrolls research for Alaska seals and Steller sea lions.Murkowski called the recent push by Congress to ban all earmarks “long on bravado but short on substance.”“When we’re talking about how we can make meaningful reductions in our level of spending and our deficit, we’d better be looking at something that comprises more than just one percent of our federal budget.”Fish funds from Uncle Ted – A left over pool of federal money obtained by the late Senator Ted Stevens was awarded recently to four diverse fishery projects. The Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, administrator for the funds, put out a call for proposals in September for projects targeting fish co-products, energy use and salmon education.Four projects split the $100,000 payload, said AFDF director Jim Browning.The fishermen-run Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association  will target an outreach campaign towards educating legislators about the economic importance of commercial salmon fishing to the state.Sand Point-based Aleutia, will use its funds to buy ice totes and chill monitoring equipment, and build its regional salmon branding program.Browning said the City and Borough of Juneau intends to take the first step towards creating  a fishermen’s direct marketing center.“Juneau has talked about this for some time and they will use theis money to begin  planning for a facility  where all the direct marketers can work out of and have signage and everything else,” Browning said.The final recipient, the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce, will use its funds to create new and traditional media to promote Kodiak’s local seafood that is produced using renewable energy.“Kodiak will highlight its three new wind turbines in a ‘sustainable renewable’ promotional campaign,” Browning said.The Kodiak Chamber of Commerce received $20,000 in matching funds from the Kodiak borough. The Kodiak campaign is being developed by Seattle-based Waterfront Associates.<COL>Expect a smaller Pacific halibut harvest<COL>2010-12-08<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/06/investing-beyond-short-term-cds/<COL>Investing beyond short-term CDsby Edward JonesMatthew NorthFinancial AdvisorMany people depend on certificates of deposit (CDs) to provide extra income. Yet CD rates have been fairly low for a while. In recent months, in fact, one-year CDs were paying about 0.5 percent, two-year CDs topped out at around 1%, and five-year CDs paid in the 2 percent to 2. 3 percent range. Those rates are scanty enough, but they can seem even lower in an economic environment marked by rising food and gas prices.Before you consider alternatives, keep in mind that CDs still offer a key advantage:  safety of principal. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation typically insures CDs up to $250,000. And since CDs are relatively short-term in nature, you don’t have to worry about locking away that money for long periods of time. So there can be a place for CDs in the fixed-income portion of your portfolio.However, during times such as these, you might consider looking at additional options, keeping in mind that, when seeking greater income, you’ll likely be taking on more risk. Let’s consider a few alternatives:Fixed annuities — Many people buy fixed annuities to supplement their retirement income. But most annuities also allow you to take up to 10 percent of your account value each year without penalty. Plus, the interest rate you receive on a fixed annuity may be more competitive than that currently paid by a CD. Keep in mind, though, that annuities are not backed by FDIC insurance, and any guarantees are backed solely by the paying ability of the insurance company. Additionally, early or excessive withdrawals may be subject to penalties. If you believe a fixed annuity might be appropriate for your situation, speak with your financial advisor.Bond ladders — If appropriate for your situation, you can potentially gain extra income through a strategy known as a bond “ladder.” To build a ladder, you buy several bonds with varying maturities — short-, intermediate- and long-term. Once you’ve constructed your ladder, you could gain some advantage in various interest rate environments. When market rates are low, you’ll still have your longer-term bonds earning higher interest rates. And when market rates rise, you can reinvest your maturing short-term bonds at the higher rates. But if you need income in addition to your regular interest payments, you can get it from the maturing bonds. Unlike CDs, however, bonds are not covered by FDIC insurance and are subject to credit risks. Bonds are also subject to interest rate risk: When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and you may lose some or all of your principal if you sell your bond prior to maturity. But by holding your bonds until maturity, you can avoid loss of principal, assuming the issuer doesn’t default.Dividend-paying stocks — Some companies have paid — and increased — their stock dividends for many years now. If you don’t need the dividends to boost your cash flow, you can reinvest them to help boost your ownership stake. However, companies can reduce or discontinue their dividends at any time, and since stock prices fluctuate, you risk losing some or all of your principal.By exploring alternatives to short-term CDs, you may find other appropriate investments that may better position you to reach your financial goals — so look around to see what’s available in the financial marketplace.This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor.<COL>Investing beyond short-term CDs<COL>2011-06-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/09/scientists-see-increase-in-sea-crab-population/<COL>Scientists see increase in sea crab populationby Laine WelchAlaska’s conservative management, combined with the grace of Mother Nature, is swelling the abundance of two of the state’s largest and most important fisheries.Bering Sea crab scientists and stakeholders met last week to discuss the outlook for Alaska’s biggest crab fisheries that open Oct. 15. The take away was that the stocks of red king crab, bairdi Tanners and snow crab all showed big increases in mature size classes, based on data from the annual summer surveys. (Only mature male crabs cans be retained in Alaska’s crab fisheries.)That has industry watchers predicting little, if any, change to the crab catches, said market expert John Sackton. The data did show some peculiarities though: there are indications that a spike in water temperature (by 2 degrees Celsius) might have redistributed the crabs into survey areas as they moved in search of colder waters. That could discount stock increases, Sackton said.Raw data showed an increase in the red king crab biomass from 34,000 tons to nearly 48,000 tons; well above the five-year average, and mature females also increased. For snow crab, mature males increased from 58,000 tons to more than 105,000 tons, Sackton said, and the level of male recruits increased 40 percent to more than 140,000 tons.Crab catch quotas for the 2013/14 season were 8.6 million pounds for Bristol Bay red king crab, 1.6 million for Tanners and 54 million pounds for snow crab. The Bering Sea crab fisheries are jointly managed by the state and federal government, and catch quotas are set by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.Similarly, Alaska’s pollock stocks may be at the highest level since 1982. Even better, trawl and acoustic surveys also showed several big-year classes coming into the pollock fishery, said Dr. Jim Ianelli, NOAA’s chief pollock scientist. The Alaska pollock fishery accounts for 70 percent of the total Bering Sea harvest, and is the nation’s largest fishery.However, the robust stock won’t translate into a higher catches. The fishery is managed under a 2 million ton cap; last year’s quota was 1.3 million tons, equaling nearly 3 billion pounds.Fake fish fracasA group of 90 scientists and biotechnology execs from around the world is pushing President Obama to expedite final approval of genetically modified salmon for U.S. markets. They urged in a letter last week that the Food and Drug Administration put an end to the long wait for final approval of laboratory produced salmon made by Aqua Bounty Technologies. The company has been trying 20 years for FDA approval of what would be the first animal given the OK for human consumption. Scientists argue that the genetic techniques used in salmon are no different than that used in the hundreds of millions of acres of GMO crops planted each year.Frankenfish backers said the Aqua Bounty salmon has met or exceeded all federal requirements and reviews. More than 1.5 million people wrote in opposition to the genetically tweaked salmon, and 65 supermarkets have said they won’t carry it.Senator Mark Begich was the first to pounce on the prospect of “test tube” fish in a retaliatory letter.“These East Coast scientists should learn a lesson from Dr. Frankenstein; just because you create something in a lab doesn’t mean it is safe for the public. Claims that GMO salmon are safe are simply not true,” said BegichStudies have shown that GMO salmon, which can grow three times faster than normal salmon, can breed with wild fish. Begich said escapees could decimate Alaska’s wild salmon stocks negligence, just as GMO wheat has been found growing in the wild—a development we were assured could never happen.”“You can’t put the genetics genie back in the bottle, and that’s why I will keep fighting to make sure GMO salmon are never approved by the FDA,” he added.Senators Begich and Murkowski co-sponsored legislation to stop FDA approval, and to require labeling if Frankenfish is approved. Senator Murkowski has questioned if it can even be called a real fish.“This takes a transgenic Atlantic salmon egg, which has genes from an ocean pout, somewhat akin to an eel, and it combines with the genes of a Chinook salmon,” she has testified to Congress. “I have questioned time and time again, why would we want to be messing with Mother Nature like this? We are trying to invent a species that would grow quicker to out compete with our wild stocks. This experiment puts at risk the health of our fisheries not only in Alaska, but throughout the Pacific Northwest.”Fish trendsNew packaging, new flavors and easy-to-prepare meals made a big splash last week at the New Product Showcase at Seafood Expo in Barcelona, Spain.SeafoodSource reports that a product called “Sum Boxes” by Vivos Y Perecederos is self-assembled, recyclable and waterproof. Compared to expanded polystyrene seafood boxes, the Sum Boxes costs 30 to 40 percent less.Fish Snack’s by Savia Nature are crispy salmon and cod skins of in different flavors. Seafood burgers, sausages, brochettes and meatballs made of salmon, tuna, bonito and swordfish were presented by the company Josmares. Cream cheese with caviar also drew rave reviews.Fish on!Congressional candidates will face off over fish issues at a debate from 7-9 p.m. on Oct. 1 in Kodiak. Sen. Begich and opponent Dan Sullivan will take center stage during the first hour, followed by Rep. Don Young and challenger Forrest Dunbar.The fisheries debate, hosted by the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce, will be broadcast live over Alaska Public Radio Network stations, and live streamed via KMXT/Kodiak. NHK Japan Broadcasting plans to record the event.

The answer can be summed up in two words: sockeye salmon.Bristol Bay is home to the largest red salmon runs in the world, and sockeye is Alaska’s most valuable salmon fishery by far. In most years, well over one-third of Alaska’s total earnings from salmon fishing stem from Bristol Bay.Whereas other fishing regions like Copper River, Cook Inlet, Kodiak, Southeast and the Alaska Peninsula might get sockeye catches ranging from 1 to 5 million fish, Bristol Bay’s harvests can reach into the 20 to 40 million range. “The Bay” also has the most salmon fishermen with more than 2,800 active permit holders.Fishermen were expecting to catch about 17 million reds at Bristol Bay this summer, but it could blow past that number by the time you read this. Catches were already topping 2 million a day, and by July 4, the harvest was at 14 million. And another surge of sockeyes is on the way.  Salmon trackers predict the run of sockeyes homing in to Bristol Bay could top 38 million; 45 percent over the preseason forecast.Alaska’s statewide sockeye catch this summer is pegged at nearly 34 million, a 14 percent increase over 2013. The total salmon catch this year is projected at 133 million fish, down 47 percent from last year’s record haul. (Summed up in two words: pink salmon.)Alaska fish test cleanRamped up testing this summer shows Alaska fish is free of all signs of radiation from the Fukushima nuclear meltdown following Japan’s horrific earthquake and resulting tsunami three years ago.“The results of the testing of Alaska fish that were just collected look very good,” said state veterinarian Bob Gerlach last week.? “There is no detection of any radiation that would have originated from Fukushima. That was very good news.”From the beginning, state and federal agencies have partnered to test and track Alaska seafood for radiation. Concerns over contaminants that showed up recently in salmon and tuna caught off the Pacific coast prompted more Alaska-specific testing prior to salmon season.“The state has worked with the State Department of Health and DEC to develop a sampling plan to select certain species of fish from the Aleutian islands and Bristol Bay, as well as the Gulf of Alaska and Southeast,” Gerlach told KDLG. “We will be collecting additional samples through the summer from other species of fish to try and get background information. But at this point, we haven’t been able to detect anything at all; all the samples have come up as ‘non-detects’.”Oceanographers predicted that Fukushima radiation was expected to hit Alaska waters this year.“Because fish come in at different time periods, we were collecting as early as possible when the salmon fishery started, and will continue to the end of the season,” Gerlach added.Scallop’s status quoThere’s been no stampede to Alaska’s scallop beds in the newly opened fishery to all-comers. The fishery has been managed under a limited entry system for years, but was changed to “open access” starting July 1.“To date, we haven’t had anyone register or obtain an observer to fish in that fishery, so we anticipate the same four vessels that have historically fished the last four to five years to be the only vessels that will fish during this scallop season,” said Mark Stichert, fishery manager at ADF&G in Kodiak.Weathervane scallop beds dot Alaska’s waters from one end to the other, yielding a stable total harvest each year of around 400,000 pounds of shucked meats.“Historically, the two largest beds are Yakutat and here in Kodiak,” Stichert said. “Some fishing has occurred inside Prince William Sound and up in Cook Inlet, but those two areas are both closed this season due to low abundance. We have scallop fishing occurring in the Alaska Peninsula, a small fishery in Dutch Harbor, and a fairly sizeable harvest in the Bering Sea.”Managers are also re-opening an old scallop bed along the Alaska Peninsula that has been closed for five years to allow the stocks to regenerate.Fishermen’s prices for scallops can be at or above $10 a pound, making the fishery worth $4 million at the Alaska docks.Comments wantedFederal fishery managers want comments on plans to relax Steller sea lion protections and allow more fishing for cod and Atka mackerel along the western Aleutian Islands. It could lead to those fisheries being reopened in January after a five-year closure. Deadline to comment is Aug. 15. www.regulations.gov<COL>Bristol Bay sockeyes rule Alaska salmon fisheries<COL>2014-07-08<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/11/whitefish-surpasses-shrimp-in-u-s-consumption/<COL>Whitefish surpasses shrimp in U.S. consumptionBy Laine WelchAmericans remained true to their seafood favorites last year with shrimp, canned tuna and salmon topping the list of the 10 most popular seafoods. That’s according to the National Fisheries Institute, which compiles the list each year based on data from the government’s Fisheries Report.Following those top three are tilapia, Alaska pollock, Pangasius, crab, cod, catfish and clams.A closer look at the numbers shows that, for the first time in five years, crab consumption began to increase again after a steady decline since 2007. Perhaps the biggest trend revealed in the top 10 list is whitefish surpassing shrimp as the largest single seafood category, said market expert John Sackton. Whitefish consists of cod, pollock, tilapia, Pangasius and domestic catfish.Combined consumption of those fish soared 6.2 percent, while shrimp fell 9.5 percent.As a result, whitefish — as a category — is now higher than shrimp in terms of U.S. per capita consumption. The growth in whitefish is driven by farmed tilapia and Pangasius. Cod saw a small increase, while pollock and domestic catfish declined.Also declining, Americans ate slightly less seafood overall last year at 14.6 pounds per person, compared to 15 pounds in 2011. One bright note: Each person ate just over two pounds of salmon, a 3.5 percent increase.Tilapia tattleAccording to the USDA, Americans eat close to 500 million pounds of farmed tilapia a year. That’s more than four times the amount they ate a decade ago. Some 80 percent of the bland-tasting fish comes from China, with Thailand also exporting significant tonnage to the U.S.What most Americans don’t know is that farmed tilapia from these countries are given large amounts of antibiotics to ward off infections from manure, which is used as a cheap alternative to fish feed.According to the Center for Food Safety, it is a common practice to use untreated chicken manure as the primary nutrition. In some farms, coops are placed over the water and the chickens poop directly into the fish ponds.Similarly, an October article in Bloomberg’s titled, “Asian seafood raised on pig feces approved for U.S. consumers,” reported that 27 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S. comes from China, yet the FDA only inspects 2.7 percent of the imports. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to follow the advice of the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program and consider the source of tilapia before buying it. Tilapia raised in the US., Canada and Ecuador all get passing grades, while those from China and Taiwan are “iffy alternatives.”Pangasius is a better pick. This whitefish is a type of Asian catfish, and is usually seen on supermarket shelves as basa. Roughly 90 percent of the fish is farmed in Viet Nam, and is the most monitored of all farmed fish, according to SeafoodSource.Keepin’ it cleanMarine debris clean-up projects across Alaska are wrapping up for the year. One of the largest programs, operated by the Alaska Marine Stewardship Foundation, estimates removals at 160,000 to 200,000 pounds this year from projects around the state.“It seems that wherever we look, there is a great deal of marine debris to be found” said Dave Gaudet, AMSF director, adding that it is becoming more difficult to recycle the debris.“Once it is collected, we like to get the debris out of the community because many of the landfills in rural Alaska cannot handle the additional material,” Gaudet explained. “And some simply don’t want debris they had no part in creating to remain in their community.”AMSF had been working with a recycler in Washington State for many years, but they are not currently accepting shipments due to poor markets for the materials. Gaudet said AMSF is conducting a pilot project with another recycling nonprofit this fall.“Hopefully, this will provide a long term solution to the problem of disposing of plastic marine debris,” he said.Reports of debris arriving from the March 2011 Japanese tsunami decreased this season. However, at one cleanup at Cape Suckling, the contractor reported a large influx of debris following the storms the week of Oct. 21. He reported that a large amount of what appeared to be household items with Japanese writing on them appeared on the beach that just been cleared of approximately 55,000 pounds of marine debris.All kinds of debris from the Japan tsunami will continue to arrive on Alaska’s shores for years to come, and experts predict 2014 will be the year that deep water, current driven debris really starts hitting US shores.

The current moratorium, which affects 8,500 Alaska vessels, was set to expire on Dec.18.The regulation is aimed at preventing fuels, toxins or hazardous wastes from entering the water. That makes sense, said Senator Lisa Murkowski, but needing permits for hosing down a boat is going overboard – especially when recreational boats, even 300 foot yachts, are exempt from the rule.The discharge exemption is part of the U.S. Coast Guard Act, which also was reauthorized this week with a unanimous and bipartisan vote by Congress.“It’s very exciting to get this bill done,” said Senator Mark Begich.  “It’s something we’ve worked on for some time and seeing it done is good news for Alaska and this country.”As chair of the Fisheries, Oceans, Atmosphere and Coast Guard committee for four years, it’s the second USCG Act Begich has authored and been passed unanimously during his tenure.Among other things, the USCG acquisitions FY2015 budget represents a nearly $1 billion increase to modernize the fleet and strengthen its capabilities. It also includes permanent funding and inflation adjustment for the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Committee, which oversees oil/gas projects and development in that region.So who will fill the seat of Fisheries and Oceans committee chair now that Begich is heading home to Alaska?“That’s a great question,” he said. “It won’t be an Alaskan and it will be a great challenge for us. Senator-elect Sullivan does not have the seniority and Senator Murkowski is not on the committee. So Alaska will not have the authority that it used to have.”What will Begich miss most about being in Washington? Working on behalf of individual Alaskans, he said.“Things like helping with social security needs or a veteran’s disability issue or fishermen and federal bureaucracy,” Begich said. “We had more 300,000 inquiries on individual issues we dealt with every day. I’ll miss that. The job of a senator is not only to represent issues on a national level, but to never forget where you’re from.”Trident invests in the RockTrident Seafoods is now a triple owner of fish plants in Kodiak with its purchase last of Western Alaska Fisheries from Maruha Nichiro/Japan.Trident has long operated the large Star of Kodiak processing plant, which is mostly housed in a moored World War II Liberty ship. Last year, Trident bought the small Alaska Fresh Seafoods plant located next door. That property will expand Trident’s frozen holdings, said CEO Joe Bundrant.“We’re building a new freezer facility there, and the fish we used to tender out of the Gulf of Alaska to our Akutan plant will now be processed in Kodiak,” Bondurant said. “Also, when you get your big pink salmon runs in places like Prince William Sound, we’ll be able to tender salmon here, as well as handle any large seasons of pinks that come into Kodiak.”The new freezer plant will mean more jobs for Kodiak’s resident workforce, said Trident plant manager Paul Lumsden.“We’re anticipating a minimum of 50 per shift,” Lumsden said, adding that the facility will be operating by next June or July.Bundant said Trident’s takeover of Western Alaska Fisheries begins Jan. 1.“We’re excited to operate that plant and we’ll operate business as usual starting in January,” he said. “All qualified employees will be offered a job with Trident.”Trident Seafoods was launched by Chuck Bundrant in 1973. It is now the largest “source to table” seafood company in the nation. Son Joe said one constant is that Trident “is all about its people.”“Trident runs our business for our stakeholders,” Joe said. “My dad has never paid a dividend to the shareholders, it’s all gone back into the business. They are one of the stakeholders – we take equally serious the other stakeholders, and that is the communities and certainly our fishermen. That’s our employees and our customers.”Bundrant said investing in Kodiak holds special meaning for him.“I was born here, my parents lived on Island Lake when I was young,” he mused. “To be able to make this investment in Kodiak is something special.”Trident operates in 10 Alaska communities including the world’s largest crab processing plant at St. Paul and the nation’s largest seafood processing plant at Akutan.Trident also has five research and development facilities, three in the Lower 48, one in China and one in Japan, “to help add value to every pound of fish,” Bundrant said.The company has three project divisions that make/market pet treats and supplements made from fish meals and oils under the Alaska Naturals brand; another focuses on human nutrition, and a third produces fertilizer.“Full utilization is our goal. We are constantly trying to find new homes and new markets for Alaska seafood,” Joe explained. “That commitment and effort is how we really return more to the fishermen. And I challenge anyone to show me another processor that is more committed and done more for innovation.”“We are totally committed to the State of Alaska,” said Chuck Bundrant with a strong handshake as he went out my door.The story of Trident Seafoods and Chuck Bundrant – who literally began his career in the hold of a crab boat – parallels the development of Alaska’s seafood industry. Read it in “Catching a Deckload of Dreams” by John Van Amerongen.Cargo gets cleanerA new approach to an old idea could pioneer a cleaner planet. A small Seattle-based company called Pacific Sky Power aims to design a new style of cargo ship that cuts air pollution. Experts estimate that the 10,000 or so cargo ships that cover the globe each year produce 20 million tons of greenhouse gases each year.“The end goal of the project is to have a fleet of sail-powered cargo vessels operating in the Pacific Ocean, traveling from the west coast to Hawaii, then to Asia and back over to Alaska,” said project leader Don Tracy.Pacific Sky Power has come up with a “Transformers” kind of wide stance ship design that can extend and retract its size.“We’re looking at a catamaran configuration that uses a folding cross member and a telescoping mast to collapse at port, so it can efficiently manage the containers to onload and offload without an issue,” Tracy explained.The Sky Power team is designing and conducting trials on two fully operational prototypes of a 300-foot ship carrying more than 200 containers.Sky Power also is raising funds to keep the project afloat via Kickstarter, a web”based “crowd funding” community that — according to its website — ‘brings creative ideas to life.” Since its launch in 2009, Kickstarter claims more than 7 million people in 214 countries have pledged $1 billion to fund 71,000 projects.Tracy said early funding provides fine tuning and feasibility data before seeking out other backers.“A big part of the project is coming up with all the mechanics that will allow us to fold the ships up and redeploy the sail and give the ship a wide stance at sea,” Tracy said. “It’s a big engineering challenge and it has to be worked out on a small scale first. Then we will be able to work with naval engineers to design the full size ships.”<COL>Fishermen can hose down boats, no problem<COL>2014-12-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/02/salmon-forecast-decreased/<COL>Salmon forecast decreasedBy Laine WelchAlaska’s 2010 salmon season will produce 15 percent fewer fish, if predictions by state fishery managers hold true.The statewide, all-species harvest is pegged at 138 million salmon, compared to last year’s catch of 162.5 million salmon. It is the 12th largest take since 1960.According to the “2010 Run Forecasts and Harvest Projections Report” just released by the state commercial fisheries division, the shortfall stems from an expected decrease in pink salmon catches.The statewide breakdown for this year’s projected salmon catches calls for a slight bump up for Chinook to 515,000 fish; for sockeye, a catch of 45.8 million reds is an increase of 2.5 million; the coho catch of 4.4 million is up just slightly; staying the same is the chum forecast of 18 million fish. For those hard-to-predict pinks, a projected catch of 69.1 million is about 28 percent lower than last year.Here is a sampler of regional information included in the 2009 salmon season overview:In Southeast Alaska, 1,915 permit holders participated in the fisheries — up 2 percent from the previous year. Chum salmon was the most valuable species, valued at $37 million at the Southeast docks.At Norton Sound, 88 permits were fished. It was the second-highest since 1997, but the 12th-lowest on record. The fishery value of $722,000 was well above the 5-year average of $428,000 and the third-highest in 20 years.Sixty-two salmon fishermen were out on the water at Kotzebue, the most since 2001. The average value for each permit-holder was $6,073.At Kodiak, of the 608 eligible permit holders, only 291 (48 percent) made landings, up slightly. A fleet of 158 seiners accounted for 93 percent of the salmon landed, and averaged $185,000 per permit fished. The average earning for 132 Kodiak setnetters was $48,000 per permit, above the 10 year average of $38,000.Find the 2010 Alaska salmon catch projections and a wrap up of the 2009 season at www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/Give it up!Lent began last week, a time of fasting and soul searching for hundreds of millions of Christians around the world. The word Lent derives from the Old English lencten, meaning spring. The 40-day Lenten season, which this year runs from February 17 to Easter Sunday on April 4, dates back to the fourth century.Traditionally, the faithful give up eating meat during Lent — and what the holiday sales season from Thanksgiving to Christmas means to retailers, Lent means to the seafood industry. Food Services of America, one of the nation’s largest distributors, reports that Ash Wednesday (the start of Lent) is the busiest day of the year for frozen seafood sales. The six weeks following is the top-selling season for the entire year.While nearly all seafood enjoys a surge of interest during Lent, the most traditional items served are the so-called “whitefish” species, such as cod, pollock, flounder and halibut. But no matter what the seafood favorite, the six-week Lenten season is good news for Alaska, which provides more than 60 percent of all the nation’s wild-caught seafood to U.S. restaurants and grocery stores.Copper kills fish smellsA study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists says even legal amounts of copper can harm salmon. The scientists presented the study at this month’s Alaska Forum on the Environment in Anchorage.The scientists conducted the study in Washington state, where there is concern about copper in road runoff and storm drains. The researchers said the tiniest traces of copper can block a salmon’s ability to smell — and a strong sense of smell is the difference between life and death for a fish.“When dissolved copper gets into the water, it affects their ability to smell odors,” said Dr. Tracy Collier at NOAA’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.? “That ability is really important for them to avoid predators, find other salmon for mating and to point to home.”All things Alaska seafoodAlaska seafood is making a splash on Facebook.

The communities of Naknek, Dillingham, Petersburg and Cordova received funding via the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for two years to jump start net recycling projects. The pool of money comes from the US Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which has committed $2 million to the ‘Fishing for Energy’ program over the next five years.“The goal is to find an alternative use for these mountains of web that otherwise go in our landfills,” said Kristin Smith, director of the Copper River Watershed Project, one of many  recycling project partners in Cordova.Each community is in the process of hiring a net recycling coordinator, whose first task will be to set up convenient net drop off areas near local harbors. The old fishing nets will be barged to a salvage company in Washington where they are converted to pelletized plastics and sold to Asian markets.An attempt to recycle nets in Cordova in 1991 tanked due to the high shipping costs, but the town is getting an assist this go around.“Alaska Marine Lines has agreed to contribute shipping and they are a key to the whole process,” Smith said. “Because the economics are not there right not – there was a time when they would pay 12 cents a pound for old web, now it’s 4 cents.”“Fishing for Energy” projects began two years ago in New England fishing ports. In just one year, more than 80,000 pounds of old nets, buoys, pots and other derelict gear was collected and converted into energy.  That pales in comparison to the port of Dutch Harbor, for example, which has roughly 10,000 tons of old nets in its landfill now, and it accumulates by another 1,000 tons each year.Get this – energy experts say that just one ton of old fishing nets converts into enough electricity to power one home for 25 days!­Meanwhile, as Alaska’s recycling projects ramp up, Cordovans have already put old fishing nets to good use. The Watershed Project uses them to help surface a scenic 1,100 foot trail on the Cordova breakwater that is made up of big boulders, called riprap.  Instead of paying for costly shot rock, the group got the idea to use gillnet web.“We have a big pile of gillnet web and we hack it into pieces and stuff it down inside the big riprap and fill in the bottom part of the trail. Then we can put 12 inch rock on top of that, and then gravel is used for the final walking surface,” Smith said, adding that Cordova also uses old nets at its ski hill.“In the summer it’s just a pile of nets, but in the winter when it’s covered with snow, it helps forms a ramp that people can ski off of. You don’t have to buy fill or do a lot of earth-moving to make that kind of a ramp.”Tell me a story – Social scientists are gathering oral histories across the US as a way to preserve the culture of America’s fishing communities. Fishermen, processors, boat builders, businesses, managers, scientists – anyone with a fishing story can contribute.A handbook called “Voices from the Fisheries” offers tips on gathering oral histories, said Susan Abbott-Jamieson, a NOAA social scientist and co-author of the handbook for audio, video or written interviews.   (www.voices.noaa.gov)“It starts from the beginning of a project and tells you how to get started,   how to get people in the community involved, there is a section for teachers about how to include it in their curricula, legal and ethical issues about interviews, and information on on recording technologies and web site resources,”  Abbott-Jamieson told KMXT/Kodiak.When the oral histories are completed, they can be uploaded to a NOAA database that serves as a repository for America’s fishing stories. Currently, there are only two oral histories from Alaska on the database, from women in Kodiak and Cordova who talk about working in the male dominated fishing industry.“We want to encourage people and organizations and schools to interview people in the fishing industry, especially those who have memories of 40 or 50 years ago, and contribute their stories so they can be available to anyone in the world,” Abbott-Jamieson said.Superstitions wanted – Fishermen are notorious for being superstitious – now a popular magazine wants to feature their stories.“I’ve been exploring the general psychology of superstitions and  why people believe strange things,” said Matt Hutson, a science writer for Psychology Today magazine. “What’s fascinating is that even people who are skeptical, like myself, will still do certain rituals or avoid certain taboos or say things that might prevent bad luck.”Hutson said research shows that in unpredictable and dangerous situations, such as fishing, people use superstitions as a way of finding some control over their environment.“When they don’t have any real control, they try and rely on certain habits. In the fishing industry there is a lot of unpredictability and it’s an incredibly dangerous job. When people are under stress, or facing danger, that also increases their reliance on superstition,” Hutson said in a phone interview from New York City.The strangest superstition he has heard so far is a taboo against bananas on board, likely due to deadly spiders hiding in the bunches. Hutson said he will use fishermen’s stories in Psychology Today’s magazine and website, and perhaps in a book.“I’m trying to dig up good stories – maybe someone who left port on a Friday believing that it would not bring bad luck,  and a bunch of strange things started happening so he changed his mind about that one,” he explained.Contact Matt Hutson at (212) 260-7210 x 207 or via at matt@psychologytoday.com .Big boat on display – A new maritime history exhibit called On the Water opened this weekend at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. It features a model of the largest U.S. fishing vessel, the 376 foot catcher processor Alaska Ocean. The four foot cut away shows a cross-section of the wheelhouse, factory decks, crew staterooms, galley and cold storage hold. A video produced by the History Channel also shows the vessel in operation.The Alaska Ocean, which carries a crew of 125 and participates in the Bering Sea pollock fishery, is owned by Glacier Fish Company and the Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation, representing 15 western Alaska coastal communities. Along with catching and processing fish, the state-of-the-art vessel also is equipped to make fish meal from inedible portions, and to produce fish oil to create heat and power for the big boat. The Alaska Ocean, model was donated to the Smithsonian by the At-Sea Processors Association.

Brutal winter weather wreaked havoc on deliveries the final week, and bumped up prices as buyers scrambled for the last fresh fish of the year.The season opened in late March with lots of expensive halibut holdovers from last year in U.S. freezers. That pushed dock prices down by roughly a dollar per pound all season.Final prices at Kodiak were reported at $3.40 – $4.30 per pound for fish weighing from 10 pounds to “40 ups.”  Kodiak prices dipped as low as $2.50 at the docks this summer.At Homer, final halibut prices to fishermen ranged from $4 – $4.35 per pound. Homer easily held on to the title of America’s no. 1 halibut port with more than 12 million pounds, 23 percent of all landings, crossing those docks. Kodiak was a distant second at 7.6 million pounds, followed by Seward, Dutch Harbor, Juneau and Petersburg.The demand this year came from retail buyers, as more customers avoid expensive restaurants and buy halibut to eat at home, said market analyst Ken Talley. The frozen market also has taken off, and inventory holdings “are said to be very low,” he added.Customers appreciated this year’s lower prices, said Dannon Southall, wholesale/retail manager at 10th and M Seafoods in Anchorage.“It’s definitely down –last year we were running halibut fillets at $13-14.95 at retail and this  year we had it as low as $10,” Southall said, adding that sales were steady all season.“There is still lots excitement around Alaska halibut,” he said. “We are definitely getting more questions about omega 3s and the different health benefits from halibut and all the fish we carry.”In all, Alaska longliners landed 42 million pounds of halibut during the eight month fishery, or 97 percent of the catch limit. Lots of small fish were being landed again this year, said Duff Hoyt, manger at Icicle Seafoods in Homer.“The halibut growth rates are much slower,” Hoyt said, “probably due to competition for food with all the arrowtooth flounders that are blanketing the bottom of the Gulf.”Pups upThe latest surveys show a bump up in the number of Steller sea lion pups throughout the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea.“Between the last survey in 2005 and what these results show from this summer is a 10 percent increase overall in pup production for the western segment of the population throughout the range. The only region still showing a slight downward trend is far west of Adak. A 2008 survey also showed either a “stable or increasing trend” for juvenile and adult sea lions throughout most of the westward range.Even though the numbers are growing, it is a very slow increase, cautioned Doug DeMaster, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Juneau.The westward stock of sea lions was listed as an endangered species in the 1990s because their numbers have declined dramatically since the 1980s.  No one is sure why – it could stem from climate changes or predation by killer whales, and although scientists have concluded that commercial fishing is likely not the culprit, sea lion protective measures starting in 1999 have shut down or shuffled traditional fishing grounds and seasons ever since.The question now is whether the fishing restrictions are helping the sea lions rebuild their numbers fast enough. According to federal guidelines, population increases over 15 years “would reflect sustained growth for two generations during two environmental regimes, and provide assurance the sea lions are recovering.”Fishery managers are crafting a new opinion on the effects of commercial fishing on the sea lions and their habitat.  Benton believes the steady upward tick in overall numbers bodes well for the industry.“With these trends, we’re hoping that the National Marine Fisheries Service is going to make a determination that additional restrictions are not necessary for commercial fisheries,” Benton said.The draft biological opinion will be out for public comment in March.<COL>Alaska longliners land 42 million pounds of halibut<COL>2009-11-25<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/06/making-our-fishing-communities-sustainable/<COL>Making our fishing communities sustainableby Laine Welch–What are the biggest opportunities and challenges facing Alaska’s seafood industry? Jobs, adding value and high-energy costs were common themes given by five major candidates for governor during the famed fisheries debate at Kodiak.Here’s a sampler of the candidates’ responses:“We need to put more jobs in the hands of more Alaskans. That is the biggest opportunity,” said Senator Hollis French. “That should be our objective; to make sure our children and the Alaskans who want to get jobs can get them on the boats, with the processors, on the beaches, wherever the jobs are.”“The biggest hurdle is to prevent our fish from being caught and processed by individuals who don’t have a stake in our state, who don’t have an economic interest in our communities,” French added. “What you want is a strong waterfront community where individuals who want to live and work here have that opportunity. So the opportunity is to provide jobs for Alaskans, and the hurdle is outside ownership.” For Ralph Samuels, the biggest opportunity is to manage the fishery resource so it continues to grow.“We can’t start fighting over how we allocate between gear types, between communities and user groups. We have one of the best managed fisheries on the planet, and we need to make sure we keep basing decisions on science and not on politics,” Samuels said.?The high costs of energy and transportation are the biggest hurdles to the industry, Samuels said.“When you get out to Kodiak and along the Peninsula and down the Aleutian chain, you have all these associated costs to ship fish and personnel that some of your competition around the world don’t have,” Samuels added. “Those are the hurdles we have to address through policy in deciding what the role of government should be.”Adding more value to fishery products “in every way we can” is Bill Walker’s vision for the seafood industry.“In Alaska, because of the cost of energy, we send out fish that is partially processed and other countries finish the processing of our resource. That’s wrong,” Walker said. “An economy is when you have value added in your state. A colony is when you send out the resource and have someone else add value to it. Adding value also could create jobs in rural Alaska.”Walker agreed the biggest obstacle for the seafood industry is the cost of energy.“Twenty percent of the cost for fish processors is the cost of energy,” he said. “We have to get the cost of energy down.”Gov. Sean Parnell said the No. 1 priority is maintaining a sustainable resource, and he agreed that “value-added” provides the greatest opportunity for the industry.“When it comes to the greatest threat, I have to say it is the federal government,” Parnell said. “If the new administration is going to overlay marine spatial planning, if they are going to come out with a biological opinion on Steller sea lions that is adverse to our interests, that is where we are going to have to put up our hands as Alaskans and say no more. But until we have the willingness to step up against the feds when they step over the line, that is our greatest threat.”For candidate Ethan Berkowitz, his vision for the fishing industry is one “where you have more Alaskans on the decks of their own boats, where we are processing more fish and adding more value in state, and we are more in charge of our fisheries future.”“We see some significant challenges with how catch shares are implemented and how we allocate fish,” Berkowitz said. “We need to make sure our fishing communities are sustainable, and that crews have an opportunity to work their way up in the industry. Fisheries are ultimately about fish and about people.”Fish quality report cardsBristol Bay salmon fishermen will get report cards this summer that grade them on the quality of the fish they deliver to processors. The project is an expansion of a trial undertaken last year in Egegik by Mark Buckley of Kodiak, a former Bay fisherman and owner/operator of Digital Observer, Inc.“Every time a fisherman delivers in his district, 20 of his fish are pulled off at random and tagged and put into the fish-hold,” Buckley explained to fishermen at a meeting in Naknek. “They go down the line and get graded by people in the plant. If they see a tagged fish go by, they grab the tag and put it in a coffee can. For the number 2 and 3 lines, they do the same thing.”All of the tags are then tallied according to each fishing boat and the information is entered into a spreadsheet. The objective is to develop a profile of each fisherman’s percentage of No. 1 fish delivered throughout the season.The results of the quality grading system with 15 Egegik boats last year was a real eye opener, Buckley said.“Forty-one percent of the fish the fleet delivered were No. 1, 52 percent were No. 2 and 17 percent were No. 3. That means that six out of every 10 fish were less than No. 1 quality by the time they got to the plant,” he told KDLG.At the end of the season, Egegik participants got their fish quality report cards that also showed an average monetary value of the fish from each boat’s deliveries. At wholesale, the price difference between a No. 1 and a No.3 fish can be more than $1 per pound. Despite the variability in fish quality, the project revealed at the end of the season, all boats were paid the same price per pound and all got the same bonuses for chilling their fish. That has led Buckley to propose a change in the way fishermen are compensated.“Everybody would get the same grounds price at the end of the season. Then in the spring, after the company has sold the fish and knows how much it is going to split up among everybody for post-season adjustments, some guys would be paid a little bit more than others,” Buckley explained. “It doesn’t cost the company any more, but they will start to compensate for quality. Everybody gets a bonus, but some guys get more because of the quality of their fish.”Buckley said the continuous quality improvement will result in a better bottom line for Bristol Bay fishermen, and attract more processors to the region.“Fishermen are realizing they are getting paid for fish poundage, not quality,” Buckley said. “I want to see quality rewarded and bring this fishery back to those nice healthy profit margins we saw in the 1980s.”This summer, salmon boats in all major Bristol Bay fishing districts, except Togiak, will use the fish quality report cards. The project is funded by the fishermen-operated Regional Seafood Development Association, the state university and federal funds.<COL>Making our fishing communities sustainable<COL>2010-06-23<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/02/companies-to-test-new-products-at-symphony-of-seafood/<COL>Companies to test new products at Symphony of Seafoodby Laine WelchEleven new seafood products from seven companies are set to showcase their ideas at the upcoming Symphony of Seafood gala in Seattle and Anchorage.In its 21 years, the event has introduced and promoted hundreds of new Alaska seafood items to the marketplace.“Developing new products is really hard,” said Julie Decker, new executive director of event host Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. (Decker replaces a retired Jim Browning). “It costs a lot of money, takes a lot of time and attention, and sometimes the products are wonderful and sometimes they are not. So this event really helps companies determine how the marketplace is going to receive their product.”Entries come from major Alaska seafood companies, as well as small “mom and pops.” This year, they include beer-battered cod, a ready-to-eat grilled pollock fillet, all-natural Keta Salmon Jerky and Little Sammies in a blanket made with salmon franks.On Feb. 5, an expert panel in Seattle will judge all of the products in three categories: retail, food service and smoked. Winners will be kept secret and announced after a tasting bash at the Anchorage Hilton on Feb. 13. All top entries, as well as a grand prize winner selected by voters, receive a trip and booth space at the International Boston Seafood Show in March.Last year’s Grand Prize went to Zesty Grill Sockeye Salmon by Copper River Seafoods. The 2012 big winner was Kylee’s Alaska Salmon Bacon by Tustumena Smokehouse in Soldotna.New life for old fisherySmall-boat fishermen will have a chance to drop dredges for Weathervane scallops this summer. Starting July 1, state waters of Yakutat, Prince William Sound, Shelikof Strait and Dutch Harbor will be open to any vessel that registers for the fishery before April 1.Only four or five boats have targeted Alaska scallops since the fishery went to limited entry 15 years ago; that was after waves of East Coast boats boosted the number to more than 20.The boats today are usually 70-80 feet, but 58-footers also have participated, said Wayne Donaldson, state regional shellfish manager at Kodiak. The total Alaska catch is usually half-a-million pounds of shucked meats.“You need a boat that has enough horsepower to pull a scallop dredge along the bottom, and you need enough deck space to haul up the dredge and sort out the scallops,” Donaldson said. “So we will see how small the boats are that decide to jump into it.”Donaldson added that, “Since it is all new, we encourage anybody who is thinking of getting into the scallop fishery to give us a call or stop by so we can go over how the regulations are structured.”USA StrongSeafood is, by far, Alaska’s top export, and a strong U.S. dollar means it will cost more for global customers to buy it.“The dollar is really strengthening against a basket of other currencies because the U.S. economy is doing better than many other places,” said market expert John Sackton of Seafood.com. “So it makes imports of things like farmed shrimp, salmon or tilapia less expensive for the U.S. to buy, and makes exports from the U.S. more expensive in the host currency, whether it’s Yen or Euro, Canadian or Yuan or whatever.”Each year between 60-70 percent of Alaska’s seafood is exported to other countries, and a strengthening dollar will make it slightly harder for Alaska to be competitive, Sackton predicted.“But I would think of it more as a headwind,” he added, “rather than a change in direction.”Aqua-AwardsNOAA Sea Grant plans to award a total of $3 million to fund a national competition for marine aquaculture research projects. It is part of the “overall plan to support the development of environmentally and economically sustainable ocean, coastal or Great Lakes aquaculture,” according to the grant website.Institutions of higher education, nonprofit and commercial organizations, state, local and Indian tribal governments and individuals are eligible.  Topical priorities for the FY2014 include research to inform about pending regulatory decisions, informational outreach tools, social and/or economic research to understand aquaculture issues and impacts in a larger context.Pre-proposals must be received via email to the National Sea Grant Office by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Feb. 21, 2014. www.grants.gov<COL>Companies to test new products at Symphony of Seafood<COL>2014-02-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/03/pretty-in-%e2%80%98pinks%e2%80%99/<COL>Pretty in ‘pinks’A bumper run of pinks could provide a 20 percent boost to Alaska’s total salmon catch this year to 175 million fish. If the forecast holds true, Alaska’s salmon harvest this year will be the 11th largest since statehood.State fishery managers have released the 2009 salmon run forecasts and catch projections for all Alaska regions. Here’s a breakdown by species:   for Chinook salmon, the total catch is pegged at 249,000, a decrease of 85,000 fish from last year. The statewide sockeye catch is projected at 38 million, a drop of one million reds from last season. The preseason projection for coho salmon call for a slight increase to 4.6 million silvers; likewise, chums should see a slight bump to 18.5 million fish.For those hard-to-predict humpies, state managers estimate the catch will jump to 113 million pink salmon, a 34 percent increase from last year.The state report also gives a great recap of the 2008 salmon season by region. Some interesting highlights: The salmon catch at Southeast Alaska and Yakutat regions totaled 28 million fish, with a dockside value of $117 million. Landings were made by 1,853 permit holders, a slight decrease.At Copper River, the 2008 sockeye salmon catch of 321,000 was the lowest in 30 years.The near record 42.4 million pink salmon catch at Prince William Sound was made up of 97 percent hatchery raised fish.Lower Cook Inlet had the lowest salmon catch in a decade, but increased prices pushed up the value to $3.96 million. That ranks as the highest value since 1988, and the fourth highest since statehood.Salmon catches in the Kuskokwim region by 462 permit holders totaled 494,108 fish, an increase of 50,000.A total of 496 permits fished salmon on the Yukon  River last year. The average fishing income for the Upper  Yukon was $2,633; for the Lower Yukon, income averaged $1,479.Norton Sound enjoyed the third largest coho salmon harvest on record and a resurgence of pink salmon fishing. The combined harvest of all salmon species was the best in ten years.  The 2008 fishery was valued at $760,362, the highest since 1994. The average fishing income value for Kotzebue fishermen was $8,026.At Kodiak, only 277 out of 608 permit holders landed salmon last year. The value of the Kodiak catch increased by $3.5 million to $27.87 million. Fifty-four salmon permit holders fished at Chignik, where the dockside value of $7.3 million equates to about $234,000 in fishing income per permit holder.The value of Alaska’s 2008 salmon fishery was $409 million at the docks.Find the 2009 salmon catch projections at www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/Halibut beginsThe halibut season begins on March 21 this year, and the fish will face a tough market. The fish landed during the first week is likely to see inflated prices as high-end users feature the season’s first fresh halibut on their menus and at seafood counters. But once the initial excitement dies down, the country’s economic crunch will bite into prices.There’s still a few million pounds of halibut in the freezers, according to Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley.  And it’s expensive fish. Alaska processors last year paid $4.31/lb on average for halibut last year, up just one penny from 2007, but a 16 percent increase from 2006.  At the time when prices were at their highest last year, topping $5/lb at major ports, the U.S. economy shut down. The fresh market, which drives halibut, ground to a halt as consumers looked for cheaper fish. That left seafood companies holding lots of expensive fish in the face of nose diving demand.  Talley said processors hope to make up for the losses they’ve suffered in trying to move pricey halibut hold-overs out of the freezers. Alaska’s halibut catch limit this year is 45.5 million pounds, down from 50 million last year. Approximately 2,400 longliners will participate in the Alaska halibut fishery, which  runs through mid-November.Fish picksTen Alaskans have applied for one seat on the state Board of Fisheries. The Fish Board oversees management of commercial, sport, personal use and subsistence fisheries in state waters. A seat that begins July 1 is held now by Karl Johnstone, a retired Anchorage judge and sport fishermen tapped to replace Jeremiah Campbell, who quit the Board in December. Johnstone has yet to be confirmed by the legislature.Incumbent Bonnie Williams, an angler from Fairbanks, hopes to land another three year term. According to the weekly Laws for the Sea by Bob Tkacz, many hopefuls are vying for Williams’ seat. They include:  Anchorage sport fishermen Robin Childs and Bob Churchill, who is a former subsistence advisor for United Fishermen of Alaska. Also, Dianne Dubuc form Seward, a charter operator and former commercial troller from Seward; setnetter Brent Johnson of Clam Gulch is head of the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association; Bob Heinrichs is a commercial and subsistence fisherman from Cordova; Michael Huston of Eagle River is vice president of Totem Equipment and Supply and a former Alaska heavy weight boxing champion; Nancy Morris Lyon of King Salmon co-owns and operates Katmai Fishing Adventures; and Stanley Malcom of Petersburg is President of the local Charter Boat Association. The final Board hopeful is Brandii O’Reagan of Nikiski who gave no information other than a Kenai post office box, Tkacz said.Governor Palin has until April 1 to make her selection for the Fish Board seat, which is subject to legislative approval.<COL>Pretty in ‘pinks’<COL>2009-03-25<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/12/forecasting-the-future/<COL>Forecasting the futureIt’s tough to make business plans when the economy is being buffeted by forces beyond your control. And most forecasters predict the rough ride will last at least through the rest of the coming year.Here are some outlooks for the prospects and challenges facing important Alaska seafoods provided by longtime analyst Ken Talley, editor of Seafood Trend:Wild salmon supplies will increase, especially for the lower-priced species, less so for the high end products. The big task for marketers will be to keep prices from sliding.Farmed salmon will be less available, due in great part to financial troubles and disease problems that continue to plague the Chilean industry. Production there could fall 25%-40% after the upcoming coho and steelhead harvests. This could mean reduced exports to the U.S. market, especially if buyers are unwilling to pay higher prices. Farmed Atlantic salmon from Norway and Canada will fill some of the void.Groundfish supplies will be down for some important volume leaders, notably, Alaska pollock harvests which will decrease from 1.2 million tons to 815,000 tons. Demand could remain so strong that producers could move away from surimi production to pricier fillets. As for cod, Talley said “the problems in this cash-intensive business have more to do with the inability to finance production and inventory than any problem with demand.”Halibut will remain at the top of the fresh market, but frozen halibut will see lower prices even with a lower catch limit, which is expected to drop about 10.6 percent in 2009. This should keep fresh prices at high levels as it moves away from retail and further towards white tablecloth restaurants.“While halibut is not as affected by overseas markets as groundfish because it is predominantly a domestic product, there will be a decreased demand for higher priced fish,”speculated John Whiddon, general manager at Kodiak’s Island Seafoods.  “White table cloth restaurants do not and cannot absorb all the halibut, in fact, much of it is sold to large distributors, restaurant chains and club stores.  These markets will most likely be very sensitive to higher priced products, so I would expect the market price to reflect the shift to more moderate valued seafood options.”At retail, Ken Talley said seafood prices have increased more than any other protein. The higher prices for all proteins will push down consumption next year, even as retail sales gather steam as consumers cook more at home. Seafood Trend predicts a 1.4 percent drop in U.S. per capita consumption for 2008.Another challenge for seafood at retail is that most Americans simply don’t buy much fish and shellfish. According to the Food Marketing Institute, less then 40 percent of U.S. shoppers buy seafood, whether fresh or frozen, more than one a month. Only 4 percent shop for fish and shellfish once a week. Most disturbing of all, 32 percent of shoppers never even look at fresh fish.The frozen seafood case may help save the day. According to Nielsen retail tracking data, frozen seafood is becoming more popular at the local grocery store.“And we’re not just talking breaded fish sticks,” Talley said. “Sales of unbreaded frozen fish are soaring.”Frozen unbreaded seafood gained 13.5 percent in a recent 52-week period to almost $335 million. The five most popular frozen fish are tilapia, with dollar sales up 16.8 percent, salmon up 22.5 percent, flounder up 10 percent, cod up 11.2 percent, and catfish up 32 percent. Talley credits the renewed acceptance of frozen fish to the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute’s ‘cook it frozen’ campaign and consumers’ desire for more affordable fish.Roughly 48 percent of consumers are eating out less frequently, and 59 percent have stopped buying expensive cuts of meat, which could spell trouble for high-priced seafood.At the same time, consumers are still interested in eating healthier foods. Nearly 75 percent of surveyed adults try to eat healthier fare when they dine out. This leaves a nice opening for seafood, one of the healthier choices on a menu.Most disheartening for seafood lovers, the Producer Price Index shows overall cost of fish and shellfish has jumped 7.6 percent, far more than food inflation overall.  Fresh products gained only 6.2 percent; processed seafood jumped 9.4 percent thanks to the 14 percent increase in canned prices, and frozen seafood prices increased 6 percent. Meanwhile, beef costs have gained 6 percent, poultry saw prices gain 5.6 percent, and pork prices increased 5.2 percent.Import volume of seafood showed only a 1.4 percent drop in volume through October. However, that resulted in a 5.1 percent increase in prices.  Export volume declined even more, with shipments down 7.2 percent. That, in turn, resulted in a 9.3 percent increase in prices.Mass o’ flatsWhat’s the biggest bulk of fish in the Gulf? Arrowtooth flounder, which are often mistaken for 10 pound halibut.Since the early 70’s mass of arrowtooth has increased seven fold in the Gulf of Alaska and they are now the most abundant groundfish in the sea. That carpet of flatfish can out-eat all the foods shared by many other species. Fishery scientists believe the flounders are responsible for the slow growth experienced by Gulf halibut.At current levels, scientists claim fishermen could catch a half billion pounds of arrowtooth flounder. But far less is caught in Alaska each year, fetching pennies at the docks. The problem is that there has been little buying interest in arrowtooth flounders because their flesh contains an enzyme that turns it to mush when it is cooked. But scientists have found ways to neutralize the enzyme. Also, if the fish are chilled to near zero or processed immediately and frozen, the enzyme does not break down the flesh.<COL>Forecasting the future<COL>2008-12-31<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/01/halibut-quotas-to-be-determined/<COL>Halibut quotas to be determinedHalibut managers and industry stakeholders meet next week in Vancouver, B.C. to decide on catch limits for this year’s upcoming fishery, which usually begins in early March. Harvesters are bracing for a 10 percent coast-wide reduction to 54 million pounds, covering fishing grounds from the West Coast and British Columbia to the farthest reaches Bering Sea.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the halibut catch and will get 46 million pounds of the fish, if the International Pacific Halibut Commission goes along with the scientists’ recommendations. That’s down from 50 million pounds last year. Southeast Alaska fishermen would see the biggest hit – a catch of just 4.5 million pounds is a drop of nearly 30 percent for the second year in a row.The IPHC will also consider several new management proposals – one requests the continued use of electric or electric assisted sport fishing reels to benefit older or disabled anglers, especially in deeper waters. It says not doing so discriminates against people with physical limitations.Two proposals ask for clarifications of filleting sport caught halibut at sea. Another asks that qualified harvesters be allowed to retain halibut taken in pots along with sablefish in area of the Bering Sea. Pots are frequently used by fishermen instead of hook and line gear to prevent killer whales from stealing the sablefish, but current rules demand that all halibut taken as bycatch in the pots must be discarded. The halibut can’t be safely returned to the sea, the proposal states, because the whales gather to quickly gobble them up. Other proposals ask that size limits for halibut be eliminated, and for the state of Alaska to develop a harvest tag program for all recreational anglers to get more accurate counts of their catches.The IPHC meets January 13-16 in Vancouver. Get more information at www.iphc.washington.edu.Slow start for snow crabThe Bering Sea snow crab fishery officially opens in mid-October but it doesn’t really get going until mid-January. Low cod prices were expected to prompt more boats to target snow crab during the early weeks of the season. But encroaching sea ice is getting things off to a slow start all ‘round, said state fishery manager Forrest Bowers in Dutch Harbor.<COL>Halibut quotas to be determined<COL>2009-01-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/03/deckhands-get-their-day/<COL>Deckhands get their dayAlaskans are being asked to help shape a new program aimed at tracking the economic importance of deckhands to the fishing industry.Best “guess-timates” peg the number of Alaska deckhands at 20,000. As self-employed workers, no wage reports are collected by the state, and crews have fallen through the cracks when it comes to labor data showing their financial contributions to coastal communities. Each must buy a fishing license, but it doesn’t tell if or when they fish, in what fisheries, or for how long.  The data is important for several reasons, said Geron Bruce, assistant director of the state commercial fisheries division.“First, you can’t really estimate the total economic impact of commercial fishing unless you know something about the earnings and employment patterns for the crew members who are such an important part of the work force. And we don’t have any of that information.”The lack of data also means the “boots on deck” have been on the losing end of new management plans that dole out shares of the catch.Lawmakers last year OK’d a one-time appropriation of $150,000 for commfish staff to jump start a crew labor data project.  Bruce also credited the feds for funding that is keeping the project afloat.“This is a cooperative project that would not be moving forward if we did not have the federal government as a partner in providing funding,” he said.State and federal agency reps met in January and developed five options to be presented to an industry advisory panel that is now being formed.“The biggest challenge is how to collect the data,” Bruce said. “Do you collect it at the time of landing? If so, how do you collect it? Does the crewmember report it or the skipper … do you put it on a fish ticket or have a separate system to enter the information? Those are examples of some of the options.”Another challenge is gathering 10 to 15 industry advisors who can represent fisheries in all Alaska regions, from small skiffs to large at-sea processors.“We’re interested in permit holders, boat owners, crewmembers, processors and communities,” Bruce said. “We’re going to be most interested in people who are representing groups of people or organized interests so that the input they provide will reflect a larger perspective. And in turn, they will be able to disseminate information to their group and continue to be a conduit for information.”“I am especially interested in CDQ groups as several of them have processing plants, offshore fishing vessels and also buy from local fishermen. So they can represent multiple interests,” he added.Bruce said there also is a need to expand awareness beyond Kodiak, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands regions, where the push for the project began.The first stakeholders meeting will take place in April and the preferred option for the data collection will be chosen by this winter.Interested?  Contact Geron Bruce at (907) 465-6151 (geron.bruce@alaska.gov); or Jan Conitz at (907) 465-4125 (jan.conitz@alaska.gov) .Alaska seafood scoresThe menu is still the most important factor affecting dining decisions when Americans go out to eat – and 77 percent say the Alaska brand makes them more likely to select seafood.That’s according to a national study by the San Francisco-based Hale Group, a leading consulting firm specializing in food and agribusiness industries. The study, contracted by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, reports on perceptions and preferences at fast food and casual dining chains. It includes consumer’s top concerns with seafood, how often they eat it and what kinds they want to see on menus.The study shows there is increased awareness of the impacts food choices have on the environment and on our health. Seventy-six percent of respondents said they care about the source of the seafood they choose, and that it is sustainable. Other findings: 59 percent said they eat seafood more often at restaurants than they did two years ago; 76 percent said they prefer wild, ocean caught seafood because it tastes better; only 10 percent prefer farm-raised fish.Eighty-one percent believe Alaska seafood comes from icy, clean waters; 84 percent said they would like more seafood choices at fast food restaurants; especially in salads. A “fried fish” sandwich attracted 32 percent of diners; add the term “Alaska pollock” on the menu and it jumped to 68 percent. Seventy-two percent prefer “Wild Alaska” over “organic” in describing salmon.Find the complete results of the ‘Menu Alaska’ report at the ASMI website under food service (www.alaskaseafood.org ).Fish fablesSt. Patrick’s Day on March 17 falls in the middle of Lent, a time of strict fasting and restraint for Irish and other Christians. But the old bans on boozing or eating meat don’t apply on St. Paddy’s Day. In fact, since the 11th century, meat has been eaten during Lent in honor of the patron saint. It’s called “St. Patrick’s Fish” – but it’s really roast pork. Legend has it that Patrick had tucked away a piece of pork during Lent in case he couldn’t resist the temptation, but he was soon filled with remorse. An angel appeared, telling him to throw the roast pork into the river, where – you guessed it – the meat was transformed into many fishes. Seventeen centuries later, St. Patrick’s Fish is still eaten in Ireland on this day.<COL>Deckhands get their day<COL>2009-03-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/01/accounting-for-deckhands/<COL>Accounting for  DeckhandsA project aimed at compiling labor data on Alaska’s fishing crews is gaining traction as a mix of state and federal agencies get down to business this week.It’s estimated that about 20,000 crew members work out on Alaska’s fishing grounds throughout each year, but as self-employed workers, no wage reports are collected by the state. The lack of job data means deckhands have fallen through the cracks in terms of recognizing their economic importance to the fishing industry.“All we know is that someone buys a crew license. We don’t know if they fish, what they fish for, how many fisheries they participate in, for how long – any of that kind of stuff,” said Geron Bruce, deputy director of the state commercial fisheries division.“You can’t really estimate the total economic impact of commercial fishing unless you know something about the earnings and employment patterns for the crew members, who are such an important part of the work force,” he added.“It makes it difficult for both harvesters and communities to apply for economic assistance or benefit from other state and federal programs,” echoed Mike Catsi, director of the Southwest Alaska Municipal League. SWAMC has championed the crew counting effort and helped get a $150,000 appropriation from the legislature last year to jump start the project.  The federal government, which co-manages several of Alaska’s largest fisheries, is also providing funding.The lack of deckhand data results in an incomplete picture of how commercial fishing compares to other industries. It also means fishermen have been on the losing end of new management plans that dole out shares of the catch.“Individual crew members want to be able to document their participation in certain fisheries so that if future rationalization programs come along, they have a better basis to make their case,” Bruce said. “They will be able to show that they are also dependent on these fisheries and should get some share of the quota, that their interests need to be considered more than they have been in the past.”“I think it’s a great idea. This is a legitimate job,” said Tyler O’Brien, a Kodiak fisherman. “But a lot of guys won’t want to provide any information because they don’t want a paper trail for the IRS,” he cautioned,Deckhand Isaac Milligan agreed. “All the fish passes through our hands. We need to be given credit for our contributions, even if some fishermen don’t want to be counted,” he said.The crew data could be collected via fish tickets or electronic landing reports already in place. Bruce said the next step is to form an advisory committee of up to 15 industry stakeholders that represents a good cross section of Alaska fisheries, from small skiffs on the Yukon to big Bering Sea crab boats.<COL>Accounting for  Deckhands<COL>2009-01-21<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/01/fishing-jobs-add-up/<COL>Fishing jobs add upCommercial fishing in Alaska remains a vibrant industry that each year provides more than half our nation’s wild caught seafood.  Alaska’s fishery resources are the envy of other countries around the world, and its management programs are regarded as a model for sustainability.  The seafood industry also provides more jobs than the oil/gas, mining, agriculture, forestry and tourism industries combined.Here is a sampler of some seafood industry highlights from 2008, in no particular order or priority, followed by my annual picks and pans of fish stories.High fuel prices that topped $5 per gallon idled 20 percent of Kodiak’s trawl fleet, along with hundreds of local seafood workers. Salmon boats stayed out between fishing openers, hurting coastal economies.A petition starting at Petersburg gathered thousands of fishing signatures asking Congress for a tax break from high fuel prices, to no avail.New data from the state Department of Labor revealed the average age of Alaska commercial fishermen was 47; nearly 40 percent were non-residents.Every month 7,260 fishermen were out on the water plying their trade. That number jumps to 20,137 per month at the peak of salmon season. Add in processing, transportation, management and support services, it adds up to at least 54,000 jobs a month.Nearly half of the state’s fishery biologists continued to drift away due to retirement – or lured by federal paychecks ranging from 35 percent to 80 percent higher.The University of Alaska added a bachelor of arts in fisheries to its line up, the fourth in its fisheries degree programs. Nearly 40 percent of university graduates go to work for Fish and Game or federal agencies in Alaska.Sweet Potatoes and Wild Alaska salmon baby food was launched by Beech-Nut Corp. The baby food uses pink salmon from Ocean Beauty Seafoods.West Coast salmon fisheries were cancelled, and Chinook catches in Southeast Alaska were cut by half to just 170,000 fish.The Bush Administration opened the door for oil/gas lease sales in a nearly six million-acre “fish basket” that encompasses most of the southeastern Bering Sea and Bristol Bay. The United Fishermen of Alaska, the nation’s largest fishing trade group, declared fishing rights should also be considered as “property rights” in any lease sales.The Bush Administration also sidestepped Congress and gave the nod to the first offshore fish farms that will make use of existing oil and gas platforms. Bush also pushed for watered down environmental and endangered species protections.Fishing retained the dubious distinction as America’s most dangerous occupation, with on the job death rates 36 times greater than all other occupations. Surprisingly, the Pacific Dungeness crab fishery ranked as the deadliest catch, with 17 deaths in the past seven years. That’s 50 percent higher than Bering Sea crabbers.Bering Sea king crab base prices increased to $5 pound, up from $4.19 last year. For the 2007/08 king and Tanner crab fisheries had a landing value of $202 million. Meanwhile, disenfranchised crab crews continued efforts to obtain their rightful shares of the crab quotas.Each American ate 16.3 pounds of seafood, a figure that is expected to drop as cash strapped Americans cut back on dining out. The National Restaurant Association said Americans spent 48 percent of their food budget eating out nearly six times each week.America’s seafood favorites remained the same, with shrimp, canned tuna, pollock and tilapia the top five.Alaska’s seafood message of sustainability and food safety trumped concerns over “food miles” and “carbon footprints” among global buyers.Trendy new lunch entrees made from Alaska pollock got “kid approved” at schools in Fairbanks and Kenai. Salmon wraps by Taco Loco of Anchorage also scored big with school kids. Bristol Bay fishermen and Peter Pan Seafood expanded their salmon give-away to more schools and senior centers in Western Alaska.Halibut prices continued to hover near or above $5 pound at major ports. Early estimates peg the dockside value for halibut at $175 million, an increase of $3 million from 2007. For sablefish (black cod), the value was $69 million, up $7 million from last year.Five candidates hoping to snag Alaska’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives debated fish issues at Kodiak’s ComFish. Rep. Don Young went on to win the election.The U.S. became the first country in the world to approve foods from cloned animals. Bio-engineered Atlantic salmon can grow up to 600 times faster than normal, and are ready for market in 18 months instead of the usual three years. The FDA says since foods from cloned animals pose no significant health risks, they need not be labeled.Halibut harvesters faced reduced catches stemming from a new way of counting the fish.Scientists for the first time began assessing the stocks as a single, Pacific coast-wide unit instead of by separate regions, as they had done for 20 years. That slashed the Southeast catch limit by 27 percent, to just six million pounds. It was even tougher for the Panhandle’s halibut sport charter operators, whose bag limits were cut to one.Exxon finally started cutting checks to 32,000 oil spill plaintiffs, after a 19-year wait. The U.S. Supreme Court reduced the punitive damages award from $2.5 billion to $507 million.  Exxon is appealing interest payments of roughly $500 million – that decision will come sometime this year. Plaintiffs got a bit of a tax break thanks to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who championed a bill through Congress to allow income averaging and one time retirement contributions for those receiving Exxon payments.Alaska’s fortunes could be fueled by another kind of oil boom – omega 3 oils from salmon and other seafoods are the biggest buzz in the by-products world. Omega 3 fatty acids have become one of the most popular food additives due to a whole host of health benefits – they were added to 250 food products from eggs to orange juice, and the list is growing.Sen. Murkowski also went to bat for small fishing boats to exempt them from strict new federal water discharge rules that would have required permits for even hosing off the deck.Dutch Harbor remained the nation’s top fishing port for the nineteenth consecutive year. Kodiak held on to the no. 4 spot for seafood landings.Seven fish stocks were removed from the U.S. overfishing list, and none were added.  No fisheries in Alaska waters were on the list.Fish managers at Bristol Bay got an earful after the sockeye run arrived late and all at once, overwhelming processing capacity. Idled fishermen estimated the plug cost them three million fish, bringing the Bay harvest to a lower than projected 28 million reds.Marine debris clean up efforts in Alaska reached a milestone – one million pounds of debris was removed from coastlines since 2003 in efforts spearheaded by the Juneau-based Marine Conservation Alliance. That’s equivalent to four 747 cargo planes full of nets, plastics and other trash.Alaska pollock catches were cut nearly in half to 185,000 metric tons. The fleet was also plagued with high Chinook salmon bycatch.Alaska’s statewide salmon harvest of 146 million fish was a decrease of 31.4 percent from 2007 – still, it was the 16th largest catch since statehood in 1959. And although the value of the catch was down, it topped $400 million at the docks for the second consecutive year.The National Organic Standards Board gave the “organic” nod to wild-caught forage fish used as feeds for farmed fish and livestock. Wild-caught fish for humans did not make the   “organic” grade.Fishing groups, Alaska natives and concerned citizens joined in a lawsuit to stop discharges of pollutants into Cook Inlet. The case challenges the Environmental Protection Agency for issuing a permit that will almost triple the amount of oil and gas discharges each year.A new low interest state loan program was launched to help fishermen replace or retool their engines to boost energy efficiency.2008 Fish Picks & PansBest “fish crat:” Again – Denby Lloyd, Fish and Game commissionerBest fish voice in Congress: Sen.

That’s left a whole work force largely unaccounted for in terms of its economic input and importance.“The people who work as crew members on fishing boats are one of the only groups of laborers in Alaska that are not counted in some way by the state. It’s high time this important sector of the industry gets credit for what they do,” said Jan Conitz, director of the labor data project for the AK Dept. of Fish and Game.“All we know is that someone buys a crew members license. We don’t know if they fish, what fisheries they fish in, how many, how long – any of that kind of stuff,” said Geron Bruce, assistant director of the commercial fisheries division, who has spearheaded the project.“You can’t really estimate the total economic impact of commercial fishing unless you know something about the earnings and employment patterns for the crew members, who are such an important part of the work force. And we don’t have any of that information,” he added.The lack of data also has kept deckhands on the losing end of quota systems that dole out shares of the catch.Bruce and Conitz are among a multi-agency and industry advisory team working over the past two years to develop a labor data collection system for deckhands. The program got seed money from a onetime $150,000 appropriation by the 2008 Alaska legislature.Basically, the crew data input would tie into existing state fish ticket or e-landing systems, and/or skippers might be required to keep a crew log.  The new reporting would be mandatory for deckhands in all Alaska commercial fisheries.Conitz admits some fishermen are skittish about providing more data to the government, but she said most agree the accounting is necessary. A big driver is the trend towards IFQs.“A lot of the smaller fishing towns are really concerned about the jobs and opportunities leaving their communities,” Conitz said. “It’s getting to where a young person would have a really tough time entering the industry, and having any hope  of working up to where they could be the owner of a boat.”Shawn Dochtermann, a Kodiak fisherman and industry panel member, agreed that the deckhand data is important.“If you want to protect your livelihood and be part of any privatization program, it’s your responsibility to be counted,” Dochtermann said.The agency and industry team will meet in December to finalize its recommendations to the Alaska legislature.Golden gets it goingThe golden king crab fishery started on Aug. 15th signaling the start of fall crab seasons in the Bering Sea. Only five or six boats drop pots for golden kings, primarily in the deep waters off the Aleutian Islands. Golden king crab one of Alaska’s most stable crab fisheries, yielding a steady 5-6 million pounds each year.The outlook for this year’s catches of red king crab at Bristol Bay, and Bering Sea snow crab are less certain. Managers are still crunching the numbers from the summer surveys and Fish and Game will announce the catches in late September. Those fisheries start in mid-October.Looking at the competition:  The Barents Sea king crab fishery will be first out of the blocks next month and it will hit the US market at the same time as Alaska crab. Market watcher Ken Talley said small king crab is coming in from the Russian Far East, and Norway is ramping up its king crab sales to the U.S.  Talley said U.S. markets are awash with lower priced snow crab from Canada.  With tourism down 30 percent this summer, he said retailers are having trouble moving all the snow crab that is available.Name the ice breakerWhen it is completed in 2014, the Alaska Region Research Vessel will be one of the most technologically advanced oceanographic vessels in the world. The 242-foot vessel is designed for research in arctic and subarctic waters, and capable of breaking ice up to 2.5 feet thick.But it is missing something: a name.  The University of Alaska/Fairbanks is asking the public to submit ideas for the name of the research vessel.

Now we’ll have it every two years,” Osmond said.In the case of the Eliminator, it was bureaucracy that was keeping it on the beach.“The net was shown to be very effective for several years and they had been trying to get it through the bureaucratic process. And because NOAA is one of the supporters of the Smart Gear competition, we were able to help them navigate their way through that process,” Osmond said.The Eliminator was regulated for commercial use in the United States last August and is now being trialed in the United Kingdom and the North Sea.  Also undergoing trials is an innovation from one of the two $10,000 Smart Gear runners up:  a nested cylinder device from Mississippi, which uses light and water flow to reduce bycatch of red snapper by up to 80 percent in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  An Argentinean entry won for a simple plastic cone that attaches to trawl cables to keep away  sea birds.The 2007 Smart Gear contest attracted 70 entries from 22 countries, but only one from Alaska (down from four in 2006).“We would love to get more ideas from Alaska,” Osmond said. “Fishing is such a huge industry in Alaska, and obviously there are a lot of smart fishermen there. I can only think they don’t need the money.  But $30,000 isn’t anything to sneeze at,” he added with a laugh.The Smart Gear competition is open to all. But it’s the guys out on the water that have the best ideas, Osmond said.“They’ve come up with the ideas to reduce bycatch, and they’ve put it into practical  and it works.”The Smart Gear winners will be chosen in September by an international judging panel at the  International Fishing Exposition in Spain.

On February 10 at the Fare Start banquet facility in Seattle, the seafood products will be judged in three categories: retail, food service and smoked.“One of the noteworthies is a smoked salmon parfait by Sea Bear Seafoods,” said Jim Browning, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, host of the popular event.Seattle Symphony goers will choose a People’s Choice award, but no winners will be announced until the event moves to Anchorage for its ‘gala soiree’ sampling bash on Feb. 19 at the Captain Cook.The annual event attracts entries from both large and small Alaska seafood companies. Diamond Lodge Smokehouse of King Salmon, for example, has been a grand prize winner for its smoked halibut, and Boreal Fisheries of St. Mary’s also has taken home awards for its smoked king salmon strips.Winners in each category get a free trip to the International Boston Seafood show in March.  Tickets for Symphony of Seafood are on sale now at Center Tix.

A new report called “The Seafood Industry in Alaska ‘s Economy” provides a ‘one stop shop’ that outlines the  importance of fishing to Alaska and the nation.“A lot of reports come out by the Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and other sources, but they don’t pull all the components into one place. That was our goal,” said Dave Benton, director of the Marine Conservation Alliance, one of the trade groups that   commissioned the report by Northern Economics of Anchorage. The other groups are the At-sea Processors Association and Pacific Seafood Processors Association.“The message that comes through for Alaska is very dramatic,” Benton added.   “$5.8 billion worth of economic activity, 78,000 direct and indirect jobs, 80% of the manufacturing that goes on in Alaska is accountable to the seafood industry… Alaska is 9th in the world in terms of production, and provides 62% of U.S. seafood landings as well. That’s a pretty big record, and we’ve done it with no overfished stocks and on a sustainable basis for decades.”Other findings:  Alaska provides 96% of all U.S. salmon landings. Alaska’s seafood industry provides more jobs than oil, gas and mining combined.

Omegas also are being added to all kinds of foods – from eggs and orange juice, to breads and baby foods.Best estimates peg Alaska fish oil production at 10,000 tons per year. Note the value jumped from $4 million in 2000 to $30 million in 2007.It is difficult to quantify Alaska fish oil and meal production, because the fisheries are divided between state and federal jurisdictions, and there are different databases, said a 2008 report called ‘Alaska Seafood Byproducts: Potential Products, Markets and Competing Products” by Anthony Bimbo for AFDF.The Dept. of Fish and Game Department database contains information on fishmeal and oil produced from pollock, cod, yellowfin sole and sockeye salmon.  The Federal statistics group all sources of fishmeal and oil together. Bimbo estimates Alaska’s average fishmeal production at 217,000 tons from 2000-2007; there is no data available on production of salmon meal, and it’s not known how much is sold domestically.When he crunched the numbers, Bimbo called the potential values of Alaska fishmeal and oil “a real eye opener.” Assuming a 5 year average price for meal and oil from 2000 – 2007, Alaska could have produced somewhere between $80 million and $170 million of fishmeal and $7 – $22 million of fish oil.Questions?

It is a drug made from the milk of goats that have been altered to produce a protein that acts as a blood thinner.GM creatures are not clones, but rather animals that have had their DNA changed to produce a desirable characteristic. The science is widely used in agriculture to produce higher-yielding or disease-resistant crops, but it is the first time that modified animals have been given the ok for human medical use or consumption.Next to get the nod is likely to be  salmon. Aqua Bounty Farms in eastern Canada has been waiting more than a decade to get U.S. approval for its modified Atlantic salmon. The fish grow twice as fast as normal salmon, thanks to added genes from cold water fish. The FDA said no labeling is required that tells consumers their food purchases are genetically altered.Fish bits – Trident’s Thai Chili Salmon Fillets, made from chums, took home the People’s Choice at the Symphony of Seafood Feb. 10 in Seattle.

Mark Begich’s point person on fisheries and several other capacities.“My specific job responsibilities include staffing Sen. Begich on his appointment to the Commerce Committee, which includes a number of things that are really important to Alaska, such as fisheries, the Arctic and the Coast Guard,” King said in a phone interview from Juneau.King was news director at KDLG in Dillingham for nearly 20 years, and then moved to Juneau when he was tapped as press secretary for Gov. Tony Knowles. Most recently, he’s been director of the marine debris programs spearheaded by the Marine Conservation Alliance Foundation. King also has just completed a history of Alaska’s fisheries for the Department of Fish & Game for the state’s 50th anniversary.“In my work over the years, I’ve gotten to know people from the small boat fisheries and the setnetters all the way to the large at-sea processors,” King said. “I really have a sense of the importance of this industry from the big boats to the small boats that I will take back to Washington, D.C. and put to good use for the benefit of Alaska.”“Bob is well known throughout Alaska for his great expertise and knowledge about the fishing industry, but also in his capacity to look at many other issues we will be dealing with through the Commerce Committee. It’s a huge plus,” said Sen. Begich in a phone call from DC.  “He also has interest in one of my primary areas of focus – climate change and the impact it has on Alaska.”King said that it is really tough to leave Alaska, even temporarily. He said he is honored to join Sen. Begich in Washington, and that President Obama’s words have strongly resonated with him.“When he talked about a new era of responsibility for citizens to give our all to the difficult tasks that lie ahead – I’m anxious to be part of it.”Bob King will join the Begich team in D.C. in early February.Few fish so farThe Alaska legislature convened last week and there are few fishery-related bills so far. But that doesn’t mean much at this point.“Just because there are no bills the first week, doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a lot of fun to watch for the next three months,” said fisheries analyst Bob Tkacz, who has been watch dogging the Legislature for 15 years.Over-riding everything this year is money. Last year there was plenty, but that’s not the case now. Big oil bankrolls 90 percent of Alaska’s revenues and Gov. Palin’s budget is based on $70 per barrel oil; the real price is closer to $40 per barrel.“We’re in a budget cutting year this time around,” Tkacz said. “The bigger picture I believe is that this is Gov. Palin’s first budget cutting session in any of her executive experiences. So the big picture is how she is going to approach budget cutting and how much money we actually have.”It’s unlikely, for example, that the state will again pony up the $6 million or so to cover federal funding shortfalls in co-managed fisheries, such as Bering Sea crab. That could mean fewer surveys and less research data that managers depend on to set catch quotas.Tkacz said the new make up of the Legislature this year also raises some red flags when it comes to fisheries.“Anchorage and the Mat-Su have hugely important seats in the committees that are really important to fishermen,” he said.Craig Johnson and Mark Neuman, for example, chair the House Resources Committee, two leaders of the Cook Inlet Salmon Task Force who are both critical of commercial fishing catch quotas. Bill Stoltze, co-chair of the House Finance Committee, also is a critic of commercial fishing in the Inlet. On the Senate side, Resources is controlled by Bill Wielechowski and Lesil McGuire of Anchorage, who also is no fan of the fishing industry at Cook Inlet.“There is incredible potential for games playing here,” Tkacz said.Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham heads the House Special Committee on Fisheries.Other fish friendly lawmakers are at Senate Finance, co-chaired by Sitka’s Bert Stedman and Lyman Hoffman of Bethel. Speaker of the House is Mike Chenault from Nikiski and Gary Stevens of Kodiak as Senate president.“So the fishing industry has strong support at the very top, but what kinds of bills will get to the top is a huge question,” Tkacz said. “Who controls the gavel dictates where things go.”Bob Tkacz’s ‘Laws for the Sea’ provides the most in depth look at fish policies and personalities each week during the legislative session. Sign on at junobob@att.netSlow down, save fuelA survey by Alaska Sea Grant and United Fishermen of Alaska asked fishermen to share how they dealt with the sky-rocketing cost of diesel fuel  – which topped $5 a gallon last summer – and to share energy saving ideas.Many of the 126 respondents said they fished less, skipped openers, fished closer to home or ended their season earlier.  Other findings: 43 percent said between 10-20 percent of their gross income was spent on fuel last year. Nearly 62 percent said they hired fewer or no crew, and crew shares were lower. Sixty-two percent also said they believed fishery management decisions affected their fuel consumption, but more than half said managers should not make decisions based on the price of fuel.In terms of fuel saving techniques – 76 percent said they throttled back and slowed down. Seventy-seven percent cited maintaining engines and fuel systems. Also popular – good route planning and timing, keeping a clean hull to reduce drag and properly tuning propellers. Several fishermen credited buying fuel from processors, who bought in bulk and passed on the savings. Many expressed interest in getting help to compare different engines, and learning how to use energy saving devices like flow meters.The Sea Grant/UFA survey will be used to develop workshops and other tools to help fishermen save on high fuel costs.

None was wearing a PFD. Many were in minutes of being rescued when they lost strength and drowned. In those cases it very clearly could have been prevented with a PFD,” said Devin Lucas, a project leader for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.But fishermen resist wearing PFDs, and safety specialists want to turn that around.“A lot of fishermen tell us PFDs are bulky and hot and heavy, too uncomfortable to work in. We started wondering if the newer models would face the same kinds of problems as with the older, bulkier foam PFDs,” Lucas said.The project targeted fishermen in Dutch Harbor, King Salmon, Kodiak, Homer, Seward and Bristol Bay, and included several different gear groups. Each of the 216 fishermen first filled out a survey asking them about their attitudes and knowledge about PFDs, and their perceived level of risk of falling overboard. Then they were randomly assigned six new styles of PFDs, which they wore for 30 days while fishing.“When the guys looked at the types of PFDs we wanted them to try out they were really excited, because many had not seen the newer models and the features they have,” said Dr. Jennifer Lincoln, director of the Anchorage-based NIOSH Commercial Fishing Safety Research program.After the month-long field test, the fishermen were asked to rate the PFDs, to provide any modifications  and “to describe what the perfect PFD is,” Lincoln said.One that holds promise comes from Norway – it includes flotation in the chest and back of the bibs in rain gear.“We are really curious to see what they think about that, because it was developed for fishermen specifically,” Lincoln said.Another model automatically inflates with a hydrostatic release when a person hits the water.“But I think the guys are a little hesitant about inflatable PFDs because they are afraid they will inflate while they’re working,” Lincoln said. “And that’s the point of the whole study –to see if these assumptions are true.”Lincoln and Lucas said they were pleasantly surprised at how enthusiastic the fishermen were to take part in the PFD project. They are collecting their evaluations now, and still awaiting returns from a few stragglers.Responses by longliners and salmon gillnetters at Bristol Bay are lagging well behind the trawlers and crabbers from Dutch Harbor, Lincoln said.“Maybe we can start a little friendly fishing rivalry,” she added with a laugh.The ultimate goal is to take the recommendations to gear manufacturers and get more fishing-friendly PFDs out on the water.“But unless the fishermen tell us, we can’t go back to the manufacturer with any good information,” Lincoln said.Results of the PFD study will be revealed at Pacific Marine Expo in November.Skinny pinks –Water samples collected this spring from the Gulf of Alaska show that acid levels are increasing more quickly and more severely than previously thought. The Gulf findings are similar to those seen in the Chukchi and Bering Seas.Increased acidity robs the ocean of calcium carbonate, the building block of sea creatures’ skeletons and shells. Alaska researchers already are seeing signs of corrosion in tiny shrimp-like pteropods – which make up 45 percent of the diet of Alaska pink salmon.“A 10 percent drop in pteropod production would lead to about a 20 percent drop in salmon body weight. Obviously, the loss of pteropods would be extremely detrimental to pink salmon populations,” said Bob Foy, director of the NOAA Research lab at Kodiak.“We’re not talking one hundred years here,” echoed Jeremy Mathis, a chemical oceanographer at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks. “This is likely to happen within decades.”“We need to give our policy makers and managers information and forecasts on ocean acidification in Alaska so they can make decisions that will keep our fisheries viable,” Mathis said. “Ecosystems in Alaska are going to take a hit and right now, we don’t know how they are going to respond.”Wanted: fish pix –The call is out for Alaska fishing photos to be used for promotions by Alaska Airlines and the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. Selected photos also will be featured in one of the most popular trades, Pacific Fishing Magazine.“Our goal is to put a good face on the product that Alaska provides. I think the best way to do that is by focusing on the people – the men and women who do such a fine job of catching the fish,” Don McManman, magazine editor.The print or digital photos must be taken in Alaska. The top prize is two tickets anywhere Alaska Airlines flies.

Yukon River salmon fishermen netted paychecks of only about $2,300 last summer; now many are forced to choose between buying food and fuel. To make matters worse, an early freeze prevented supply ships from making annual deliveries.News of their plight, and the Katrina-like response from state leaders, has moved people from across the nation to donate food and fuel to help the far away First Alaskans.“One Nunam Iqua resident told me ‘it has never been this bad.’” Quite a statement from a people who have lived in the same place for 10,000 years,” said Jon Rowley who works with Emmonak-based Kwik’Pak Fisheries to market Yukon kings and chums to select buyers.Among them is Elliot’s Oyster House in Seattle, where 25 percent of all Yukon king dinners is being donated to a fuel fund during the month of February.  The Flying Fish restaurant also raised $1,600 for a fuel fund that is being sent to the village of Nunam Iquaa (population 200).  Rowley said he also is getting calls from restaurants in D.C. and Las Vegas wanting to help.“People are very surprised and aggrieved to learn that there are people in Alaska in this kind of situation,” Rowley said.Chicago-based Plitt Company, a major buyer of Alaska seafood and a big fan of Yukon salmon, donated the $500 pot from its annual Super Bowl squares to Western Alaska fishing families. Plitt also is rallying others to help out, said Mary Smith, director of marketing.“The salmon we sell from the Yukon is one of the most expensive products we bring in, and it seemed to us that the high income people who enjoy this product would support giving something back,”she said.Yukon fishermen are bracing for another heart breaker this year. Fish managers predict the low king salmon runs could reduce or cancel commercial openers; even subsistence fishing might be curtailed.  However, some salvation could come from the Yukon’s more abundant chum salmon, which Rowley calls “a real discovery.”Rowley, who is credited with launching Copper River salmon into the limelight years ago,  now says he’s hooked on building market momentum for “Yukon Keta.”“It’s a different fish altogether- probably different enough that it should be a sub-species. It’s deep orange – even when the chums are a few hundred miles up the river, they are still bright and shiny. It’s a beautiful fish,” Rowley said. “Plus, the kings and fall chums from the Yukon have more omega 3?s than any other fish in the ocean – and not just a little more, about twice as much.”Meanwhile, volunteers are distributing food and other goods to the Yukon communities. The people will get some relief this month with 100 gallon fuel vouchers – from Venezuela. Donations can be sent to the Nunam Iqua-Traditional Council, Nunam Iqua, AK  99666, or contact  rowley@nwlink.com/.Alaska seafood repackaged – Alaska needs to ‘repackage’ its fishing industry to make more of an impact on national policy makers. That’s a first impression by Senator Mark Begich after his first few weeks in Congress.“Maybe it’s just my perspective from being a new guy here, but we talk about ‘Alaska fisheries’ and I think people view it as just that,” Begich said in a phone conversation. “We have to repackage what we’re talking about. Alaska’s fisheries impact the global food chain – it’s a huge industry for our country, not just for Alaska. So we have to explain it that way, so we get a longer term view of how fishing is an economic driver, and has national and international impacts.”Sen. Begich said he is no fan of the idea that regional fisheries management is better served in far away Washington, D.C.  He said Alaska’s “reliance on science” is a model for other regions — and consistent with President Obama’s message that science will drive policy.“To me that plays very well for Alaska, because that is what makes our fisheries so strong. It shows when we focus on the science rather than the politics, we end up with better long term, sustainable fisheries. The science is what’s going to drive this, and the local input is going to be the player here,” he said.Senator Begich believes that climate changes pose the biggest long term threat to fisheries in Alaska and the nation.“We need to understand what we can do now for long term sustainability,” he said.Begich added that he will work closely with Sen. Lisa Murkowski to advance the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty, which governs activities on, over and beneath the Arctic Ocean. The U.S. remains the only Arctic nation that has not signed on to the treaty.Lice lawsuit – Sea lice from salmon farms has spawned a lawsuit by First Nations tribes in Vancouver. The tribes and environmental groups for years have complained that fish wastes and high numbers of sea lice from open net fish farms are decimating wild salmon stocks in traditional territories. British Columbia has authorized 29 fish farm sites at Broughton Archipelago, a cluster of islands in northern Vancouver. The legal action will be the first class-action lawsuit in Canada aimed to protect aboriginal treaty rights.<COL>Salmon fans donate fish<COL>2009-02-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/09/%e2%80%98walking-fish%e2%80%99-program-distributes-free-seafood/<COL>‘Walking Fish’ program distributes free seafoodBy Laine WelchePrograms that dole out catch shares of fish are a hot-button issue in the fishing industry, but here’s one that everyone likes.Community-supported fisheries programs sell catch shares to customers, entitling them to weekly or bi-weekly deliveries of a wide variety of locally caught fish and shellfish. The concept is modeled after “buy local” agriculture programs that have popped up all over the country. CSFs are already active throughout New England, but the concept has yet to head west.“It’s a very new concept for seafood, but people are already used to hearing about supporting their local farmers, so supporting their fishermen and women is just an extension of that,” said Jason Horay, Health Education Manager at Duke University in North Carolina. “We call them ‘mobile markets.’ It’s really catching on.”Duke is home to the nation’s newest CSF called “Walking Fish,” which is set to distribute its first 350 pounds of pre-sold seafood to customers this week. Full shares provide between 3–5 pounds of mixed fish; half-shares include 1-3 pounds per week. Prices range from $70 to $420, depending on preparation and delivery frequency. The pilot project aims to sell 1,000 pounds of local fish and shellfish over 12 weeks, and repeat in the spring.“We want to prove to ourselves, the fishermen and the consumers that this is something that has long-term potential,” said Josh Stoll, an environmental management student and organizer of Walking Fish. “We’re trying to build off existing infrastructure, but also increase the price points for the fishermen.”Most CSFs so far are operated by fishing groups – a church group runs one in Maine – with close connections to local harvesters. That was a critical link that Walking Fish lacked.In March, Stoll turned to veterans at Carteret Catch, a trade group that promotes North Carolina’s 400-year-old fishing heritage. Nearly half of the states’ seafood comes from Carteret County.“We had access to the market, resources and funding, but no knowledge of the fisheries or community members that need to be involved,” Stoll said.  “It turns out they’re asking the same questions: How do we market our seafood? How do we sustain local communities? Our missions really overlapped.”Carteret Catch rallied its network of fishermen and other seafood experts, and Walking Fish got underway.“You need a place, as in a fish house or inspected facility to ensure quality control, and you need people to take orders and get them ready to go out, and transportation that maintains the quality of the seafood to the customer,” said Carteret Catch president and former fisherman Pam Morris. “It’s not something that one or two people get together and make it happen. It’s very complicated. But the ones I’ve seen work pretty well.”Morris said CSF surveys show that supporting their local fishing industry ranks No. 1 among consumers.“People like supporting the community and they want the fishing industry to survive as part of their heritage and their culture,” she said. “This gives them a way to do it, and they are proud of it.”Morris said they also want quality.“They want to know where their seafood comes from, and that it’s a local product that has not been treated with chemicals and all the other things they hear about,” she explained. “Those are the top reasons they want to buy into CSFs.”The community-supported projects also provide customers a voice in their food choices.“The consumer rarely has a seat when it comes to regulatory concerns,” Morris added. “You never hear about just the regular old person who likes to eat seafood. You’re always hearing from every other group out there except the consumer.”CSFs also educate people about the seasonal nature of seafood, Morris said, and bring the “true story” to consumers.“People have forgotten where their food comes from,” she said. “And they are spoon-fed so much propaganda and misinformation about the commercial fishing industry. We can help dispel that directly.”Buying direct from local sources also brings in more income for producers, and helps promote more sustainable fishing practices,” Josh Stoll added.As Walking Fish gets its legs, he said the goal is to replicate the project in other communities.“The goals are simple: to foster economic opportunities, to cultivate healthy communities and to encourage good stewardship,” Stoll said. “We want to help support fishermen in any way we can and we really believe the consumer has a role in that.”Pam Morris believes Walking Fish projects pay another dividend that goes beyond the bottom line.“It tells the fishermen that you’re a valuable person – that you’re valuable to the economy, and to culture of the area. That’s an added benefit,” she said.Walking Fish is funded by DukeFish, a chapter of the American Fisheries Society, and the university’s Sustainability Office.  www.walking-fish.orgOcto-StudyState and federal researchers are partnering with Alaska divers to learn more about octopus in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea.Octopus are caught accidentally in other fisheries and can be sold. However, there are no directed fisheries – except by special permit in state waters. Prices to fishermen for octopus range from about 65 cents to 90 cents a pound, and octopus fetch a buck a pound sold as halibut bait. More market demand is boosting interest in Alaska octopus, but before any fishery can occur, much more needs to be known about the creatures.“If there is something in a fishery management plan that is sold for market, the law requires that we must set an annual catch limit on it,” said project leader Elizabeth Connors at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. “We have very little information on octopus from which to set a catch limit. We know next to nothing about them.”Connors said learning about octopus reproductive seasons is the place to start. The best guess now is that octopus in the Gulf and Bering Sea have distinct reproductive seasons, with mating in late summer to early fall, spawning into the winter, and incubation into early spring. The researchers also aim to learn if Alaska octopus have a seasonal migration pattern, as they do in Japan.Connors said of the seven or eight octopus species found in Alaska, the project will focus on the giant Pacific octopus, which can weigh more than 50 pounds.Researchers are asking divers near Kodiak, Dutch Harbor and Juneau to watch for octopus, and to note the size, general location, time and date, and whether other octopus are in the vicinity. Connors said researchers are especially interested in sightings of octopus dens containing eggs.“We’re really interested in where and when the eggs show up in the dens. They lay big long strings of eggs that look like grains of rice on a string – and they’ll hang from the roof of the den,” Connors told KDLG.The scientists will begin paying monthly visits to octopus dens starting next fall. ADF&G will assist the project by providing specimens and testing new octopus pot gear. The octopus project is funded by the North Pacific Research Board.“Octo-guide– A Guide to Squids and Octopods of the Eastern North Pacific and Bering Sea”, is hot off the press at www.alaskaseagrant.org<COL>‘Walking Fish’ program distributes free seafood<COL>2009-09-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/09/sea-otters-take-a-bite-out-of-commerical-fisheries/<COL>Sea otters take a bite out of commerical fisheriesBy Laine WelchSeveral things pose dangers to various fisheries in Alaska, but there is one big threat in the Panhandle that is seldom mentioned: sea otters.Sea otters in Southeast Alaska were hunted almost to extinction by Russian fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, and estimates peg the population at just 2,000 in 1911. Sea otters were re-introduced to the region by ADF&G in the 1960s; within a decade their numbers reached 160,000 animals, and otter counts have grown exponentially ever since.Sea otters can grow larger than four feet and weigh up to 90 pounds. They are voracious feeders and eat 25 percent of their body weight each day. Sea otters are blamed in part for the collapse of the lucrative abalone fishery, which ended in 1995.“It is clear that abalone cannot co-exist in commercial quantities with sea otters,” said a 1999 fishery report to the state Board of Fisheries.Now, their appetites are starting to take a bite out of other commercially important species.“We’ve closed many fisheries now – sea cucumbers, urchins, and just this last year we closed the first geoduck fishery due to presumed sea otter predation,”   said Zac Hoyt, a diver and research biologist at ADF&G in Petersburg.“When you’re under water in a geoduck bed, it’s pretty amazing how efficient otters are at getting these big clams that burrow two or three feet under the substrate,” he added. “It’s literally like a back hoe has been on the bottom in those sandy areas.”No one knows how many sea otters have set up housekeeping in Southeast or how much shellfish they’re feasting upon. Hoyt and Sunny Rice, the local Sea Grant marine advisor, aim to start finding out.“The first step of our proposed project is to get an estimate of how many otters are in southern Southeast before we can move forward with anything else,” Rice said, adding that concerns by fishermen and subsistence users prompted the study.More fishermen, especially Dungeness crabbers, are telling her they are being forced out of traditional areas by sea otters, Rice said. Should they be holding on to their dungie permits?“The reason we’re tackling this whole thing is due to a lack of scientific information,” Rice said. “It would be nice to verify what we’re hearing from commercial fishermen – they’ll go into a bay and see evidence of otter predation all along the shore, and at the same time, they’re not catching any crab in their pots.”“We want to try and estimate the take of four commercially important species by sea otters – Dungeness crab, geoduck clams, urchins and sea cucumbers,” Hoyt added.The project also aims to learn how far the otters are foraging.“Is there some reason why they haven’t come all the way into the far inside waters of Southeast Alaska, or have they just not gotten here yet? That’s an important question for fishing fleets,” Rice said.How fishermen and otters might co-exist remains a big question.   Complicating the problem — sea otters are listed as a protected species by the federal government and cannot be harassed in any way.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service will collaborate with the two year project.Pollock does acidChemistry proves Alaska’s oceans are more acidic, and it is affecting the ability of tiny sea creatures to grow shells.  But what about direct impacts of ocean acidification on the state’s largest fishery?“We know there is going to be some impact on the calcifying organisms which make up a lot of the diet of the commercially valuable species. But we don’t yet understand what the direct physiological impact is going to be on pollock,” said Jeremy Mathis,  a chemical oceanographer at the University of Alaska School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences at Fairbanks.With funding from the Pollock Conservation Research Cooperative, Mathis and colleagues this week will begin an experiment on one year old pollock, hatched and reared at the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Oregon.  Over  three months the fish will be tested at acidity levels that are predicted to occur over the next 100 years. A second phase next spring will focus on newly hatched larval pollock.“We will have a control tank of pollock growing under current levels, and compare growth rate – all of the indicators of health, metabolism and physiology,” Mathis said.  “I believe increased acidity levels will boost stress hormones in the fish. But we won’t be able to tell that until we do some of these comprehensive studies.”Alaska pollock accounts for one-third of total U.S. fish landings. The pollock study will serve as a base line for other commercial fish species, such as cod.  Mathis said results will be published next summer.Plankton PowerAn algae bio-refinery is getting underway on Cape Cod in Massachusetts aimed at soon producing 5 percent of the state’s diesel and home heating oil.  The project is a partnership with a Wellfleet start-up called Plankton Power, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Regional Technology Development Corp. and the National Guard.Cape Cod is among the world’s most productive fishing grounds.“When you have a world-class resource and world-class marine scientists in the same location, that’s really a dream come true,” said Plankton Power CEO Curt Felix.The Guard is providing five acres on its base in Falmouth to begin the venture. The project will grow algae in fully contained re-circulating seawater systems to produce oil, and tap wastewater from the military base for nutrients. Carbon dioxide will be added from several sources, including industries. The mix will initially generate up to 1 million gallons of biodiesel a year, enough to meet the needs of Cape Cod. Expansion to 100 acres and 100 million gallons of biodiesel a year will meet 5 percent of the state’s demand.Algae biodiesel has a composition that is almost identical to petroleum diesel, but is more efficient and produces lower emissions, said Plankton Power  CEO Curt Felix.  Most algae fuels have been tested and grown in warmer climes, but the Cape Cod strain thrives in cold saltwater in low light. Because cold tends to prompt more fat storage, the cold water algae produces and stores more oil. Algae can be turned into biofuel in just three weeks, compared to six months for vegetable oils.Exxon Mobil has reportedly invested $600 million in algae biofuel testing.www.planktonpower.netFish high fiveLaws for the SEA won third place in the 2009 Capitolbeat awards in the “beat reporting” category.

Nearly 200 divers also begin heading down to the icy depths to handpick pricey sea cucumbers, urchins and giant geoduck clams (pronounced “gooey-ducks”). Geoducks average three pounds, but can weigh up to 10 pounds. Their name is derived from a Nisqually Indian term meaning “dig deep.”Southeast divers will compete for 600,000 pounds of geoducks, 1.5 million pounds of sea cukes and 5 million pounds of red sea urchins in the coming months. A small sea cucumber fishery (140,000 pounds) also occurs around Kodiak Island.  Dive fisheries of 5,000 pounds of cukes also occur at Chignik and along the Alaska Peninsula.Sea cucumbers fetch about $2.50 a pound for divers, geoduck clams get $3.50-$3.90 per pound live, ($1 per pound processed); red urchins average about 35 cents a pound. Nearly all go to Asian markets.Also in October:Southeast trollers will be back out on the water on Oct. 11 targeting winter kings. Alaska’s biggest crab fisheries get underway in the Bering Sea on Oct. 15. At the same time, sablefish and halibut fisheries are ongoing until mid-November. Fishing for cod, pollock, flounder and many other species also continues throughout the year.Crab cutsHolding true to a precautionary course in fishery oversight, managers have reduced the 2009/2010 catches for Alaska’s largest crab fisheries in the Bering Sea.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced last week that the quota for snow crab will be cut to 48 million pounds; an 18-percent decrease from recent years. Still, stakeholders breathed a sigh of relief, as they had feared a far lower snow crab catch to help speed up a stock rebuilding plan.A bigger surprise is the sizable cut to red king crab at Bristol Bay. Discussions for months had largely suggested the catch could remain status quo at 20 million pounds. Instead, the red king crab catch was reduced to just 16 million pounds; a decrease of 21.4 percent. The Tanner crab take also was reduced to 1.3 million pounds, taken from the eastern region only. Fishery managers said the lower catch quotas also account for the estimated numbers of crab taken as bycatch and accidental mortality rates.For the first time in a decade, a blue king crab fishery will open way out west at St. Matthew Island, with a catch guideline of just over one million pounds. The Bering Sea crab fisheries get underway Oct. 15.Crabbers in Southeast were disappointed again by the cancellation of the November red king crab fishery. That fishery has been closed since 1991, and managers claim the number of male crabs is at its lowest level in 16 years. Crabbers, on the other hand, question the validity of the surveys, and believe they are not a complete indication of the health of the crab stocks.Looking at crab markets, less king crab all around could boost prices across the board. The Dungeness market is reportedly clamoring for crab, and Alaska will be competing for shelf space with bigger west coast fisheries. For snow crab, the market is said to be well-stocked, with lots of crab still available from Canada.Fish for the hungryAmerican Seafoods Group was recognized last week for reaching the milestone of donating 10 million seafood meals to hungry Americans.  The donations go to SeaShare, which – since 1994 – has worked with the seafood industry to provide more than 130 million seafood meals to food banks, shelters and soup kitchens across the United States. The nonprofit SeaShare is now one of the largest sources of protein for hunger relief in the nation.

A harvest of nearly 40 million pinks was predicted at PWS this summer, but the catch came in at 16.5 million fish. Statewide, the total pink salmon harvest squeaked past 94 million fish; 20 million less than projected.A couple hundred thousand chums might still be landed, and the statewide tally was nearing 17 million, not too far off the forecast. Likewise, coho catches are still coming in and likely to approach the 4-million-fish forecast.Bruce said the harvest of 321,000 king salmon this summer was mediocre.“We didn’t get anything out of the Yukon. Southeast had a relatively small quota under the Pacific salmon treaty, and kings in the Copper River were poor,” he explained. “It wasn’t really a good year for king salmon.”State number crunchers will compute the values of the various salmon catches over the next few weeks. It’s too soon to say if the dockside payday of the 2009 harvest will top last year’s value of $452 million.“Remember back in 2000 and 2001 we were down around $200 million. So the overall value has really improved a lot,”  Bruce added. “If prices are not too far from last year, it should still be a good payday.”Average dock prices (ex-vessel) for Alaska salmon in 2008 were 35 cents per pound for pink salmon, 59 cents for chums, 84 cents for sockeye salmon, $1.28 a pound for cohos and $4.54 for king salmon.Pinks trouncedAlaska’s pink salmon catch of 93 million fell well-shy of projections – but the “supply and demand” principle isn’t likely to boost fish prices this year.“If you looked at that alone, you’d think the pink prices ought to be up,” said Fisheries Economist Gunnar Knapp at the University of Alaska Anchorage. “But there’s a global recession going on, and we’re not the only people in the world who produce pink salmon. In fact, the Russians produce a lot more pink salmon than we do.”How much more?This summer, Russian fleets reportedly hauled in at least 350,000 metric tons of pink salmon; tonnage that translates to roughly 200 million fish.“That’s a huge number – higher than Alaska has ever harvested and a very significant record for Russia,” Knapp said.The biggest driver of pink salmon prices is the roe, and Russia is one of Alaska’s biggest customers. But Russia’s haul has brought the hammer down on that market.“Probably the most important factor affecting the market for pink salmon compared to last year is the change in roe prices,” Knapp said.  “Roe markets are way, way down.”According to industry reports, pink salmon roe prices have dropped below $3 per pound, compared to over $7 per pound last year.The pink salmon price to Alaska fishermen in 2008 averaged 35 cents per pound; most reports indicate a drop at the docks of roughly 5-8 cents per pound this year. Fish and Game and the State Department of Revenue will have more complete salmon price reports in the next couple of months.Get steamedInstead of going up the smoke stack, steam generated by large equipment in processing plants can be recaptured and reused as energy.“Typically, in industrial steam boilers, anywhere from 15-25 percent of the energy that goes into the boiler is lost up the stack,” said Ed Stoermer of Stoermer Industrial Energy Systems in Cincinnati, Ohio.Large food-processing plants generate hundreds of thousands of pounds of steam per hour, fueled by natural gas, oil or coal.“To generate the steam, there is inefficiency with the combustion and the steam-production cycle,” Stoermer said. “The energy that is lost is exhausted out into the atmosphere.”Recapturing that steam benefits a company’s pocketbook and the planet.“It not only reduces the amount of energy they need to purchase, they are also reducing – by an equivalent amount – emissions that are dumped into the atmosphere,” he added.Stoermer said steam recapture systems easily fit into a plant’s existing infrastructure. The easiest way to save energy, he added, is by improving the efficiency of the equipment on hand.“All kinds of new technologies are coming to market – solar, geothermal, wind power… but those are tough to harness for the average industrial client,” Stoermer said. “A straightforward approach is to recapture some of the energy that is lost at their plants, whether that is the heat of compression due to refrigeration systems, or recovering energy from the stacks, or some of the blow down or lost energy from the boilers. Those are going to be the simplest steps they can take to reduce their costs and emissions.”Check out Stoermer Industrial Energy Systems atwww.stoermer-ies.com<COL>Statewide salmon 2009 – a mixed bag of fish<COL>2009-09-23<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/03/prices-hinge-on-international-fishing/<COL>Prices hinge on international fishingJapan is Alaska’s most important seafood customer, and a sliding economy there can be worrisome for the state’s seafood industry. But it is important not to jump to conclusions when it comes to predicting how it will affect fish prices.“You can’t just look at the state of the economy and say that explains everything, and all fish prices will be going down,” said Gunnar  Knapp, a fisheries economist at the University of Alaska/Anchorage.“It is always important to keep in mind that fish prices are driven by lots of different factors, and you need to look at all their combined effects to even begin to understand what might be driving a price. And it is often hard to separate how much influence each effect has.”Knapp said there are two things that should always be considered anytime you’re talking prices for any kind of Alaska fish product: supplies from around the world and currency exchange rates.“If the value of the foreign currency is getting stronger relative to the dollar, that can drive up prices even if other factors, like the economy, are pushing them down,” Knapp said.That has been the trend in Japan, where the value of the yen has increased dramatically over the past 18 months.“In mid-2007, a hundred yen was worth 82 cents, and now it’s worth $1.11. That’s an increase of 20 percent,” Knapp said. “So that is a very significant factor for any product selling to Japan. It would suggest that even if prices were going down, they could still be up by 10 percent or so in what the Japanese buyers are willing to pay in dollars.”That is certainly how it’s played out for the Bering  Sea crab fisheries. Japan purchased the bulk of the red king crab from Bristol Bay, and at 91 yen to the dollar, snow crab was also seen as a good buy.Japanese buyers paid $3.75 a pound for snow crab, said market expert Ken Talley, and with freezers nearly empty of holdings, U.S. crab lovers are also eager to buy.Meanwhile, the herring roe market is also taking an interesting turn. Herring roe was a best seller last year, according to 18 of Japan’s largest seafood companies. Traditionally, herring roe was a prized – and pricey – delicacy in Japan where virtually all of Alaska’s product goes.  About a decade ago, however, changing appetites pushed down interest in the roe, and the market has been in a slump ever since. The global recession appears to be changing that trend: Seafood.com reported sales of flavored and salted herring roe are on a big upswing, reflecting belt tightening by consumers who are dining out less frequently.More Europeans are eating seafood at home more often as well, as the value of the euro and the British pound have dropped like a stone for the past year.“This exchange rate factor that’s been a good thing for us in terms of the Japanese market is probably going to play the other way in our European markets, which is unfortunate,” Knapp said.New dates, new digs for ComFishKodiak is cornering the ‘fish angle’ of Alaska’s 50th anniversary celebrations. The push to statehood was driven in large part by Alaska’s fisheries. Kodiak is using its annual ComFish trade show to showcase 50 years of Alaska’s fishing and seafood processing industry.ComFish has attracted a lot of interest from new exhibitors from as far away as New  Zealand, said Deb King, executive director of the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce, sponsor of the event, now in its 29th year.“We got a lot of enthusiasm from folks at Expo in Seattle. They are very eager to visit a busy working waterfront in one of our nation’s biggest and most diverse fishing ports,” King said. “Plus, nothing can replace face to face interactions, the chance to network and catch up with old friends.”Also planned is a 50th anniversary recognition banquet to honor “movers and shakers” in Alaska’s seafood industry.“That will bring some really high profile people to town,” King said, adding that she is awaiting confirmations from Gov. Palin and Alaska’s congressional offices.ComFish has new dates and a new venue this year: April 23-25 at the Kodiak Harbor  Convention Center right downtown. Tickets for the seafood banquet extravaganza are on sale now at www.comfishalaska.com – and they’ll go fast.Fish bitsBreweries could be a new source for fish food!  Colorado’s New Belgium Brewery has teamed with a company called Oberon FMR (fish meal replacement) to produce a feed from the thick brown dregs that occur as a byproduct of beer brewing. New Belgium produces up to 50,000 lbs of the sludge each day, and Oberon believes it can convert the stuff into a rich source of fish feed. It’s being tested now at the University  of Idaho.It turns out that the swarms of Namura jellyfish that have been plaguing Japanese fisheries can be put to good use. Japanese scientists at TokaiUniversity have discovered the jellyfish have a protein called  mucin that helps regrow the cartilage in joints. In tests with rabbits, worn-down cartilage totally regrew in just 10 weeks. The research will be reported this month at the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine in Tokyo.Londoners have found a solution to invasive species – eat them!

The event was the community’s way of recognizing the nearly 800 seafood processing workers that come to Cordova each summer from all over the world.“There were teams and folks from the Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic, Central America, the Caribbean, Turkey, you name it  – even the ref who did all 10 games is  a professional soccer judge in his other life in the Ukraine,” said Torie Baker, a Sea Grant marine advisor in Cordova.Vying to win were teams from Ocean Beauty, Copper River Seafoods and Trident’s north and south plants. Some processors even held playoffs within their own ranks to see who’d go to the big game, Baker said.“Ocean Beauty had playoffs and their Mexican team defeated the Turkish team so they got to represent Ocean Beauty,” she said.The idea for a competition stemmed from the Cordova processors and the Park and Rec. Department, which had set up  a makeshift soccer area in the local park for the workers to use during breaks and time off.“We immediately capitalized on that and organized the tournament, along with a barbecue picnic. It took off like wildfire,” Baker said.Elders were brought over from the senior center and given prime seats on the field, and school classes were let out so kids could watch the international competition.“It was awesome,” said Martin Moe, president of the Cordova Chamber of Commerce. “You know, these workers are part of our community for up to six months each year.  This was such a great way to bring people together so that each one recognizes they are all part of our community.”“Wow, there was a mass of people around,” Baker added. “We felt like we’d been dropped into the middle of some London soccer match with the fans singing and waving banners and shaking noise makers – it was pretty amazing.”And the winner is……. Ocean Beauty won the match against Copper River Seafoods by 6-1; third place went to the Trident north facility in overtime over Trident south.Cordova has already issued an invitation to more teams next summer.“We are challenging Peter Pan in Valdez and Great Pacific in Whittier to bring their best teams over on the fast ferry,” Baker said.“Heck, let’s extend the invitation to teams from Homer, Seward and Kodiak, too!” said Moe.All winning teams will live forever on a perpetual trophy from the Chamber of Commerce that Moe has dubbed the Slammin’ Salmon Soccer Cup. The four foot trophy is topped with a scrimshaw pictogram of a king salmon flipping a soccer ball through the waves.Net recycling runs smoothlyFive Alaska fishing communities launched no-cost fishing net recycling programs this summer – Petersburg, Cordova, Kenai, Naknek and Dillingham. Each got $13,000 in seed money from the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission to coordinate a nylon  net recycling program for two months over two summers. The towns all had attempted net recycling programs years ago, but failed for various reasons. By all accounts, the latest efforts have gone better than expected.A full van load of old web just left Dillingham, said project director Billy Maines of the Curyung Tribe.“It was pretty busy,” Maines said. “Not only from the fishermen, but also some of the canneries and local net hangers had kept old web stored next to their shops, and when they heard we were recycling it, they brought them over by the truckloads.”Nets are still being dropped off he said.“It’s safe to say I’ve got 20 to 30 shackles sitting here by the office  waiting for us to do it again next year,” Maines said.Ditto at Naknek, where nets are still being dropped off, said Donna Williams of the Native Village Council.  Naknek already has shipped out 45,000 pounds of recyclable nylon nets in two container vans.Williams said word got out before the  salmon season  at the annual Fishermen’s Send Off, and the whole community was very involved.“We’ll catch them at the start of the season, in mid April when the net hangers come out to redo nets before the season starts, then again at the end of the season,” Williams said. “We’ll get lots more nets next year – four or five vans.”Cordova fishermen have filled six 20-foot containers with donated nets so far.“It’s actually going a lot smoother than I had thought,” said  project director Michelle Dawkins with the Copper River Watershed Project.Dawkins said salmon fishermen have really embraced the recycling project.“The guys like to point out how their nets are free of corks and lead lines when the drop them off – they’re really proud of it. I didn’t know if it would be viewed as just more work for the fishermen, but the whole town is into it, so it’s really cool,” Dawkins said. She added that she has received calls from Unalaska and Juneau about starting similar programs.At Kenai, the borough is pitching in to cover costs for continuing the program, said Audrey Stevens at the United Cook Inlet Drift Association.The net recycling project is just gearing up at Petersburg, where most of the fleet is still out fishing. Ben Johnson, project director for the Petersburg Indian Association, said the goal right now is to get the word out.“We’re doing everything we can to make sure people understand it’s going to be easy, painless for the fishermen, and it’s good for all involved,” Johnson said. “We’re just waiting for them to finish up the season at the end of September or early October. We expect to have nets dropped off all through the winter.”Alaska shipping companies have donated space to take the recycled nets  to Seattle, where they are offloaded and taken to Skagit River Steel and Recycling in Burlington. The nets are ground up, pelletized, and sold to plastics manufacturers.  The price a community can receive for the webbing depends on the market and how the nets are handled, said recycler Lois Young. Generally, they get about 4 cents a pound, sometimes 6-8 cents, and it can go as high as 11-15 cents a pound (rare). Having the nets bagged or bundled tightly before shipping reduces labor costs and fetches a higher price.Eco-crab potsAlaska’s crab industry is gearing up for its biggest fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea. The seasons for red king crab and snow crab kick off on October 15th.  That means tens of thousands of big ‘7 bys’ will be launched overboard – but in Alaska, all pots have built in protections.“All  commercial,  subsistence and personal use crab pots must have a mechanism that biodegrades in salt water over time to allow crabs and other animals to escape, if the pot is accidentally lost or left unattended,” said Wayne Donaldson, regional shellfish manager at ADF&G in Kodiak,Biodegradable twine has been required since the late 1970s, and is also used in groundfish pots. Alaska pots also use far less twine, and have escape mesh and escape rings.“Those function at all times,” Donaldson explained. “That is intended to let out the small female crabs which cannot legally be landed.  So even when the pot is actively fishing, we’re promoting escapement of crab.”Donaldson said it’s tough to estimate how many derelict pots remain on any given sea floor. A British Columbia study estimated eight to 15% per year in some of their fisheries were lost or abandoned pots.Meanwhile, Alaska crabbers eagerly await word in a few weeks of the catch quotas for the red king and snow crab fisheries. The so-called ‘road map’ of the 2009 crab surveys is available now. It gives details about the abundance and distribution of crabs collected this summer at 360 test stations throughout the eastern Bering Sea.

Pacific fishery managers will decide in early April just how slim the pickings will be for West Coast salmon fishermen. Low salmon catches also are projected for British Columbia, and the supply of farmed salmon imports also will be down significantly. According to market analyst Ken Talley, production of farmed Atlantic salmon from Chile, the No. 1 importer to the Unites States, could fall 25-50 percent. That’s due primarily to a deadly virus that has plagued Chilean fish pens for more than a year.Meanwhile, Alaska’s 2009 salmon harvest is projected to increase by 20 percent to 175 million fish. Much of the increase will be driven by lower-valued pinks and chums, which have taken on new importance in the marketplace in today’s tough economy.The wholesale market for Alaska salmon was very strong last year, due to reduced volume. The statewide catch topped 709 million pounds, down nearly 34 percent from the previous year. Alaska processors put up almost 288 million pounds of fresh and frozen salmon products last year, a drop of 22 percent from 2007.The total ex-vessel value (dockside) of Alaska’s salmon catch gained only 1.8 percent last year. But the average ex-vessel price jumped almost 32 percent from 2007, Talley said, to 58 cents a pound, the highest value in recent memoryFishermen got higher prices for every species last year, except for sockeye salmon. Average Chinook prices increased from $3.07 per pound in 2007 to $4.28 a pound. Cohos jumped from 96 cents to $1.21. Chum prices to fishermen increased from 34 cents per pound to 53 cents, and pink salmon went up a dime to average 29 cents a pound. Sockeye salmon dropped from 80 cents a pound in 2007 to 78 cents last year.Even though wild Alaska salmon will be more important than ever to the market this summer, the key will be the willingness of consumers to pay for higher priced foods. The consumer price index shows that food prices increased nearly 5 percent in February from the previous year, with seafood prices jumping more than 7 percent.Fish is top cropDon’t ever refer to it as farming – but homegrown fish are Alaska’s largest agricultural crop. Call it  “ocean ranching” instead.Whereas farmed fish are grown in closed pens or cages until they’re ready for market, Alaska fish (mostly salmon) are grown in hatcheries until they are released as tiny fingerlings to the sea. When the fish return to the “ranch,” they make up a huge part of Alaska’s total salmon harvest.Most of the fish are raised at 36 fish hatcheries, primarily privately owned nonprofits, with a few owned by the state or the feds. (The state oversees them all.) The hatcheries raise a mix of five species of Pacific salmon for commercial and sport catches.The state’s annual report on its salmon enhancement programs shows that nearly 1.5 billion baby salmon were released to the ocean last year, while 60 million returned to their home hatcheries. Those fish accounted for 34 percent of Alaska’s total salmon catch last year. The hatchery fish were worth $110 million to fishermen, accounting for 29 percent of the total harvest value.Chums by far make up the biggest hatchery crop at 64 percent of the state’s total catch. It’s 44 percent for pinks, 21 percent for coho salmon, 20 percent for kings  catch is and 3 percent of Alaska’s sockeye catch are from hatcheries.In some regions, ranched salmon by far make up most of the total harvest – 91 percent at Prince William Sound, worth 83 percent of the value, and 24 percent of the catch for Southeast, worth 41 percent of the value. At Cook Inlet, four percent of the salmon catch and value comes from local hatcheries; at Kodiak, hatchery fish comprise nine percent of the Island’s poundage harvest, worth 15 percent of the value. Find the 2008 salmon hatchery report at www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us.Herring hitsAmid little fanfare, Alaska’s most lucrative herring fishery got underway at Sitka Sound last Sunday when seiners scooped up 2,700 tons in a 15 minute opener. On Tuesday they took another 5,000 tons in an hour and a half. That brought the catch to a little over half of the 14,500 ton catch quota.<COL>The salmon story<COL>2009-04-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/10/southeast-alaska-is-swimming-in-sea-otters/<COL>Southeast Alaska is swimming in sea ottersBy Laine WelchThreatened sea otters in Southwest Alaska received more protection last week in hopes it will help boost a rebound of their dwindling numbers. There were more than 100,000 sea otters in Southwest waters in the 1970s, but fewer than 40,000 now. Some areas have seen numbers plummet 90 percent.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated nearly 6,000 square miles as “critical habitat” in nearshore waters of the Alaska Peninsula, Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea. Areas close to shore provide most of the shellfish that otters eat; the shallow waters also protect the sea otters from killer whales – a suspected culprit in their demise. The USFWS said the designation should not cause any fishing closures.It’s a far different dilemma in Southeast Alaska, where sea otters are booming.“Sea otters have one of the most rapid reproductive rates in the mammalian kingdom. They are able to reproduce at any time of the year, and they have a population doubling time of about five years,” said Nathan Soboleff, who tracks and tags sea otters for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Marine Mammal Office in Juneau.Current estimates peg the Southeast sea otter population at roughly 10,500; but that’s based on surveys that are over five years old.As an Alaska Native, Soboleff can also hunt sea otters – one of the few ways to keep the animals in check. Since a USFWS tracking program began in 1989, a total of 14,078 sea otters have been tagged and harvested statewide, Soboleff said.In Southeast Alaska, the sea otters pose a growing threat to several important fisheries; notably, Dungeness crab. However, Soboleff said Native hunting is dropping off considerably.USFWS data show that Alaska Natives took 704 sea otters statewide in 2007; 633 animals were taken in 2008, and 471 were hunted as of mid-August this year.“Traditionally, people went out commercial fishing and they would do a lot of harvesting while they were out there,” Soboleff explained. “Now, with so many fishing permits gone and economies hurting, people aren’t making these long-distance treks to harvest marine mammals and other subsistence resources because it is prohibitively expensive. So, you’re seeing less harvest occur when – in the case of sea otters – we should probably be increasing it.”Soboleff said a stall in tourism also has cut into the demand for sea otter handicrafts.“Now, with the state of the world economy, the tourism industry has apparently reached its peak within the Southeast region and may start declining,” Soboleff said. “So you’ll find the push for harvesting sea otters may begin to slow down even more, which would be really bad for commercial fishermen.”“The sea otter is one of the few animals, along with humans, that will go in and fully exploit resources and use them all up without any concern for the ecosystem of management of an area,” he added.Meanwhile, all signs indicate that sea otters are expanding their range throughout the Panhandle. Soboleff believes working with Alaska Natives to help manage sea otters and other wildlife has promising potential.“They are a group that should not be overlooked in dealing with this dilemma of the interaction of commercial fisheries and sea otters,” Soboleff said.About 90 percent of the world’s sea otters live in Alaska waters. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct an extensive sea otter survey throughout Southeast Alaska next year.Fishermen’s input wantedThe new project that aims to compile labor data on deckhands is on track to go before the Alaska legislature in January. There is virtually no economic data on that Alaska workforce of roughly 20,000 self-employed fishermen.“The people who work as crew members on fishing boats are probably one of the only groups of laborers in Alaska that is not counted in some way by the state,” said Project Director Jan Conitz with the ADF&G commercial fisheries division in Juneau. “It’s long overdue.”What is needed now is more input from fishermen, Conitz said, as the contractor (Wostmann & Associates of Juneau) aims to wrap up interviews with agencies and stakeholders this month.“The purpose of the interviews is to gather information on things like typical practices in fisheries, how people would use the data, what would be the most convenient way for people to report the data, what kind of technology people are using on their boats; things like that,” Conitz said.Three options are being analyzed for the data collection. One would use existing electronic landing reports or fish tickets; the others would require skippers to keep logbooks on all deckhands.The labor data collection program will need a nod from Alaska lawmakers.“What we need is specific legislation requiring that data about crew members is reported. Currently, it doesn’t have to be and it isn’t done,” Conitz explained. “And if you have a reporting requirement about data for people, then you have to make sure that the individual confidentiality is protected.”She estimates the price tag to maintain the program around $250,000. If approved, labor data will be collected from deckhands in every Alaska fishery starting in 2011. Conitz urges fishermen to provide input now, while the program is being developed.“It’s high time that this important sector of the industry gets counted and gets credited for what they do,” she said.Contact Jan Conitz at 907-465-4125 or   jan.conitz@alaska.govListen live!Can’t make it to Anchorage for fish meetings?

But these ‘one bys’ really add up,” said Jerry Dzugan, director of the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association.Simply wearing a personal flotation device (PFD) could save countless lives, but sadly, fishermen resist using them. Safety advocates are trying to change that by having the fishermen field test new models.“Since 1990 there have been 83 commercial fishermen in Alaska who have died from falls overboard. Many were in minutes of being rescued when they lost strength and drowned. In those cases, it very clearly could have been prevented with a PFD,” said Devon Lucas, an epidemiologist for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Anchorage.Lucas is leading a study to find out why fishermen forego PFDs and how to improve the life saving devices.“A lot of fishermen tell us that they are bulky, hot, heavy and too uncomfortable to work in,” Lucas said. “We started wondering if the newer models, that are inflatable or integrated into rain gear, would face the same kinds of problems that the older, bulkier foam PFDs did.”The study aims to get feedback on six new PFDs by having fishermen wear them for a month while they fish on various vessels.“We know that the different seasons and weather conditions and the type of gear they are operating will probably make fishermen have different preferences,” Lucas said. “Afterward, they will rate the PFDs on how bulky they are, too tight, if they constrict motion, get snagged in gear, how easy to put on, keep clean, those kinds of things.”Bering Sea crabbers and trawlers have so far participated in the PFD study, and the NIOSH team will be walking the Kodiak docks this week looking for volunteer longliners. In June they will target the Bristol Bay gillnet fleet, Lucas said.He added that the response by fishermen has been very welcoming.“This is an issue that fishermen are concerned about and they are ready and willing to look at new ways to solve the problem,” he said. “They especially like the fact that we are asking them to provide their input, rather than just assuming what they might like, and testing PFDs with some other groups who aren’t dealing with the same conditions.”PFD questions?

Every two years, the state accepts applications for aquatic farm sites from January through April. Currently, 66 farms have permits (not all are active), dotting Southeast and Southcentral waters. Oysters are the main crop, valued at about a half million dollars each year.“Alaska doesn’t come close to meeting the demand for oysters, both in state and Outside,” said Cynthia Pring-Ham, mariculture coordinator for ADF&G.The economic downturn has increased interest in mariculture and several training programs are helping people get started. The state offers more than 20 pre-approved sites for farmers, or they can opt for their own underwater acreage.Alaska has been very supportive of the fledgling mariculture industry. There are now shellfish hatcheries at Seward and Prince  of Wales Island, the Kachemak Shellfish Growers Cooperative in Homer has a big new facility and the Oceans Alaska center in Ketchikan aims to be a global leader in aquatic farming. Project director John Sund says it’s all about jobs.“Economic development is the primary thing,” Sund said. “If we look at what the opportunities are for year round, sustainable jobs in remote coastal communities, the shellfish industry is one of the best options we have.”Economists have estimated that farming geoduck clams, sea cucumber, scallops and seaweeds could return up to $100 million to Southeast Alaska, compared to $7 million today.Pring-Ham said she doesn’t know why there is no interest in mariculture from Western Alaskans.“It might be due to a lack of awareness about the opportunity. A lack of funds has cut into our ability to create awareness and do more training,” she said. Pring-Ham agreed that local CDQ groups might fund the launch of a lucrative aquatic farm industry in their regions.Deadline to apply for aquatic farm sites is April 30.

Anglo American is the developer behind the proposed Pebble Mine in Southwest Alaska. Mining companies claim that the region holds some of the largest deposits of gold and copper in North America. The Pebble Project would provide badly needed jobs for hundreds of people. However, it is located at the headwaters of the world’s most productive sockeye salmon fishery at Bristol Bay.The AK2UK group of seven aims to convince the mining company that most of the region’s residents oppose the mine, said Bobby Andrew, a spokesman of Nunamta Aulukestai (Caretakers of the Land).“We did an opinion survey of nearly 35 villages last March, and 70 percent opposed the Pebble Project,” Andrew said. “Surprisingly, 70 percent of the villages in the Iliamna region said they were opposed. That’s kind of interesting because you sometimes get the sense that area supports the mine, but the survey says differently.”In visits to Alaska last year, Anglo American CEO Cynthia Carroll stated about the Pebble Mine: “If the people don’t want it, then they are not going to do it.”U.K. media and the Royal Family are invited to the London premiere of “Red Gold,” an award winning documentary about how the Pebble Mine would change people’s lives.

Nearly 400,000 volunteers scoured 33,000 miles of shoreline in 76 countries and in 45 U.S. states.In all, they picked up 6 million pounds of trash in one day from world beaches, averaging 182 pounds of trash for every mile of shoreline. But the volume of the trash tells only part of the story. It’s the items collected that show how ocean-goers have a general carelessness about what and where they toss their trash.To document what is being dumped, the Conservancy cataloged all the trash into more than 7 million items. Fifty seven percent of the trash (2 million items) was related to food wrappings and beverage containers, also cups, plates and plastic eating utensils; plus 1.2 million bottles and beverage cans. Thirty three percent of the ocean trash came from smokers. Beachcombers collected 2.3 million cigarette butts, filters and cigar tips, along with balloon bits and strings, tires, wires and building materials. Offshore divers also collected 160,000 pounds of similar debris. Just over 6 percent of the trash collected came from fishing gear or other “waterway activities.”Ocean debris in Alaska differs from other places, where 60 percent  comes from land-based sources, like beach litter or urban storm drains, and 30 percent (again) cigarette butts and other smoking related trash. Alaska debris is mostly fishing related – but not necessarily from Alaska fishing operations. Many of the nets picked up are scraps from old high seas drift nets and trawl nets used long ago by foreign vessels in the Bering Sea. There also are currents that bring over a lot of fishing debris from Asia.Marine debris clean-up efforts reached a milestone in Alaska this year with more than 1 million pounds removed from the coastline. That’s equivalent to filling four 747 cargo planes with beach trash. Since 2003, the Juneau-based Marine Conservation Alliance Foundation has organized more than a dozen clean-ups from the Panhandle to points far west.One of the MCA Foundation’s biggest projects was removing 100,000 pounds of trash off of St. Lawrence Island and 20,000 pounds off of Golovin, with crews from Gambell and Savoonga.There are some good signs that the tide may be turning on trash. Nearly 80 percent of those surveyed in a recent Gallup Poll said they have made lifestyle changes to protect the environment.AK2UK updateAlaskans met last week in London with directors of Anglo American – the developers of the Pebble Mine. The mine, located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, would be the largest open-pit gold and copper mine in North America.The so-called AK2UK group, which includes seven Native leaders and Bristol Bay sport and commercial fishermen, told the mining decision-makers that they “have not heard the message that most Alaskans oppose the Pebble Mine.”The group believes they did get that message across, said Bobby Andrew of Nunamta Aulukestai (Caretakers of the Land).Thomas Tilden, a Bristol  Bay village spokesman, said that he didn’t hear anything encouraging from Anglo American officials “except that Pebble permits are being put off for another year.”Tilden called the mining mega-corporation a “heartless soul’ when it comes to dealing with human issues.“As a board  member, I know when I’m being pacified, and that’s how I felt.”Lydia Olympic said the meeting went well, but the Pebble backers keep saying “let’s all work together.” Olympic said that is not something most Alaskans are willing to do.If the mine is developed, six major UK jewelers representing 260 stores announced they will not buy gold from Pebble. They join eight U.S. retailers who made the same pledge last year. Globally, jewelry accounts for about 68 percent of gold demand; 80 percent in the U.S.One of the strongest supporters of the No Dirty Gold campaign is world-famous Tiffany’s. The Alaska group met with Tiffany’s vice president, who proudly donned an ivory salmon carved by Everett Thompson of Naknek.“This could cost them millions, or they could gain much more in return. But they were willing and happy to do it. I was very, very impressed by Tiffany’s,” said Bobby Andrew.The Alaska group said there is a lot of media interest in the Pebble Mine story. The UK is the No. 1 buyer of canned sockeye salmon, primarily from Bristol Bay.

In fact, it was fish, primarily the state/federal fight for control of salmon, which spawned the push to statehood.At a seafood extravaganza on Thursday, fisheries historian Bob King will provide a lively 50-year overview of the industry. The nation’s largest fishing trade group – United Fishermen of Alaska – will reveal its first Hall of Fame list.UFA director Mark Vinsel said the group modeled its selection process after the baseball hall of fame.“We had a list of nearly 60 names submitted. So we compiled a nomination list and then voted. We ended up picking the top 20 vote-getters. It’s a remarkable list,” Vinsel said. UFA will continue adding names each year to the seafood industry Hall of Fame, he added.UFA also voted unanimously to present a lifetime achievement award to Senator Ted Stevens, who plans to attend the commemorative dinner.“Without his work, it’s hard to imagine that our fisheries would even exist, and that the U.S. and especially Alaska, would be a leader in sustainable fisheries,” Vinsel said.The 50th anniversary seafood celebration – which kicks off the annual Comfish trade show – is set for tomorrow at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Kodiak.

Fishery advocates will urge him to reinstate a ban on offshore oil and gas sites that are smack dab in the middle of some of the world’s richest fishing grounds – Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering Sea.“This is the start of a very important education process with the new presidential administration, and there is a lot of work to do in conveying the importance of Alaska’s fisheries,” said Kelley Harrell, director of Friends of Bristol Bay.Before leaving office, President Bush pulled protections that, for more than 30 years, had kept energy development off limits in the region’s waters; home to the world’s largest salmon runs, as well as Alaska pollock, crab, herring and halibut fisheries. The area is dubbed the nation’s “fish basket” because it provides 40 percent of the total U.S. fish catch. Currently, a six-million acre parcel, including the prime fishing grounds, is set for lease sales to oil and gas developers in 2011.“There is such a direct overlap with the area proposed for leasing and marine habitat and fishing grounds – you couldn’t design a worse place for drilling in terms of Alaska’s fisheries,” Harrell said.The importance of the region’s fisheries was overlooked in a report on offshore energy potential released last week by the U.S. Geological and Minerals Management Services, said Celeste Novak of the Alaska Marine Conservation Council.“The report is fairly nebulous in terms of what the resource actually is in Bristol Bay, and what we could potentially lose were they to do oil and gas drilling,” she said. AMCC will testify at the hearing to fill in those “fishery gaps,” Novak added.“For example, just one percent of the oil and two percent of the natural gas that this whole nation has to offer would come out of that area, compared to a multi-billion dollar sustainable, natural resource,” Novak added.Fishermen want Secy. Salazar to know that eco-risks extend well beyond drills and spills, said Dan Strickland, AMCC fisheries coordinator for Bristol  Bay.“There’s the seismic testing, all the supporting infrastructure, onshore pipelines, underwater pipelines, huge docks and the associated tanker traffic,” Strickland said.He acknowledged that oil and gas development would provide jobs, and some believe that the two industries can safely co-exist.“I believe there are alternative methods we can use that address jobs and energy needs besides oil and gas development in that area.”The Interior Department hearing on offshore oil/ and gas development takes place April 14, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Dena’ina Convention Center in Anchorage. Anyone can sign up at the door to testify – or register in advance at DOI_Events@ios.doi.gov/Get more info at www.akmarine.orgHalibut has slow startHorrible weather has kept most of Alaska’s halibut fleet from pounding the grounds since the fishery opened March 21st. By Friday, only 127 landings had been made, and the catch barely topped one million pounds, compared to more then 3 million pounds last year.The low volume pushed up prices paid to fishermen to far better than expected. The economic crunch, combined with lots of holdover halibut in freezers, has hit the market hard. Rumors prior to the fishery pegged starting prices at between $2.25 – $3.50/lb, compared to over $5 in recent years.  But the first fresh halibut of the season always fetches the highest prices and this year is no exception.At Homer, prices started at $3.60-$3.80 for a few small loads. Kodiak buyers were paying 3.00 – $3.30/lb, with few fish being delivered. In Southeast, halibut starting prices were called ‘shockingly high’ at $3.40 to $3.50/lb.As soon as larger volumes start crossing the docks, prices will inevitably head downward. Alaska buyers said it’s tough to get a real feel for the halibut market with so few fish coming in. Markets are interested, they said, but being really careful. No one is going to pay a huge price for halibut, and then get stuck holding it, especially when there is still so much fish in the freezers – halibut they bought for more than $5/lb last year before the U.S. economy really tanked. At “10th and M Seafoods” in Anchorage, fresh halibut fillets were retailing for $12.95/lb. Frozen fillets at Costco were selling for 8.99/lb, compared to $15.99 last year.Seawater washes exhaustThe shipping industry, like the airline industry, is responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but it has been hard to regulate because standards need to be approved and enforced globally. Now sea water might be the solution.Eco-Geek reports that a Singapore company called Ecospec has developed a method to remove carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur and soot from ship exhausts with seawater. The process, called CSNOX, uses electrolysis and ultra-low frequency waves to raise the alkalinity of sea water to a pH of 10 up from 8.1. The sea water is pumped into a tank, and then sprayed into the exhaust funnel of the ship. The dirty water is then collected, filtered and processed before being returned to the ocean. The higher alkaline water is actually to the ocean’s benefit, since the acidity of the world’s oceans has been rising as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises.Ecospec’s main objective was to create a process that did not use chemicals or create secondary environmental issues. The company said the method has been tested on a tanker and was shown to remove 75 percent of CO2 from the exhaust and up to 90 percent of other harmful emissions. The results earned them the support of the American Bureau of Shipping.If the process makes it past the testing phase, it would cost $500,000 to $1 million to fit most ships with the sea water system.“A small price to pay for removing the cause of four percent of global fossil fuel emissions,” the Eco-Geek article said.<COL>Crude and fish don’t mix<COL>2009-04-08<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/11/economic-trends-publication-answers-key-indicator-questions/<COL>Economic Trends publication answers key indicator questionsby Laine WelchWhat is the average age of Alaska deckhands and where do they all live?Find the answers in this month’s issue of Alaska Economic Trends by the State Department of Labor, which highlights “Employment in Alaska’s Seafood Industry.”Here’s a sampler:  Fish-harvesting jobs in Alaska have shown two distinct trends over the past nine years. From 2000 to 2002, employment numbers fell dramatically; then through 2008, fishing jobs stabilized and recovered a bit. Over the entire period, harvesting employment lost 1,436 jobs; a 16.5 percent decrease.When fish harvesters are combined with processing workers, 52,000 people were directly employed in the seafood industry in 2008. A breakdown by age groups shows that 47 percent of Alaska deckhands were 29 or younger. Permit-holders were much older than their crew, with an average age of 46. Processing workers had an average age of 39.Forty six percent of Alaska’s crew members lived outside the state in 2008. Of the 54 percent who lived in Alaska, 82 percent lived in a coastal region and 18 percent lived in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Southeast was home to just over 14 percent of Alaska’s deckhands,  10.2 percent lived  in Southcentral, 5.9 percent in western Alaska, 5.4 percent in Bristol Bay, 4.9 percent in Kodiak and 3.1 perecent lived in the Aleutians/Pribilof region.For permit-holders, 21.1 percent resided in Southeast, 13.5 percent in western Alaska, 13.1 percent in Southcentral, 8.1 percent in Anchorage, 6.9 percent in Bristol Bay, 4.6 percent in Kodiak, 2 percent lived in Aleutians/Pribilof region.Twenty seven percent of Alaska permit-holders were nonresidents, and 74 percent of seafood processing workers lived outside the state.Alaska has been the nation’s top fishing state since 1975. More than 55 percent of total U.S. seafood landings come from Alaska, as well as 39 percent of the total value.“That’s pretty impressive for a state whose population amounts to only two-tenths of one percent of the nation’s total,” the report concluded.  Find the seafood employment report at  http://labor.alaska.gov/trends/nov09.pdfDangerCommercial fishing in Alaska is still the most dangerous job in the nation. According to the latest report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 126 Alaska fishermen died on the job from 2000 through 2008. That averages out to 14 fatalities a year – a rate that is 26 times greater than that of all U.S. workers.Fifty-three percent of the deaths were caused by a vessel disaster that required all hands to abandon ship. The second largest category – 27 percent – came from falls overboard. The remaining deaths were due to injuries on deck or onshore, and while driving.Most fishermen died in Alaska’s salmon fisheries, while cod and sole fisheries ranked second, followed by crab fisheries in the Bering Sea. In terms of region, more than three-quarters of the fishing fatalities occurred in the Southwest region of Alaska, which includes the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Bristol Bay.While the work-related death rate for Alaska fishermen is still too high, it has decreased 42 percent since the early 1990s. Twenty to 40 fishing vessels are still lost annually, and roughly 100 fishermen are rescued from Alaska waters each year.Find the report by Devin Lucas/NIOSH Anchorage at www.amsea.org.

(A trawl egg is an electronic sensor that tells the skipper when the net is full.) ?“That was very popular, but it was also a little destructive and we broke some stuff at the Qwest Center the first year,” Fraser said. “The management told us to take it outside.”The Fisherman of the Year contest takes place Saturday, Nov. 21 at 1 p.m. Find the lineup of events, workshops and conferences at www.pacificmarineexpo.com.Input wantedThe Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute has vacancies on several committees.

In mid-November, federal fishery scientists will unveil a draft biological opinion (BiOp) on proposed changes to existing rules for fishing fleets in portions of the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea.When Western Alaska stocks of Steller sea lions were listed as a threatened species in 1990, it forced widespread restrictions on where and when boats could fish. Fleets were displaced from three to up to 20 miles from haul outs, rookeries or other critical habitat for sea lions. By law, managers were required to craft a plan to aid in the animals’ recovery.The BiOp will incorporate all new research from the past five years, said Doug DeMaster, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Juneau.“Overall, the numbers from 2000 to 2008 show there is not a strong trend, and in fact, there is the appearance of a sea lion increase,” DeMaster said. “We’re waiting for the 2009 census data to make sure we’re interpreting that apparent increase correctly.” DeMaster said. Based on 2004-2005 data, the total population of western Steller sea lions in Alaska is estimated to be approximately 45,000 animals.“In terms of a BiOp, juvenile survival appears to be sufficiently high, as well as adult survival,” he added. “The factor that seems to be problematic right now is the reproductive rate of adult females at the age of sexual maturity. So it’s the reproductive side of the equation that seems to be preventing recovery.”Scientists are also factoring in the role killer whales play in preventing sea lion recovery.“I think most of us have thought for a long time that killer whales and predation is an important source of sea lion mortality,” DeMaster said.That theory gained more credence this month when a tagging study indicated that four out of five sea lions suffered sudden, traumatic deaths – most likely from killer whales. Since 2005, researchers at Oregon State University have partnered with the Alaska Sea Life Center in Seward to implant lifelong tags in the body cavities of 27 captured and released sea lions. The tags – developed by Wildlife Computers of Redmond, Wash. – record body temperature and other internal data.  Team leader Markus Horning said researchers can tell if a sea lion died suddenly by its internal temperature changes and by the tag’s immediate or delayed transmissions.Horning admitted that identifying the actual predators is a bit of guesswork, but said only a couple of species are known to prey on sea lions and are common in the region of Alaska where the five tags went off. He said in an OSU release that, “if the proportion of sea lions killed by predation in this study was applied to population models, more than half of the female Steller sea lions would be consumed by predators before they have a chance to reproduce.”Horning called the study a “wake-up call” for managers to begin looking more closely at the role of predation as a determinant in Steller sea lion populations.Meanwhile, DeMaster said there are basically four different possibilities that could be expressed in the draft BiOp as to whether or not fisheries adversely impact sea lions: no jeopardy and no adverse modification, jeopardy but no adverse modification, no jeopardy and adverse modification, or there could be both.The BiOp will be presented to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council in December. Any new fishing rules would go into effect March 2010.Fish bitsLots of good fish stories get lost in the daily news shuffle – here’s a sampler from last week:• Alaska salmon ranks as a “super-green” seafood on the popular Monterey Bay Aquarium list of best consumer choices. Alaska line-caught cod also made the list. The aquarium has distributed 32 million wallet-size Seafood Watch lists over 10 years.• Russia’s salmon haul this year was the biggest in 100 years, topping 550-thousand tons, or 1.2 billion pounds. Blame that for the price slash by half for pink salmon roe from Alaska.• The Pacific hake fishery has merited an OK by the international Marine Stewardship Council as a sustainably managed fishery. Hake, or whiting, has the most tonnage on the west coast and Canada; outside of Alaska.• Researchers at Duke University have unlocked the secret of barnacle “glue.” Amazingly, the glue binds together exactly the same way human blood does when it clots. The scientists hope more research might lead to a non-toxic solution for marine fouling, where barnacles stick to boat hulls creating drag.• The Irish Times reports that scientists are testing chitin extracts from crab and shrimp shells to treat obesity. Experiments show that chitin interferes with the uptake of fats into cells, and blocks the body’s hunger response. Ireland also is testing 500 local species of seaweeds for their untapped bioactive potential in weight loss and other health uses. In Japan, the seaweed – or “sea vegetable” –  industry is valued at $700 million a year.• Nippon Suisan, parent company of Unisea and Gortons Seafoods, plans to market fish oil made from orange roughy skins for use in moisturizing creams. The oil is said to have tremendous moisture retaining properties, and the company expects sales to cosmetic makers will top $3 million the first year.Fish fundsAmerican Seafoods Company is again accepting applications for its Alaska community grant program.

A fleet of more than 500 gillnetters were competing for the first catches of reds and kings, along with the usual media swirl surrounding the famous fish. Cordova was busier than ever, said Rochelle van den Broek, director of Cordova District Fishermen United, a regional trade group active since 1919. The “lower” fuel prices ($3.60 compared to over $5 last year) mean that more fishermen will be able to come back to town between openers.“They definitely looked more optimistic,” van den Broek said. “That will help business owners and people can spend time with their families. It really helps our community a lot.”The rush of media also keeps Cordova cash registers ringing. The Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association partnered with the Cordova Chamber of Commerce to bring PBS and National Geographic film crews to the world renowned fishery. As usual, news outlets covered the race from fishing grounds to high-end users in Seattle, all vying to be the first to menu the fish at their restaurants and retail counters. Alaska Airlines whisked 20,000 pounds of Copper River salmon to Seattle within 12 hours after capture; first reports showed retail prices at $29.99 per pound for kings; $19.99 per pound for reds.Prices to fishermen for their first catches were reported at $5.25 per pound for king salmon and $3.50 per pound for sockeye, a bump up from pre-opener posts of $5 and $3 per pound. (That compares to $6.55 per pound for kings and $4.55 per pound for sockeye last year.)The high prices are not a true reflection of the market place, and they will drop as more Alaska salmon fisheries come online.But there is no denying that Copper “Riverites” have created marketing magic for fish from their region, and they aim to expand their realm. Starting this season, ice is being barged to fishing boats in remote western reaches of Prince William Sound.“It’s a goal that our group has worked on for several years,”  said Beth Poole, director of the fishermen- funded CR/PWS Marketing Association. “And this past year we started working with processors in the region to actually get something on the water.”“Processors will bring out totes of ice and put it on the barge for tenders and fishermen to re-ice during openers and closures, and fishermen also can store their nets on the barge,” Poole said. The net storage will help fishermen swap out nets if they rip up, or when different mesh needs or fishery requirements demand it.The availability of storage and ice will save fishermen a five-hour run to port each way; 10 hours for tenders.“The western sound is really far away from any of the shore based ports in Cordova, Valdez and Whittier, so it’s not feasible for them to come back as often as they’d like to re-ice. Our goal is to get more ice out there to improve that point of harvest chilling that really improves quality,” Poole said.“Marketing is great and we will keep doing it, but if the fish aren’t top quality, all the marketing in the world won’t help,” she added. “Now we have an opportunity to boost quality and create a marketable niche for that region.”Fish counts: If forecasts hold true, good runs of pinks will boost Alaska’s total salmon catch to 175 million fish, a 20-percent increase from last year – and a 700-percent increase since 1959, the year Alaska became a state.For Chinook (king) salmon, the catch is pegged at 249,000, down 85,000 fish from last year. A statewide catch of 38 million sockeye (reds), a drop of one million. Managers predict 4.6 million coho salmon (silvers) will cross the Alaska docks, a slight increase; and chums – now often called keta salmon, should also see a slight bump to 18.5 million fish. For those hard to predict humpies, the catch is pegged at 113 million, a 34-percent jump from 2008.Fishermen got higher prices last year for every salmon species except sockeye. King salmon prices averaged $4.28 per pound, up from $3.07; cohos jumped a quarter to $1.21; pinks went up a dime to 29 cents a pound; sockeye salmon dropped to average 78 cents a pound, down from 80 cents last year. The value of Alaska’s 2008 salmon fishery was $409 million at the docks.Early markers so far show that the weak economy has taken a bite out of prices, at least for the higher value salmon. As noted, the Copper River prices were down significantly from last year. The first catches of spring kings from Southeast were fetching under $6 per pound compared to $7.50-$8.50 per pound.Halibut hitsHalibut landings continue to lag slightly behind last year’s pace, but the lower catches have not resulted in higher prices. Prices to fishermen have dropped around $1 per pound in major ports since the halibut fishery opened on March 21.At Kodiak, prices ranged from $2.50 for 10-20 pounders, $2.75 for 20-40s and $3 per pound for 40 ups. As usual, Homer prices were running 50 cents higher across the board because of that port’s ready access to the road system. In Southeast Alaska, halibut was fetching $2.60, $2.80 and $3.20 a pound.Market watcher Ken Talley of Seafood Trend said wholesale prices are $1 lower than last year – $5 per pound for fresh fish, and $4 at wholesale for frozen fish. Fresh halibut is selling at between $10-$11 a pound at many U.S. retail stores – that’s the case at 10th and M Seafoods in Anchorage, where halibut fillets are fetching $10.99 a pound, down from $16.99 last year.By last Friday 9.2 million pounds of halibut have crossed the Alaska docks, or 21 percent of the 43.5 million pound catch limit. Seward was in the lead for landings at 2 million pounds, with Homer close behind. Rounding out the top five ports were Kodiak, Juneau and Petersburg. The eight-month halibut fishery continues through mid-November.<COL>Salmon season looks good<COL>2009-05-20<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/05/time-for-decisions-on-forming-a-regional-seafood-group/<COL>Time for decisions on forming a regional seafood groupBy Laine WelchSalmon fishermen in Southeast Alaska are trying again to muster support for a Regional Seafood Development Association. RSDAs were approved by the state in 2004 as a way to help harvesters promote the distinctive attributes of their region’s seafoods, much like fine wine makers do with their varietal grapes. The unique RSDA concept allows fishing permit holders to vote to tax themselves, based on the value of their catch, and use the money for whatever projects they choose.The Southeast Alaska drift gillnet fleet will decide over the next few weeks if it wants to fund the start up of an RSDA, called Rainforest Wild.“Nearly 475 permit-holders will be voting on whether or not to assess themselves 1 percent to provide the seed money to get Rainforest Wild off the ground,” said Elizabeth Dubovsky, RSDA interim manager in Juneau.Two years ago, a vote to form an RSDA and include more than 60 Southeast fisheries was narrowly defeated. Now, fishermen are trying the vote on a smaller scale, hoping others will soon follow suit.“A lot of salmon gillnet permit-holders also fish for crab or shrimp; they wear many hats,” Dubovsky said. “There is definitely interest among the crabbers and some of the smaller fisheries in the region. They really have a lot to gain by having an organization pull in outside dollars and also help with marketing.”An even bigger opportunity is the way an RSDA can provide fishermen access to state and federal dollars.“It’s getting that seat at the table when it comes to handing out grants and other funding sources,” Dubovsky said. “And it is the first time that fishermen in Southeast would have a formal organization that could access federal and state grants.”The successes of the RSDAs in two other Alaska regions have not been lost on Southeast fishermen.“Folks started hearing about some of the infrastructure support in Bristol Bay where they are focusing a lot on ice and sort of ‘on-the-grounds’ development. And no one can deny the success Copper River has had in their regional branding and marketing,” Dubovsky said.The 541 drift gillnet permit-holders at Copper River/Prince William Sound, the first to form an RSDA in 2005, generate more than $200,000 each year from its 1-percent self-tax. The group has used the money for bicoastal advertising campaigns that go “beyond summer” and promote their fall coho salmon. Twenty-six CR/PWS setnetters recently voted to join the RSDA.Since 2006, Bristol Bay’s 1 percent tax on each of its 1,800 member driftnet fleet has generated more than $3 million for its RSDA. More than half the cash has gone into chilling projects throughout Bristol Bay, which returned a 10-cent per pound bonus to fishermen last year.“The overarching goal is to improve revenues for Bay fishermen. The fastest way to do that is through improved quality,” said BBRSDA spokesman Bob Waldrop. “Make the fish better, they’ll be worth more.”That’s the bottom line for Wrangell fisherman Keith Anundi, who has been behind Rainforest Wild from the get-go.“I’ve had fishermen say they are afraid that if they improve their quality at Bristol Bay, it will adversely affect our prices,” he said. “But I adamantly disagree with that, because the higher the bar is for all our salmon in Alaska, the better it’s going to be for all of us. I wouldn’t be involved if I didn’t believe this would substantially increase profitability for gillnet fishermen in Southeast Alaska.”A 1-percent tax on the Southeast fleet would yield an estimated $160,000 per year.“It’s a modest amount, but critical to getting the RSDA off the ground, to start projects and pursue more outside funding sources,” Dubovsky said.A newly elected board of directors will include representation from all Southeast regions, she added. A “last-chance” meeting on the Rainforest Wild RSDA is set for May 13 in Juneau. Deadline to return ballots is June 16.AK seafood in Times SquareAlaska seafood is appearing live on a sky-high, superscreen in the heart of New York City. The Times Square promotion, created by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, is timed to coincide with the start of salmon season.“It is Alaska salmon plunging up stream as the ‘wild, natural and sustainable’ Alaska Seafood logo gets larger and larger superimposed over the top,” said Laura Fleming, ASMI communications director. “It’s only five seconds, but that’s a lot of face time in video parlance. It appears three times every hour and will be seen by 1.5 million people each day for 77 days.”Fleming says the ultimate goal is to get more value from Alaska’s catch.“ASMI does not buy or sell seafood. All we can do is raise the value of Alaska’s harvest so that everyone gets more benefit,” Fleming said. “We get as many of our fish into that premium category as possible.”See the Times Square seafood billboard ad at www.alaskaseafood.orgNot to be outdoneSalmonChile is launching a $2.7 million marketing blitz to hold onto market share amid falling farmed fish crops due to disease, and increased competition from Norway. The “salmon from the end of the world” promotion, funded 65 percent with government money, will also study consumer perceptions about Chile’s fish farming industry.Fish tipA new book, “Enclosing the Fisheries: People, Places and Power,” features the community impacts of restricted fishing access programs around the world.Find Enclosing the Fisheries at www.alaskaseagrant.org/.<COL>Time for decisions on forming a regional seafood group<COL>2009-05-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/05/honoring-the-wounded/<COL>Honoring the woundedby Laine WelchSeveral hundred Wounded Warriors and their families will be treated to an Alaska seafood buffet and high-flying honors next month in Olympia, Washington.“We’re going to have about 300 soldiers with their families, and we’re going to give them some good Alaskan seafood. Then some war birds will do some static and a couple of fly-bys for the crowd, and World War II planes will fly in ‘missing man formation’ to honor the soldiers,” said Mark Kandianis of Kodiak Fish Company, who has almost single-handedly rallied the tribute.The Wounded Warrior seafood event, set for June 19, ties in with the annual air show sponsored by the Olympia Flight Museum. Kandianis said donations (tax deductible) of time, money and seafood are being volunteered by industry stakeholders and many others.Kandianis said he got the idea after spending time with friends who flew helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan.“I just thought it was a way to let these warriors know it’s a worthy cause and we’re still thinking of them and we haven’t forgotten them,” he said. “The TV coverage may have dwindled after the election, but these guys are still walking around with lost limbs and scars that reflect a lifetime of misery, and we want to let people know they didn’t do this for nothing.”It’s not the first time someone from Kodiak has rallied special recognition for the troops. For the past three years, dozens of wounded soldiers have been brought to the island for fishing trips, camping, four-wheeling and other outdoor recreations. Local businesses, residents and the Coast Guard have helped organize trips, and cover the costs for travel, hotel rooms, fish processing and other amenities. They also have made sure the soldiers were matched with special reels and gear for amputees, and boats with roomier sterns to accommodate wheelchairs. The Kenai River Sports Fishing Association has picked up the tab and purchased king stamps for the veterans visiting Kodiak.All of the wounded soldiers invited to next month’s Alaska seafood bash hail from the Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis.“Down the road, if we can raise enough money, it will go into the Madigan Foundation,” Kandianis said. The Madigan Foundation supports many veterans’ projects, including the Remote Warrior Care Program, which enables wounded or ill soldiers to be treated in their hometowns.“Without this funding, many of the wounded, injured and ill soldiers would not be able to afford the costs associated with their recuperating at home,” said WA Senator Patty Murray in a letter of support for the Foundation. Sen. Murray’s father is a decorated World War II veteran.While the Alaska seafood tribute will only last one day, Kandianis said the effects will be felt long after.“You know, the political mission goes on, but these are the guys who stand up and actually take it to them,” he said. “People talk about supporting the troops, and this is a way to actually show that we care about them and their sacrifice.”The Wounded Warrior Alaska seafood event is set for June 19 at the Washington State Patrol Aviation Section Hangar. Anyone donating $500 could win a flight in a restored 1942 World War II Navy trainer.Send contributions to the Wounded Warrior Event, Madigan Foundation, Box 97215, Lakewood, WA 98497. Questions?

That’s the lowest fatality rate since the government started tracking track those statistics in 1992. While improved safety standards get some of the credit, the decline in deaths was also due to job losses nationwide, especially in the construction and manufacturing industries.Commercial fishing continued to top the list of dangerous jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Census of Fatal Occupation Injuries report. Thirty-eight fishermen (112 out of 100,000 – down from 115 the previous year) died on the job last year, mostly off the coasts of Alaska and Maine. The “deadliest catch,” however, is the West Coast Dungeness crab fishery with 17 on-the-job deaths.Alaska has had the biggest improvement in fishing safety than any other place in the country. Fishing fatalities have plunged from nearly 40 per year in the early 1980s, to an average of 11 in recent years, according to the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association.Logging held on to the No. 2 spot for dangerous jobs, with 87 deaths per 100,000 employees. Rounding out the top five are aircraft pilots and flight engineers (67 deaths per 100,000); iron and steel workers (45 per 100,000); and farmers and ranchers (38 per 100,000).Fish FlashAlaska’s 2009 salmon season “officially” opens  tomorrow with the first opener for kings and reds at Copper River.

(The lowest price was 42 cents in 2001.) With bonuses for chilled and bled fish, this year’s final price for many fishermen could top $1.20 a pound.Fewer sockeyes all around has buyers scrambling for fish this summer, and the Alaska Wild brand is increasingly in demand by U.S. and foreign markets. Bristol Bay fishermen also got a boost from three more competitors that specialize in fresh salmon markets: Leader Creek, Snow Pac and Copper River Seafoods.Early estimates peg the value of the Bristol Bay sockeye fishery at roughly $170 million at the docks, an increase of more than $40 million from last year. The Bristol Bay sockeye salmon catch provides two-thirds of the total value of Alaska’s statewide, all species salmon harvest.tLandings testedTender vessels from Southeast to Western Alaska are field testing electronic reporting of all salmon deliveries this summer, called tLandings.“Most deliveries of salmon occur on board tenders, and that is where most fish tickets are completed,” said Gail Smith, electronic landings program coordinator for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. “It’s an ideal situation to do electronic reporting.”Between 600-700 tender vessels operate in Alaska each year.tLandings are the latest in a series of interagency reporting programs that include the state, federal government and the International Pacific Halibut Commission. eLandings have been used in Alaska since 2002, and are required in halibut, sablefish, Bering Sea crab and all groundfish fisheries.“tLandings for salmon is a voluntary program, and we never envision it will be mandatory,” Smith emphasized.In a “proof-of-concept” project this summer, 22 tenders are field testing a new application that computes the number of fish delivered, their weights, running totals of different species and then prints out a fish ticket and tally sheet. The tenders are operating at Bristol Bay, Kodiak, Sitka and the Kuskokwim region.All that is required is a laptop computer, an inexpensive laser printer, a magnetic strip reader for identification and a jump or zip drive that is provided for free by ADF&G.Tenders pick up a jump drive from their processor, which provides a list of all boats making deliveries. They plug it into their laptop and input the landing data. At the end of the trip, tenders simply return the jump drive to the processor, where the data is uploaded to their own systems and to Fish and Game.“It is simple to use and so much more accurate,” said Randy Swain, who handles computer operations for Alaska Pacific Seafoods in Kodiak. APS plans to expand tLandings to three tenders this summer.“The tender men are the only ones who input the data, the computer does all the math, and it turns out a nice printed fish ticket,” Swain explained. “It’s definitely the wave of the future.”“Our ultimate goal is to bring greater efficiency to the department and to the industry, because we very definitely see them as partners in electronic reporting,” Gail Smith said.Questions? Contact Smith in Juneau at   HYPERLINK “mailto:gail.smith@alaska.gov”gail.smith@alaska.gov .Profiling fishing townsSocial scientists with the Seattle-based Alaska Fisheries Science Center  are updating profiles of Alaska’s fishing communities and they want input from the people who live there.There are 136 Alaska communities officially designated as fishing towns.  Older profiles done in 2005 need to be updated to include 2010 census data and other new information, said AFSC’s Amber Himes.The Center is hosting Community Profile meetings in six Alaska fishing towns during August and September. The goal is invite local leaders and the public to help revise the profiles so they are more representative of the different communities, said Himes, a project coordinator.“We want to know how many people there are, what they fish for, what kind of fishing permits there are, and the kind of governance structures — such as tribal governments or city government — stuff like that,” Himes told KDLG.Some of the themes will include local stories that best illustrate the ways in which fishing shapes communities, information managers need to know that is not currently in the profiles, and how agencies can best work with communities to gather information.Himes said the Community Profiles are helpful for many groups and agencies.“They are used in social impact assessments for the North Pacific Council, by academics in research and federal and state managers,” Himes said. “When they have to do work in a community, they will go to the profiles as their first take on what’s happening. People have found it really useful.”The day-long meetings are set for Anchorage on Aug. 23, Dutch Harbor on Aug. 25, Bethel on Aug. 31, Nome on Sept. 10, Petersburg on Sept. 13 and Kodiak on Sept. 27.The meetings are co-sponsored by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council, Gulf of Alaska Coastal Communities Coalition, Southeast Conference and Southwest Alaska Municipal Conference.  Funding is available to help out with travel costs, on a first come, first served basis.

That has buyers scrambling to fill orders from eager customers, especially for scanty sockeye salmon. The demand has boosted early prices to levels not seen in two decades.Reports from Kodiak peg the average base sockeye price to fishermen at $1.49 a pound, up from $1.11 last year. (The base price does not include bonuses for iced fish, dock deliveries, etc.) Lots of boats had departed from disappointing sockeye catches at Copper River for more plentiful reds at Prince William Sound, where gillnetters were getting $2.25 a pound. Copper River sockeye prices were holding at $2 per pound, but catches there of 300,000 reds were down by half.Southeast Alaska gillnetters were also getting two bucks for their sockeye salmon, an increase of 75 cents a pound from last season.The talk on the dock for the world’s biggest sockeye salmon fishery at Bristol Bay has fishermen hoping to get close to $1 per pound, compared to 70 cents last year. Peter Pan and its fleet agreed on a base price of 95 cents for reds. Many are skeptical that the Bristol Bay sockeye harvest this summer will reach the projected 31 million fish.Market watcher Ken Talley said that vacuum-packed, frozen sockeye fillets from at least one major Alaska salmon processor is wholesaling for $7 per pound, compared to “the more normal” $5.50 per pound, and fresh sockeye “are now in the $9.50 per pound range.”Alaska wild salmon is so in demand that Western Alaska fishermen also are getting a better shake with fish prices. Kuskokwim sockeyes are fetching over $1 per pound, double last year. Kusko chums are averaging 25 cents, up a dime; and 70 cents for chums from the Yukon (called keta salmon), an increase of 20 cents.“Demand is strong for all our Yukon salmon and we’re having no trouble getting it to market,” said Jack Schultheis, manager of Kwik’Pak Fisheries at Emmonak.At Kodiak, chums were averaging 49 cents a pound, up 11 cents.   Southeast Alaska gillnetters were getting 65-70 cents for their chum salmon, compared to 51 cents in 2009.Alaska’s projected salmon catch for 2010 is 137 million fish, down 15 percent from last year.  The decrease stems from an expected shortfall in pink salmon returns. The 2009 Alaska salmon harvest was valued at $370 million at the docks; two-thirds of the total value each year comes from sockeye salmon.Halibut also highAlaska’s halibut fishery also is still in full swing, and prices have been high and holding since the season opened in March. The strong demand for fresh halibut is being called “remarkable” in the current economy. Less fish are available overall, and buyers are scrambling for product.Major Alaska ports are paying fishermen $5 per pound or more for halibut, depending on fish size. Lots of 10 to 20-pounders are being hauled in, while bigger fish are scarce. Prices at Homer (the nation’s top halibut port) reportedly reached $5.65 per pound for 60-ups last week.The strong fresh market is putting the squeeze on halibut that is heading for freezers, and that also is boosting fish prices. Even plentiful 10-20s are wholesaling frozen at $5.20 per pound, up $2 from last year.Alaska’s halibut fishery runs through mid-November and has a catch limit this year of just over 40 million pounds.Franken-fishComing soon to a store near you: Frankenfoods. After a decade of debate, last week the Food and Drug Administration officially proposed regulations that will allow genetically modified fish and animals on America’s dinner plates. Genetic engineering is already widely used in agriculture to produce higher-yielding or disease-resistant crops. But it will mark the first time that modified animals are OK’d for human consumption.First up for approval is an Atlantic salmon created at AquaBounty in Waltham, Mass. The fish contains a growth gene from a Chinook and an ocean pout, which produces growth hormones all year round. The result is a salmon that can grow to market size in 16-18 months instead of three years. That is likely to be followed by the “enviro-pig” which produces less phosphorous pollution in its poop.No matter how the critters are modified, you won’t know it. No labeling will be required that tells consumers that an animal has been genetically altered. The FDA may hold a public meeting to discuss the go ahead for the new “franken-fish” this fall.Robinson Crusoe updateFishing gear and supplies ranging from outboard motors to buoys, raincoats and radios were loaded aboard a container ship at Fishermen’s Terminal in Seattle on July 9, destined for Chile.In just four week, a diverse mix of North Pacific fishing groups, Bering Sea crabbers, trawlers and other stakeholders raised $85,000 in cash and gear to help restore the small boat lobster fishery at Robinson Crusoe Island. The fishery is the lifeblood of a community located 400 miles west of mainland Chile that was demolished by a tsunami in February.The loading party wrote notes on a special buoy and added it to the gear. Additional donations will provide materials for winches and net sheds that the Robinson Crusoe fishermen will build for their small boat lobster fleet.Questions?

Unfortunately, most of the money made in the seafood industry continues to flow Outside.While Alaska residents account for nearly two-thirds of the fishermen out on the water, Alaskans make up only about one-third of the seafood processing work force.    According to the new report “Seafood Industry in Alaska’s Economy by Northern Economics of Anchorage,” in 2006 nonresident seafood processing workers earned nearly $328 million – 82 percent – of the $400.2 million paid to that sector. About 56 percent of the $210 million paid to fishermen went to nonresidents.Data from the state Dept. of Labor show that nonresidents earn a greater share of the fish bucks because they hold more jobs in the lucrative pollock and crab fisheries, while Alaska harvesters are the vast majority in less lucrative or short term fisheries, such as salmon.The Aleutians and Pribilof Islands region accounted for 37 percent of the seafood industry’s dockside value in 2007; Southeast and South-central accounted for 21 and 20 percent, respectively; Kodiak at 13 percent, Bristol Bay at 8 percent and the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region had landings valued at just 1 percent.Seafood processing made up more than one-fifth of the annual average employment in Alaska’s “goods producing” sector in 2007, and accounted for almost 80 percent of all manufacturing employment. No other state has this level of industry concentration.Alaska seafood processing companies are aggressive about hiring Alaska residents, and the state Labor Department has a website dedicated to seafood industry jobs.   Alaskan workers tend to not apply for seafood processing jobs, however, preferring instead to work in the harvesting sector.The value of Alaska’s seafood industry has been steadily ticking upwards for the past five years, with total economic output in 2007 at nearly $6 billion. Alaska’s fisheries now account for 62 percent of all seafood harvested in the U.S.Capacity is okProcessors say they can handle this summer’s entire run of salmon at the world’s biggest sockeye fishery at Bristol Bay . That’s according to the annual processor capacity survey released by ADF&G.  Thirteen out of 15 processors responded, accounting for 98 percent of the salmon purchased last year. One buyer said they would not be in the Bay this summer; another was unsure.The 2009 forecast calls for a slightly lower harvest of 24 million sockeye salmon at Bristol Bay.  The 13 processors said they are able to purchase and process 30.7 million fish for the season, with daily capacity of 1.8 million salmon per day, or 100,000 more fish than last year. They also indicated a three percent increase in the Bay’s tender fleet capacity. 13 processors said they are million fishThe “in-Bristol Bay” tender fleet has a holding capacity of 36.4 million pounds, an increase of one million pounds compared to last year. The estimated capacity of the long haul tender fleet is 3.1 million pounds, and the season capacity is 16.6 million pounds.Still, many fishermen are skeptical about the processors’ ability to handle all the salmon. Last year the bulk of the red run arrived all at once and overwhelmed capacity. Processors imposed trip limits or stopped buying altogether, and frustrated fishermen watched three million catchable reds swim by their nets. A recent study from the Juneau-based McDowell Group found that 37 million fish worth $131 million to fishermen went unharvested in the past five years.“We have a consistent pattern in the Bay right at the peak of the run where it’s clear that there is a need out there for a little bit more processing right at the peak,” saidCora Crome, the Governor’s fisheries advisor, after last year’s fishery.Fishermen for years have been pushing for floating processors to be allowed into Bristol Bay to help handle any fish surplus. Crome said the State will work first with local processors to expand capacity, if necessary, and then look to other U.S. or foreign companies.Cheers for chumsSesame Teriyaki Keta Salmon by Trident Seafoods was the grand prize winner at the Symphony of Seafood bash last week at the Captain Cook hotel in Anchorage.  About 450 people showed up to sample and vote on all the entries, said Jim Browning, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, sponsor of the event.In all, 13 new items made their debut at the event, now in its 16th year of showcasing innovative Alaska seafood products.  Trident’s Teriyaki Keta also took top honors in the Food Service category; second prize went to a Lemon Butter Sole Buffet Kit by Ocean Beauty Seafoods; Smoked Scallops by Gerard and Dominique Seafoods of Woodinville, WA took home third place in that category.Trident also placed first in the retail category for its Thai Chile (chum) Salmon Fillets; Sweet Apple Salmon on a Cedar Plank by Hartley’s NW Seafood placed second, and Smart Salmon by Shining Ocean of Sumner, WA scored third.In the smoked category, first place went to Wild Alaska Pink Salmon Sides by Valdez Fisheries Development Association; second place went to Italian Style Salmon Sausage with Whiskey by Aqua Cuisine of Eagle, Idaho (which also won the People’s Choice award.) Smoked Salmon parfait by Gerard and Dominique Seafoods won third place in the smoked category.The Symphony winners will next head to the International Boston Seafood show in mid-March.“We provide them with booth space and enter the winning new products into the Boston contest.  They all get good representation at the largest seafood show in the U.S.,” Browning said.Big deal for byproductsScientists and industry stakeholders will gather this week in Portland, OR for a two day symposium called “A Sustainable Future: Fish Processing Byproducts.” (www.alaskaseagrant.org)  The work of five researchers from Kodiak’s Fish Tech Center is featured. The Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation will debut a short   ‘edu-tainment’ DVD on salmon byproducts, ranging from oils to boots and bikinis.

After all, that’s a primary goal: to rein in too many boats going after too few fish. Too often, rights to the fish get bought, sold or leased away from small, fishing dependent fishing towns.New England fishing communities are making sure that doesn’t happen to them as they transition to a catch-share program for groundfish next year. Bankrolled by $5 million from the federal government, “permit banks” are being set up to buy fishing permits for 19 groundfish species, and lease the catches to boats ported in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.The permit banks will be operated by each state or by private nonprofits. A permit may be worth between $150,000 and $400,000, depending on the number of pounds attached and the species.“Without a permit bank, there would be a handful of large boats fishing right off our communities that had no access to the resource right off their shores,” said Philip Conkling, president of the Island Institute in Rockland, Maine.The Institute and Nature Conservancy piloted the program two years ago. They lease poundage to fishermen who also test new net configurations.There are two important qualifications to access the permits: a boat must be 45 feet or less, and home-port in a town with fewer than 30,000 residents. That’s a lesson learned from Alaska, said the Institute’s Rob Snyder.“The need for permit banking came directly from our watching the halibut and sablefish fishery consolidate in Alaska, and how small boat communities tend to disproportionately lose out in these allocation battles,” Snyder said.Fishermen and coastal communities are encouraged by the permit bank opportunity, and hope it will anchor small boat fleets in their historical towns.“The fishermen who are hanging on and trying to stay in the fishery are incredibly encouraged,” Snyder said. “I think the folks who would like to get back in someday are holding their breath and hoping this works. But all in all, people are very enthusiastic in the small ports where this is happening.”Philip Conkling credited federal fishery managers for finally paying attention to the little guys.“This is the first time we’ve seen in New England that NOAA or anyone else in Washington has paid attention to it,” Conkling said. “For the past 20 years, the national dialogue has been all about scaling back and increasing efficiency in the fishing industry. There has never been any national level interest in trying to find equitable means when a fishery needs to be consolidated; to make sure the big fish don’t eat all the little fish. NOAA deserves a lot of credit in being very active in the community equity issue.”Alaska has tried to help small coastal towns hang on to shares of halibut and sablefish through a unique Community Quota Entity program, but there have been few takers.In 2004, the state gave the O.K. for 42 communities in Southeast and South central regions to form nonprofits called Community Quota Entities. The CQEs can purchase and lease shares of halibut and sablefish to local residents. To date, only one CQE has bought shares of halibut — 30,400 pounds by Old Harbor on Kodiak Island in 2009; none has purchased sablefish quota.A 2010 CQE report to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council said:“Due to the increased price of quota shares and other market realities, it has proven difficult to obtain financing in the absence of grant money.”Safety first“Sustainable” is a big buzz word in the seafood industry — especially for big corporate buyers. But it is not the biggest selling point for U.S. consumers.A survey done for SeaFood Business by the Perishables Group aimed to learn if messages about sustainability and eco-labels were resonating with buyers, and influencing their purchases. The answer? Not really.  Topmost on the minds of the 1,000 nationwide respondents was food safety, followed by price.Customers also look for wild or farmed identifiers and where their seafood comes from. About one-third claimed to be knowledgeable about seafood sustainability, while 40 percent said they knew nothing or very little about the concept.More than one-third believe farm-raised fish is more sustainable than wild-caught, and that farmed shrimp, catfish and tilapia are the best sustainable choices. Only 19 percent said they recalled seeing any type of label or message identifying seafood as sustainable in supermarkets. Conversely, 62 percent said they recall messages about wild or farmed fish at retail stores and restaurants. Over half of those surveyed said they eat some type of seafood at least every other week, with a third eating seafood weekly.<COL>Finding a way to share the catch<COL>2010-08-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/04/golden-anchor-gala/<COL>Golden Anchor GalaWhen it comes to taking pride in Alaska’s fisheries, differences are set aside.That proved true at a statehood anniversary celebration last Thursday in Kodiak that highlighted 50 years of Alaska’s seafood industry.A remarkable mix of roughly 225 people were lucky enough to get tickets to the event at the Golden Anchor on the U.S. Coast Guard base. It included a seafood smorgasbord, entertainment and a rare chance to rub elbows with special guests, Governor Sarah Palin and Senator Ted Stevens.Senator Stevens arrived early, looking spry and happy. He tirelessly posed for pictures and signed event programs, all the while shaking hands with friends and fans. Stevens was clearly in a “comfort zone;” he remarked several times “it’s so good to be home.”Governor Palin and Todd appeared right on time for dinner and (as with Ted Stevens) there was a buzz as soon as they entered the building. At first, the governor appeared a bit tense and uncertain, but there was a friendly vibe in the room and she soon visibly relaxed. Palin happily posed for pictures throughout the evening and spoke comfortably and casually with the throngs of mostly women who gathered around her.Fishing has always been part of Alaska’s history, said historian Bob King, who began the evening’s festivities. King authored a new booklet titled “Sustaining Alaska’s Fisheries: 50 Years of Statehood” at the request of ADF&G and given out at the dinner.“Some ridiculed the purchase of Alaska from Russia, but its biggest supporters were fishermen. They knew that “Seward’s ice box” was packed with salmon and cod and halibut. Canned salmon emerged as the first major industry in territorial days, and it dominated the economy like oil does today,” King told the packed house. “Salmon provided over 80 percent of tax revenues and the move to statehood was pushed by resentment of outside (federal) control of the industry.”Next to speak was Governor Palin who received a standing ovation as she went to the podium. Her remarks:“It is very fitting that we are here in Kodiak celebrating this – it being one of the most productive and beautiful fishing ports in all of our nation, and to remember just how far we’ve come – our shared passion for sustained fisheries, managed for abundance.”“We all are proud of our fishing heritage, which generates nearly $6 billion in economic output and accounts for over 50,000 jobs here.  There is no doubt that our commercial seafood industry is critically important to our state and these local economies  To many, this vital and vibrant industry is a way of life, but it is fitting to recall that we weren’t always so fortunate to have the thriving industry we have today.”“Looking back over 50 years – when delegates from around the state sat down to draft Alaska’s constitution, and at the time our salmon runs were at disaster levels and our offshore fisheries were being pillaged by foreign fleets and many of our our other fisheries had yet to be developed, it was with wisdom and foresight that drafters of Alaska’s constitution wrote our commitment to sustainability rights in our constitution. It was with frustration and a real independent spirit that Alaskans voted to ban the fish traps that were allowing outside companies to control our resources. Our constitution mandated this – and we live by this now – that fish would be utilized, developed and maintained on a sustained yield principle, and that has guided fisheries management from the beginning of Alaska statehood.”“Sustainability is not a fad or a marketing gimmick. It is a long held, heartfelt commitment to our resources and to our children and future generations who we want to pass on that sustainability that we have been absolutely blessed with.”“This long-term dedication to sustainability has resulted in Alaska’s ability to offer the world an abundance of  wild seafood which I believe is the cleanest, most natural, healthiest, most succulent in the world. It is the purest source of protein on God’s green earth, and everywhere I go, I try and make more Americans understand that.”“Fisheries decisions are some of the most controversial calls that we make as leaders. Fish politics just gets so bizarre. (Commissioner) Denby Lloyd and I talk about this all the time – the personalities involved, and because we are all so passionate about our fish, and all the gear groups and regions and some of the infighting and the battles, and we have to remember that at the end of the day it is because we love the industry and this resource, so people argue so passionately for each side.”“Sometimes it comes down to this when we talk with lawmakers regarding decisions or appointments that are going to be made to the boards that control our fisheries. Some will say, the governor is so pro comfish (commercial fisheries) – look, one of her kid’s names is Bristol after Bristol Bay. Denby has to remind them that I have another kid named Willow, after my favorite sport fishing grounds out in the Mat Su valley.  Just count the number of kids I have and you’ll know I’m all about abundance.”“I so appreciate Denby and his leadership – letting the biologists do their job. We committed when we first got elected to keep the politics out of these decisions and let the scientists do their job so we can have a vibrant, sustained industry. And in order for Alaska’s sustainable  fisheries to continue to thrive, they must be nourished by a commitment to sound science at every level, and that is starting at the governors’ office. The commitment to manage based on biology, not on politics, and the commitment to sustain a 50-year legacy of putting the long-term health of the resource above the short-term health of our wallets is what makes fisheries in Alaska special.”“To offer some personal aspects – my husband has been a commercial fisherman all his life – a drifter in Bristol Bay and now a setnetter on the Nushagak – and by the way, on that little trek we took across the nation when we did our campaign for VP  – it was so cool to get to talk about commercial fishing, and in the parts of America – they watch the ‘Deadliest Catch’ so they think that I’m one of those guys out there. I never really had time to explain that I’m a setnetter on the Nushagak, so I kind of left them with that impression perhaps. But, so be it.” (Lots of laughter)“It’s really cool to be a part of a commercial fishing family with such history as Todd’s family has. His grandma was a boat builder at Bristol Bay – back then fishing out of the sail boats for five cents a fish….To be a part of that, and to now be in a position to help make decisions that we believe will help future generations of Alaskans be able to capitalize on what it is that Todd and I have benefited from.”“Knowing that it takes a whole crew in this industry to make it work, I want to thank other crew members and that is the fine men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard who are on-call day and night to help our fishermen. Words really can’t adequately express my appreciation in all you do here in Alaska and in service to our country.”It was obvious that Gov. Palin really enjoys talking about fish – she exuded warmth and friendliness, and her overall demeanor was a throwback to the pre-VP campaign days when she could comfortably let down her guard. She closed with:“I am so happy to share fellowship and friendship with all of you – learning more about where we were, where we may go –the opportunity to share with you to celebrate with some of the hardest-working, most independent  residents in our great state, and that’s Alaska’s fishermen. I love you guys!”Next up was recognition of Alaska’s fishing Hall of Fame presented by Mark Vinsel, executive director of United Fishermen of Alaska.  Pioneer Al Burch, who has served on nearly every national and international panel over 30 years, brought down the house when he got teary-eyed thanking his wife of 50 years, Barb, as “the best fisherman’s wife in Alaska.”Former Senator and fisheries quota share advocate Clem Tillion said, “There’s no place I’d rather receive this award than Kodiak. When we were pushing quota shares for halibut they had a police escort for me when I came to town. Somebody said, ‘Does it bother you that so many people hate you?’ and I said, ‘Well, I hope my wife doesn’t, but the rest of you are quite immaterial.’”“When I served 20 years in Juneau, I made everyone understand that I will always vote on the side of the fish,” Tillion added. “I was here when we had nothing and by God, as long as we stick to putting the fish first, and we’ll fight and argue over who gets them later – we’ll be a healthy state.”Next, UFA President Joe Childers presented Senator Ted Stevens with a lifetime achievement award. Stevens took the stage to a resounding standing ovation – no boos, catcalls, or shoes thrown by critics, as some had feared.  It was Stevens’ first public appearance since his court case travesty and industry insiders said he wrote all of his own remarks for the Kodiak event.“Governor, I am delighted to be here with you – and you all should know that as I travel the south 48, you are the best public relations person we ever had,” Stevens said to laughter and wild applause. (Gov. Palin’s jaw dropped in pleased surprise.)“My mind went back to the state legislature. I met Oscar Dyson of Kodiak who came down to talk to legislators. I didn’t know much about commercial fishing, but he said the trouble is we have an industry that is dominated by salmon, but there has got to be a lot more fish out there that we can develop into a more diversified industry and economy.”“That was where I learned how to earmark money. (laughter) I earmarked $20,000 to start a study that looked at additional species to be harvested.”Stevens recalled how in January 1970, he flew to St. Paul and counted more than 90 foreign fishing vessels with accompanying catcher boats in nearby waters. At the time, foreign vessels could fish three miles and beyond from shore.“It lit up the sea like a small city,” he said, adding that the big boats each had a sort of huge ‘garbage disposal’ on deck to grind and dump all the unwanted fish.Stevens recounted how he worked with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to find ways to stop the pillage of foreign fishing fleets, and worked with the international community as well.“We had to extend our jurisdiction to 200 miles,” Stevens said.That finally came to pass in 1976 when Congress approved the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act.“There is no question that Alaska commercial fishermen drove that bill,” Stevens said. ”We led the world in extending jurisdiction 200 miles off the shores, and there is not a country in the world today that doesn’t claim the 200-mile limit. Alaska brought that about, and we did it not for the fishermen, but to sustain the reproductive capability of the fish species.”Sen. Stevens passed on a life lesson he learned when he flew to the Pribilof  Islands in 1970.“There were a bunch of presents for Russian Christmas when we landed at St. George, but no boats could get across to St. Paul. I told them to put the presents on our plane (an Albatross) but they said there was no airport there. I said hell, I landed C47s on roads in China, and you can land this thing on a road over there. The co-pilot refused to go   and I said I have a license and we went over and landed the first plane on St. Paul on that trip.”“That trip changed my life because I realized that if you really want to try, and if you are interested in something and devote your time to it, things will snowball and you can really build relationships and attain goals that you originally thought were impossible.”Seafood Hall of Fame – Bob Alverson, U.S. Senator Bob Bartlett, Bob Blake, the Brindle Family, Chuck Bundrant, Al Burch, Phil Daniel, Oscar Dyson, Sen.

He informed Governor Parnell personally late Thursday and then broke the news to me.“I planned for quite some time to retire at the end of this term, even before the DUI incident. But you can’t really announce something like that very early and still get good work done,” he said. “The timing seems right, and I also want to give time for the staff to get used to the idea, and for the constituents to decide who they might want next for commissioner.“And to be honest, the demands of a job like this take a toll, and I don’t know if I have the drive or desire to keep up this kind of pace,” Lloyd added.Denby Lloyd has held the commissioner’s seat since 2007. He is a 1985 UAF graduate with degrees in biology and economics. For more than 30 years he has worked in resource management in Alaska, three times within ADF&G.He shared these thoughts about the top job as Fish and Game commissioner.“Going to work every day, the most rewarding thing is workforce development,” he said. “We’ve got 1,700 hardworking and dedicated staff here and they are the ones who get things done. They need acknowledgement and reinforcement. We work hard on retention and recruitment issues and those are the things that really keep me going.   What I’d really like to able to do is give everyone a raise.”The toughest part of the job is dealing with attitudes, and trying to get out correct messages, Lloyd said.“People want messages fast, and communication speed is increasing,” he said. “But the types of issues we deal with are scientific or technically based, and they really do require some time and attention. Oftentimes, issues are condensed down by the media or in political debate into convenient sound bites, that don’t do the issues justice. That is really frustrating for our staff.”On issues:• State vs. federal management: “We need to stay vigilant in protecting the state’s prerogatives to manage fish and wildlife within and adjacent to our borders. In most cases, the state is more immediately attuned to the needs of resource users and to the resources themselves. The state can also move rapidly and more flexibly than the federal government in managing fishing seasons or hunting opportunities to assure conservation and sustained yield. The challenge internally is pursuing an aggressive and attentive course at the policy level, while maintaining close working relationships with staff in the federal agencies, so that research and management collaboration isn’t compromised.”Lloyd said the state acknowledges the need to protect certain animals, but has resisted the “escalating imposition” of the Endangered Species Act.“In many instances, federal listing decisions and recovery requirements have been based on very precautionary modeling parameters and extrapolations out to 50, 100, even 300 years,” Lloyd explained. “We think renewed focus needs to be applied to concepts such as imminent risk of extinction, foreseeable future and significant portions of a species range. There are a number of ways to manage the conservation of species without necessarily resorting to the heavy hand of the ESA.”Many were opposed to Lloyd’s selection as commissioner, fearing the “game” side of ADF&G might get less attention. Lloyd said relationships have improved over the past few years.“We have been able to strengthen and stabilize our intensive wildlife management programs, improve communications with wildlife user groups, and restructure the Division of Wildlife Conservation to better address region-specific concerns,” he said.• Big issues facing the department? Lloyd highlighted salmon hatchery vs. wild stocks, maintaining hunter and angler access to Alaska lands, subsistence preferences vs. increasing population, habitat protection vs. resource development, predator management, adapting to climate changes, technological advances and federal encroachment.“The single most important issue facing the department is the retention and recruitment of qualified, well-compensated staff,” Lloyd said. “I hope the various procedures, training, education opportunities and recruitment initiatives we’ve started will bear fruit.”• Changes to ADF&G that will outlast you?“I hope that a bit of culture change has occurred in the department that will better promote responsive and professional communications between our biologists and the public – to better assert state sovereign interests while maintaining productive relationships,” he said.For the North Pacific Council, where he has represented the state for almost four years, Lloyd said: “I really hope emphasis on the observer program, bycatch control, and coastal communities is maintained.”• So what’s next for Denby Lloyd?“I’m excited and looking forward to a new chapter in life. I’m hoping to get in some relaxation, then return home to Kodiak, regain some privacy and rekindle a sense of wonder.”Fish show and tellPolicymakers have a chance to learn firsthand about Alaska’s diverse fisheries — all gears, all regions — from Southeast to the Bering Sea. It’s part of an attempt by the United Fishermen of Alaska to teach rail-belters more about the State’s 130-year-old seafood industry. UFA is the nation’s largest fisheries trade organization with 37 member groups.“The seafood industry has become an invisible industry,” said Arni Thomson, UFA president. “But we are the largest private sector employer in Alaska and the direct economic benefits from the industry are rather staggering. Almost $4 billion of that seafood moves through the Anchorage corridor, and thousands of jobs are related to seafood and the transportation industry.”More than 60 percent of all seafood caught in the United States comes from Alaska. Seafood catching and processing puts more people to work in Alaska than oil and gas, mining, timber and tourism industries combined.As part of its annual meeting, UFA has invited mayors and legislators from Anchorage, the Mat-Su, Kenai and other regions to an afternoon of “fisheries show and tell.” That’s followed by a trip to the Copper River Seafoods processing plant in Anchorage and capped off with a seafood bash. Candidates for Alaska governor and U.S. Senate also are expected at the Sept. 28, invitation-only event at the Clarion Hotel.Killer cluesMore than 60 coastal Alaska residents have been trained to monitor and identify toxic algae in local waters. The toxin comes from a mix of tiny marine organisms that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in clams and some crabs.The training program is part of the Alaska Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring Partnership at the University of Alaska/Ketchikan.“The only way to do it realistically and affordably is to train people in these communities,” said Kate Sullivan a fisheries professor and AHAB co-founder. “So, we are trying to build capacity and understanding.”Several regions of Alaska have some of the highest PSP levels in the world. Yet, Sullivan says there is a lack of information to address the deadly problem.“People consume and harvest untested shellfish at a very significant rate,” Sullivan said. At one point, the Alaska Dept. of Epidemiology termed it “Alaskan Roulette.”AHAB detectives could be the ones to solve the PSP riddle in deepwater geoduck clams. The culprit could come from toxic cysts sharing the same sediment. For more information, contact Kate Sullivan at (907)-228-4565 or at kate.sullivan@uas.alaska.edu.<COL>Fish Commissioner Lloyd retires<COL>2010-09-22<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/10/%e2%80%98worked-up%e2%80%99-about-salmon-permits/<COL>‘Worked up’ about salmon permitsby Laine WelchA year ago, the depressed economy made it slow going for brokers who buy, sell and trade fishing permits. But that’s no longer the case. Higher salmon prices have driven up both demand and prices for salmon permits in most regions of the state.“This year has been much busier for us,” said Doug Bowen at Alaska Boats and Permits in Homer. “We’ve seen most of the benchmark permits up as high as they’ve been in the past 10-12 years, basically since the industry crashed when the farmed salmon came along.”“With a few exceptions in some areas, people are pretty worked up about salmon these days, and the permit market has been responding accordingly,” agreed Jeff Osborn at Dock Street Brokers in Seattle.Bristol Bay drift permits, for example, are selling for up to $132,000, compared to $74,000 a year ago. Another hot item is Prince William Sound seine permits.Seine permits “went insane” Bowen said, and practically doubled in value overnight to $150,000-$160,000. Dock Street has PWS seine permits listed as high as $195,000.Other examples:  Cook Inlet drift permits at $50,000; Southeast drifts at $66,000; a permit for Panhandle power troll fetches  $27,000-$37,000; and a Yukon gillnet permit is around $10,000.An exception to the upward trend is Kodiak, where lackluster salmon fisheries have seine permits stalled in the $30,000 range with little demand.Overall, the brokers said they are optimistic about the outlook for Alaska salmon.“Hopefully, we’ve turned a corner and wild salmon is finally getting the attention and respect it has always deserved,” Bowen said. “The product quality is way up, prices are up, and we’re all hoping for another great season next year.”Just as higher salmon prices have pushed up the value of permits, the same is holding true for quota shares of halibut, sablefish and Bering Sea crab.“The price for the product is the main driver and we are seeing the   highest prices ever for halibut and black cod,” Bowen said.Last year, the recession kept a downward press on fish prices, but they have rebounded to record levels. Halibut has topped $6.50 a pound at major ports; and over $7 a pound for large black cod.“We are back up to the same values we saw two years ago where some halibut shares are selling for $28 a pound,” Bowen said.Black cod (sablefish) shares have been trading at $22 per pound, and as high as $24 in Southeast and the Central Gulf; the low is $3 per pound in the Bering Sea. Bowen and Osborn said there is a lot of interest in quota shares for both fish, but they are pricey and hard to find.“If anyone is looking for any good deals on halibut or black cod quota, I’m not aware of any. It’s all expensive,” Bowen said.The same holds true for catch shares of Bering Sea crab.“Crab quota sales move in fits and starts depending on dock prices, but there is not much available,” Jeff Osborn said.Snow crab shares are priced around $10 per pound for vessel owners; and in the $25 range or higher for red king crab. Prices are lower for crew shares, Osborn said, and financing has not been a problem.“We went a long time without any interest from crew, but recently we have had more people looking for crew shares,” he said. “Availability is a bit of a problem.”The amount of catch shares now held by new entrant crew members is almost 12 percent for both red king crab and snow crab, according to federal data.The crab catch share plan in the Bering Sea is set for a five-year review by the North Pacific Council in December, and that has given pause to potential purchasers.“The uncertainty and concern seem to have waned a bit, but it is definitely in the back of people’s minds,” Osborn said.Shrimp assistAlaska shrimpers are now eligible for benefits to help them compete with the flood of foreign imports coming primarily from shrimp farms in Asia.“They have been impacted by the shrimp from foreign countries and it has reduced the prices they are getting for their product. So Alaska shrimpers are eligible to receive some assistance from the Dept. of Agriculture,” said Danny Consenstein, director of the USDA Farm Service Agency in Palmer.The Trade Adjustment Assistance funds stem from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The program provides cash and technical training; in this case, to help Alaska shrimpers better organize their businesses.The TAA benefits are not based on landings and everyone will be eligible for the same amounts of cash: $4,000 to develop a draft business plan, followed by $8,000 to implement a more detailed, long-term plan which can include marketing and promotions.Consenstein said eligibility for the TAA program is quite easy.           “You have to self-certify that you have fished shrimp in the year 2008, and then show you have fished in one of the prior three years,” he explained.Alaska has between 100-300 shrimpers, mostly in Southeast Alaska,  who fish with pots or beam trawls for spot prawns, coonstripe, sidestripe and pink shrimp.“I think it’s a great opportunity for them to make their business a lot more efficient, and devise a long-term business plan to be more successful in the future,” Consenstein said.Deadline to apply is Dec. 23.

Nearly 85 percent of Alaska’s seafood landings are caught in federal waters, meaning from three to 200 miles from shore.For Alaska pollock — which accounts for one-third of total U.S. fish landings — the Bering Sea catch could increase to 1.1 million metric tons, up from 813,000 metric tons. For pollock in the Gulf of Alaska, a catch of nearly 100,000 metric tons is an increase of 25 percent.Cod catches in both regions continue an upward trend; for the Bering Sea, cod is pegged at nearly 170,000 metric tons, up about 40,000.  For the Gulf, next year’s cod take of nearly 60,000 metric tons is an increase of 14,000 over the 2010 catch.Conversely, sablefish (black cod) numbers remain on a downward trend for both regions: for the Gulf, a recommended catch of 9,300 metric tons is down slightly, as is the Bering Sea catch of about 5,000 metric tons. Final catch limits will be decided by the North Pacific Management Council in December.<COL>‘Worked up’ about salmon permits<COL>2010-10-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/07/fishing-vessels-dodge-%e2%80%98hosing%e2%80%99-for-2-more-years/<COL>Fishing vessels dodge ‘hosing’ for 2 more yearsby Laine WelchFishermen and other boaters can rest easier knowing they won’t need a federal permit to hose off their decks. A bill that just passed the U.S. Senate extends the moratoria on discharge permit requirements for commercial and charter fishing vessels beyond the July 31 deadline.In 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency came out with regulations that would require discharges by vessels of any size to be reportable to the EPA under the Clean Water Act.Murkowski and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. succeeded in getting a two-year timeout for working boats and other vessels under 79 feet. At the same time, the EPA was given 15 months to study the types and effects of discharges from boats of varying sizes, and if the exemptions should be permanent. The study has not been completed, according to Sen. Murkowski.The measure to extend the moratoria passed the Senate unanimously, and Murkowski said it should be wrapped up before Congress adjourns for its August recess.Also moving through the lawmaking process is an $8 million Bering Sea crab loan program aimed at helping new entrants buy into the fisheries. It has taken five years for that loan opportunity to move up the “priority” of federal policy wonks.“The money is there and it must go out the door in the 2010 budget appropriations,” Murkowski said. “We are working aggressively to make that happen and the loan program should be finalized by this fall.”Murkowski spoke candidly about her “gut feelings” regarding the proposed Pebble Mine, and went beyond the typical response by politicians that “the project must be allowed to go through the process.”“My gut says we don’t balance one resource off another. It can’t be an either/or proposition,” she explained. “I do have concerns as to whether or not the project would impact the water, and therefore the salmon. I am not going to prejudge the project, but I put out the very precautionary note that you cannot trade one for the other.”Murkowski said she has had several conversations with Cynthia Carroll, the CEO of Anglo-American, developer of the Pebble Mine project.“She was very up-front in saying she also agrees that if they can’t do the mine in a manner that ensures the sustainability of the fisheries, then it is not a project that they would pursue,” Murkowski said. “I do believe they are studying this very carefully and intently, and we need to err on the side of caution when it comes to the extent of all the studies on the land, and in the watersheds and out in Bristol Bay.”Sitka launches first CSFBuying locally produced foods is a trend that’s taken off across the nation, and Sitka is making sure that applies to fish. This summer, a group of Sitkans launched Alaska’s first Community Supported Fisheries project which pre-sells shares of local catches directly to local customers. The fish is sold under the “Alaskan’s Own Seafood” brand, which claims to combine, “the best in business with the best in conservation.”The fish is pre-sold to “subscribers” in either 40-pound or 20-pound packs, said CSF program coordinator Beth Short.“Every other week, customers get something a little different. They’ve already had a halibut and black cod pick up, some ling cod and rock fish, and this time around it’s king salmon,”  Short said. “Then, later on in the season we’ll have coho.”The CSF started out small with 18 subscribers who paid $380 (plus tax) for 40-pound shares and $180 for 20 pounds.“That averaged out to be $9.50 per pound, which is really good,” Short said.All of the fish is delivered to Sitka Sound Seafoods, where set poundage is portioned, vacuum-packed and flash-frozen. That makes it easy for the two dozen participating fishermen, who get a price bump of about 25 cents a pound.Short said the CSF provides access to fish that most locals can’t get for themselves.“We have this bounty of seafood, but if you don’t have a boat or the inclination to fish, or you don’t know someone who can go out and get fish for you, your opportunities are very limited,” Short said. “I have always felt it was kind of strange and sad that it is so hard for locals to get a hold of seafood that comes from the waters right off their doorsteps.”The CSF is part of a larger mission by Sitka fishermen who are committed to sustainable fishing practices. It is part of the Fishery Conservation Network started by the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association, with funding by the North Pacific Fisheries Trust and Eco-Trust. Beth Short is hopeful the CSF will serve as a model for other Alaska fishing towns, and is eager to share information.

Weathervanes are the largest scallops in the world, with a shell diameter averaging 10 inches. Three to four boats target scallops by making repeated tows along mostly sandy bottoms of strictly defined fishing regions in a closely monitored fishery.“All boats must carry observers,” said Jim Stone, owner of two scallop boats which will remain at sea until Thanksgiving. “It’s a heavy cost of $350-$400 a day, but we accept that in order to go into the areas and make sure our bycatch and impact are minimal.”The yearly statewide harvest has remained steady at about 500,000 pounds of shucked meats, meaning the large adductor muscle that pulls the two shell halves together. Prices to fishermen vary widely by scallop size and market; the statewide average price last year was $8 per pound for a dockside value of $3.4 million.Stone is quick to credit state managers for the well-run fishery, and the Alaska Scallop Association he helped form 10 years ago.“The association acts as a co-op, and we work together to make sure we stay off bycatch and help each other target where the scallops are,” Stone explained. “And we divide the scallop quota among ourselves by our historic catch.”Jim and his wife Mona are also the biggest ambassadors for Alaska Weathervane scallops, cooking them up at festivals and other events throughout the Northwest. Their scallop/rice dish, as well as the scallop/bacon/pesto wraps recently won “Best of the Fest” at the Ballard Seafood Fest.“We are just educating the world that it is an entirely different animal than scallops from elsewhere,” Stone said. “Alaska scallops are caught, shucked, sorted, cleaned and frozen all within about four hours of capture.”Questions?

Just two areas, Bristol Bay and Prince William Sound, accounted for 55 percent of the value of the total Alaska catch.For the Bay, a catch of nearly 29 million sockeye salmon rang in at almost $149 million, an increase of $4.5 million over 2009. (That doesn’t include bonuses or other post-season adjustments.)Prince William Sound set a record with a total salmon catch of 75.4 million — nearly 45 percent of all salmon harvested in Alaska this year. And the PWS harvest of 69 million humpies accounted for 66 percent of Alaska’s total pink salmon catch.The statewide chum catch of 18.2 million is the eighth best since statehood; the value of nearly $93 million is the second highest since 1975.Here’s a look at average 2010  salmon prices paid to fishermen (per pound) with comparisons to last year: Chinook salmon: $3.44/$2.76;  sockeye: $1.11/90 cents;  coho: $1.05/$.93; pinks $.35/$.26; chum salmon: $.66/$.49.All Alaska regions, except for Kodiak and the Alaska Peninsula  saw nice increases in values for their salmon catches this year. Here are the 2010 dockside values per region (in millions of dollars), compared to 2009 – Southeast Alaska: $131.2/$111.5; Prince William Sound: $143/$54.3; Cook Inlet: $35/ $22.3;  Bristol Bay: $153/$146.2  Kodiak  $28/$39  Chignik $14.3/$9.8; Alaska Peninsula $22.7/$3; Kuskokwim $2.9/ $1.9;  Norton Sound: $1.2/$1  Kotzebue: $860,000/$376,000.Crab climbsAlaska king crab are also seeing some of the highest prices ever. Bering Sea crabbers dropped pots in mid-October with an advance price of $6.25 a pound, compared to $4.76 per pound last year.l price could top the record of $6.27 per pound set in 2002.Crabbers have delivered over half of the roughly 15 million pound red king crab quota at Bristol Bay.  By all accounts, the crab is looking good, although slightly smaller — 6 pounds, compared to the more normal 6.7-6.8 pound average.The bulk of the crab is going to Japan, meaning less crab for U.S. markets. Market expert Ken Talley said with the yen at around 82 to the dollar, Japan is willing to pay $14/lb. for Alaska king crab sections (including shipping costs) compared to $10 last year.The higher prices also have revived a new wave of king crab poaching from Russia’s Far East fishery, Talley said, adding some uncertainty to the supply picture heading into the holidays.One crab supply that is holding steady at U.S. retail counters is Dungeness.  Whole cooks are fetching a nice $4.99 per pound, and Talley said dungie sections should hit $6.50/lb.Fisheries in Washington, Oregon and California produce most of the nation’s Dungeness crab, with combined landings last year of almost 57 million pounds.  Dungie catches in Alaska total less than seven million pounds annually, mostly from Southeast with smaller fisheries around Kodiak. Dungeness crabbers are averaging about $1.90 per pound, similar to last year.Dining disconnectMore Americans say they want healthier choices at popular restaurants – but that doesn’t transfer to their food orders.That trend has held true in two national surveys by Chicago-based Technomic, Inc., which tracks eating trends for restaurants and food suppliers.  It reflects a disconnect between diners good intentions and their actions, said company vice-president Bob Goldin.“It’s the politically correct thing to say that you want healthier foods,” Goldin said. “But the chains tell us,  ‘Yeah, consumers say they want them, but when we add them to the menu, they don’t order them.”That was the response by 37 leading restaurant chains three years ago when Technomic tracked how attitudes toward health shaped customers’ buying behavior.  The company’s  2010  Healthy Eating Consumer Trend Report shows it still holds true today.Data from online menu tracking and surveys of 1,500 consumers showed that just 19 percent of U.S. diners feel that food described as “healthy” on the menu doesn’t taste as good as other options.Other findings: only 16 percent blamed the restaurant industry as being responsible for America’s obesity epidemic. Two out of five said they eat healthier at home than they do when dining out.By and large, there is growing demand for seafood, Goldin said. More consumers are aware of sustainability issues“The demand for social responsibility and environmental protections is growing, especially among younger consumers,” he explained. “But we don’t think at this point it’s really very well-defined.”<COL>Salmon bring high prices<COL>2010-11-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/12/fishermen-see-increase-in-prices-over-2009/<COL>Fishermen see increase in prices over 2009By Laine WelchAlaska salmon fishermen were paid an average of $.66 for each pound of fish they delivered this year, an increase of nearly 16 percent over 2009.That’s just one of the many interesting statistics in the post-season wrap up that provides a more complete picture of how the 2010 salmon season played out.This year’s statewide catch of nearly 169 million salmon was the 11th largest on record and although it was very close to the 2009 catch, all species saw substantially higher prices. The salmon also were bigger this year totaling almost 812 million pounds by volume, 9.7 percent heavier than last year.  That poundage was much more pricey – nearly $534 million at the docks (ex-vessel), an increase of more than 28 percent.It reflects the high demand for wild salmon, said Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley. This summer alone, wholesale salmon sales amounted to nearly $507 million, a “startling” increase of 30.5 percent over last summer, Talley said.In terms of prices paid to Alaska fishermen: For Chinook salmon, the average price went from $2.76 per pound in 2009 to $3.44 per pound, an increase of nearly 25 percent; coho salmon prices increased 13 percent, going from $.90 to $1.05 a pound; for sockeye, the average statewide price increased 23.3 percent from $.90 to $1.11. Chum salmon prices jumped to $.66 per pound, up nearly 35 percent. (The total value of the chum fishery — at nearly $93 million — is the highest value since 1975).The pink salmon average price of $.35 per pound also is an increase of 35 percent over last year.Yukon lampreysLampreys provide a quick payday for Yukon River fishermen each winter.  It’s a tricky fishery that depends on knowing exactly when the fish are under the ice.“When the run hits, you’d better be ready,” said Jack Schultheis, manager of Emmonak-based Kwik-Pak Fisheries, who helped launch the lamprey fishery seven years ago.  “It’s a day or two and they they’re gone,” he told KYUK.The lamprey fishery occurred two weeks ago, primarily from Russian Mission up river to the buying station at Grayling. Using dipnets through holes hacked in the ice, 25 fishermen raced to produce a catch of 24,000 pounds out of a 40,000 pound catch limit. They received $1.50 per pound for their catch.“That’s what’s always been a problem with getting the volume  all the stars have to line up properly to be successful volume-wise,” Schultheis said.Sea lampreys are among the oldest fishes on earth, estimated at 500 million years. Similar to hagfish, they are the only fish without jaws to survive in nature. Lampreys actually are parasites which attach themselves to other fish and live off their blood. Similar to salmon, sea  lampreys spawn in freshwater streams where they build gravel nests, then die after spawning.Lampreys were long prized in Mediterranean cuisine, but few fisheries remain anywhere today.“We’re one of the few open fisheries in the world for lamprey,” Schultheis said. “They are very susceptible to pollution so most of the big lamprey producing areas — like the eastern United States and the Mediterranean — are gone because there are no eels left.”The Yukon lampreys are about two feet long and weigh up to a half pound. Instead of going to dinner plates, these fish are frozen whole and shipped off to universities in the Lower 48.Lampreys are being studied for their unusual nervous systems, and Michigan State University researchers have identified a stress hormone that may provide clues to the evolution of the human endocrine system. Yukon lampreys also contain 30 percent high quality fish oils for human use.Libido boostersFor centuries, oysters have been credited with boosting libido, but until recently there was no scientific evidence to back that up.New studies reveal that ancient aphrodisiac claim has merit. Researchers at Miami’s Barry University told the American Chemical Society they have discovered that oysters, mussels and clams contain compounds that prompt the release of sexual hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen.Oysters are also loaded with zinc, a key nutrient for testosterone production for both men and women. Foods high in protein and zinc, like oysters, have been credited with keeping men virile well into old age. But the scientists caution you’d have to eat an overwhelming number of oysters to really get the benefits. Even in his sexual prime, the famous lover Casanova supposedly ate 50 oysters every day to keep his stamina in top form.Bivalves aren’t the only seafood libido boosters. A few years ago the tuna industry was gleefully touting canned tuna as “Viagra of the Sea.” That notion was spawned by a book titled “Temptations, Igniting the Pleasure and Power of Aphrodisiacs” that claimed diet changes can “awaken a sleepy libido.” It recommended eating more canned tuna to boost the intake of omega-3s. Since researchers believe omega-3 fatty acids help ward off depression, the book concludes that eating more tuna lifts your spirits, resulting in a better love life.Alaska’s salmon industry can ride on the coat tails of that claim. For more than a decade, health scientists have listed wild salmon as containing more omega-3s than tuna. Spread the love.“I love oysters. It’s like kissing the sea on the lips.” Jean-Paul FarqueCrab reviewThe North Pacific Fishery Management Council will review the Bering Sea crab catch share program during the week of Dec. 6 in Anchorage.<COL>Fishermen see increase in prices over 2009<COL>2010-12-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/12/wild-salmon-prices-feel-bite-of-hard-times/<COL>Wild salmon prices feel bite of hard timesThe global recession took a bite out of  wild salmon prices this summer for both fishermen and processors.  Although the coast wide supply increased by 16.8% over last year, the average dock price of $.51/lb. was a drop of 20.3%  – but still an improvement over the $.44/lb. average in 2007.According to Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley all but sockeye salmon prices had double-digit declines at the docks this year. King salmon took the biggest hit – the average price of $2.62 per pound was a drop of 42.3 percent. Coho prices averaged $.86 per pound, a drop of 32.8 percent. For chums, the average dock price dropped to $.44 per pound, down from $.59 per pound. Unfortunately, the huge drop in the pink salmon catch couldn’t offset the bad economy – pink prices fell to $.22 per pound this year, down from $.35 per pound in 2008.Alaska’s most valuable salmon –sockeye – accounted for about 56 percent of the total value of this year’s catch. The average dock price (before any post season adjustments was $.80 per pound down only 4.8 percent from last year and exactly the same as 2007.On the bright side, Talley said the lower prices kept wild salmon in front of consumers all summer, when farmed salmon were short and high-priced. Talley predicts that  helped prime the pump for a market that could be ready to boom as the economic recession tapers off next year.Alaska’s 2009 salmon haul is valued so far at just over $370 million at the docks, compared to $452 million last year, for a smaller catch.Frozen is earth friendlyFrozen salmon is better for the planet than fresh, because it takes so much less energy to get from the ocean to dinner plates. That’s according to a study by Oregon-based Ecotrust which studied factors from catching salmon, keeping it cold and flying them to markets around the world.“It’s exciting to see,” said Ray Riutta, director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. “There was a stigma a few years ago that it had to be fresh. We’ve done a good job of changing that perception.”ASMI has seen steady growth in its national Cook it Frozen campaign, Riutta said. He credits chefs for building consumer confidence in frozen fish, as nearly 60 percent of Americans eat seafood at restaurants.Frozen salmon can be transported by freighter or train, which uses far less fossil fuel than jets. Farmed salmon puts a heavy hidden demand on fossil fuels, mainly from feeds that use forage fish, or corn and soy, which are fuel intensive to grow and harvest.   Ecotrust credited seine caught wild salmon for having a lower carbon footprint than troll caught fish.Nearly half of America’s 110 million households now eat frozen seafoods, says market researcher Packaged Facts, and frozen seafood  has become the fastest growing industry sector  since 2000.The group predicts that demand for frozen seafood will continue to grow due to more varieties of “better for you” entrees that cater to time-crunched families.  The acceptance of frozen seafood has big implications for Alaska. It equates to pennies or nickels per pound in transportation costs instead of dimes and quarters for fresh fish. It also reduces risk, according to salmon market expert Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Group.“Filleting salmon and sending it out fresh represents a tremendous risk in terms of shelf life. That is a really important value component among big buyers,” he said.The Ecotrust report says if salmon lovers switched to buying 75 percent frozen salmon, it would have a greater positive impact on the environment than if all of Europe ate salmon that is farmed locally.Big bucks for baitAlaska’s herring roe fisheries grab all the headlines each spring, when the ripened fish are harvested primarily for their eggs. Fishermen get paid between $200 and $600 per short ton for the roe herring, virtually all which goes to Japan. Another herring fishery – called food and bait – runs behind the scenes through much of the year. It brings big bucks as bait – at Upper Cook Inlet, for example – up to $2,000 a ton.. “In the Inlet the halibut and king salmon sport fisheries buy it for bait, and also the commercial fishermen use it for halibut bait, said Jeff Fox, area management biologist at ADF&G in Soldotna.Between15-20 setnet operators take part in the Inlet fishery, catching from 15 to 30 tons a year. The herring are caught about a week before they are ripe, Fox said.“The fishermen prefer the green herring because it stays on the hook better. So that’s why it commands a better price than sac roe,” he explained.Sellers in Cook Inlet get around $1 per pound for herring, or up to $12 for a package of seven frozen fish. At Dutch Harbor last year two seiners and one gillnetter fetched between  $300-$490 per ton, totaling $604,000 for the region’s 1,722 ton quota.Jeff Fox said demand for herring bait far outstrips supply. In fact, huge amounts are sourced each year from the east coast and Canada to make up for the shortfall. The bait herring will be even harder to come by next year, as quotas from Labrador to Cape Hatteras are set to be slashed 45 percent to 109,000 tons. That could increase the value of Pacific bait herring even more.<COL>Wild salmon prices feel bite of hard times<COL>2009-12-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/12/draft-catch-share-policy-calls-for-sustainability/<COL>Draft catch-share policy calls for sustainabilityBy Laine WelchFederal managers have officially come out in support of catch share programs as the best tool for managing U.S. fisheries.“Catch-share is a general term for several fishery management strategies that allocate a specific percentage of the total allowable fishery catch, or a specific fishing area, to individuals, cooperatives, communities or other entities,” said Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Jane Lubchenco. “So each recipient of the catch-share is directly accountable to stop fishing when its specific quota is reached.”Speaking at a press conference last Thursday, Lubchenco said that, while the policy is not a mandate, NOAA “enthusiastically encourages” catch-share programs as a way to end overfishing, rebuild stocks and provide more stability to fishing communities.“Business as usual with our traditional management tools is not accomplishing what we need,” she said. “We find the science is compelling that catch-shares help restore the health of ecosystems and get fisheries on a path to profitability and sustainability.”Crafting the details of any catch-share programs will fall to the nation’s eight regional fishery management councils.“One of the strengths of catch-shares is that they allow councils a great deal of flexibility to design programs that meet specific goals,” Lubchenco said.The federal draft policy recommends that fishery councils pay particular attention to six issues: 1) Identify specific management goals for each program, (i.e., reducing bycatch or ending the race for fish); 2) Choose whether, when and to whom to allow transfers of catch-shares; 3) Use catch-share design options to promote sustainable fishing communities; 4) Evaluate designs that would set aside shares to allow new generations of fishermen or small businesses into the fishery; 5) Consider a royalty system to support management and research as fisheries become more profitable under catch-shares; 6) Periodically review catch-share programs to gauge if they are meeting goals and objectives.Catch-share programs have been used in the United States since 1990 and are now operating in 13 commercial fisheries, including Alaska halibut, sablefish and Bering Sea crab.Lubchenco said the Senate has included $18.6 million in next year’s appropriations budget to jump start more catch-share programs. The public has until April 10 to comment on the draft policy. Learn more and comment at www.nmfs.noaa.gov/catchshares.Halibut dipAs expected, Pacific halibut catches are set to take another nosedive next year. Scientific advisors to the International Pacific Halibut Commission are recommending a coast-wide catch of 48.7 million pounds; a 10-percent decline for the second consecutive year. The catch numbers include halibut fisheries on the Pacific coast, British Columbia and Alaska.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the big flatfish, and next year’s catch is pegged at 44.3 million pounds, down just slightly from 2009.Biologists say Alaska’s halibut stocks are still abundant, but on a downturn as two strong year classes from the late 1990s leave the fishery. Two more big pulses are set to enter the fishery, said IPHC director Bruce Leaman, but those recruits are growing slowly.“We think the low growth rates are associated both with high density of not only halibut, but also arrowtooth flounder in the Gulf of Alaska,” Leaman said. “That is probably depressing growth rates pretty substantially.”Once again, Southeast fishermen are bracing for the biggest pounding. Just 3.7 million pounds is being recommended for that region; a 26-percent cut. That reflects a 65 percent reduction for Southeast longliners over the past five years.For other Alaska regions: Area 3A, Central Gulf, the suggested catch is 20 million pounds, down 7.9 percent; Area 3B, Western Gulf, 9.9 million pounds, a drop of 9.2 percent; Area 4A, Eastern Aleutians, 2.3 million pounds, down 8.6 percent; Area 4B, Western Aleutians, could get a 15.5 percent boost to 2.2 million pounds. Halibut fishermen in Areas CDE of the Bering Sea could see their catches drop 6.1 percent to 3.3 million pounds.The IPHC will finalize the 2010 halibut catch limits in Seattle at its annual meeting in late January.How’s our salmon selling?When people talk about the value of Alaska’s salmon fishery, they refer to the ex-vessel value; the prices paid at the docks. But that represents only 40 percent of the total value of the salmon industry. It is first wholesale prices that provide a more complete picture, and those values are trending upward, according to the Alaska Salmon Price Report by the state Dept. of Revenue.The ASPR covers wholesale volumes and values by species and region for six key salmon products: canned salmon, frozen and fresh H&G (headed and gutted), frozen and fresh fillets and salmon roe.The latest report covers May through August, which reflects more than 90 percent of the sales of fresh salmon, and more than half of the year’s sales of frozen salmon and roe.According to a breakdown in ASMI’s Seafood Market Report, the first wholesale value for all Alaska salmon totaled $447 million, up 10 percent from the same period in 2008.Frozen H&G salmon showed the biggest boost to $191 million, up 43 percent. The first wholesale value of fresh and frozen salmon fillets increased 35 percent to $64 million.Not so for salmon roe. Sales increased to 10 million pounds, but the value decreased 16 percent to $58 million.The sales season for canned salmon runs from September through the following August. For the 2008 pack, canned salmon dropped 24 percent in wholesale value to $67 million for that time period. While average case prices were up substantially – especially for pink salmon – the increase was offset by low sales of canned pinks and sockeye.

Sean Parnell unveiled the proposed budget for the 2010/2011 fiscal year, which begins July 1. For the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the operating budget request is $188.6 million, including general fund and federal dollars, 4.1 percent higher than the current budget.For the department’s largest division, commercial fisheries, the budget request of $61.7 million is less than a one-percent increase. The Parnell budget also is proposing a $31.3 million capital budget for special Fish and Game projects.Among them: • $250,000 to develop a database for the deckhand labor data project; • $200,000 for Yukon River chum salmon aerial surveys; • $250,000 for assessment and feasibility of the Yukon R. sonar at Pilot Station; • $750,000 for genetic screening to estimate stock composition of Western Alaska salmon fisheries; • $600,000 for research on Alaska marine mammals on the Endangered Species list; •  $700,000 for facilities, vessels, and aircraft maintenance and upgrades.Bigger capital budget-getters include: • The  Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, $15 million; • $7.5 million for Pacific Salmon Treaty Chinook fishery mitigation; • $2 million for statewide facility deferred maintenance projects.For other ADF&G divisions, the proposed Sport Fish budget is down slightly to $47.5 million. The Wildlife Conservation Division is in line for a 12.5 percent budget increase to $41.3 million. Habitat is also penciled in for a sizable increase. The governor’s proposed budget must be approved by the Alaska Legislature, which convenes in mid-January.

It totally worked.”Barbie Lobster, as she is known, has been hauled up by various fishermen at least 10 times along the 26-mile channel between Baker’s Island and Mount Desert Rock.The VHF radios used by lobstermen would buzz with chatter and laughter each time a new sighting of Barbie was reported.Costello made a special trip to Wal-Mart in Ellsworth to buy the Barbie clothes. He had wanted to dress up a jumbo lobster, but it was too fat to fit into a Barbie doll outfit. They chose a svelte 11/2-pound crustacean instead.“They slipped right on, just like Cinderella,” Bright said of the tiny pink shoes he and Costello put on Barbie.Costello disagreed, saying it was a challenge to put the high heels on the little lobster legs. There are four legs on each side so the men attached them to the center two.“You try squeezing Barbie shoes on a lobster,” he said. “That was the most time-consuming thing.”Barbie hasn’t been seen since early December and apparently was unkempt and nearly naked, with just her pretty pink high heels still hanging on.Costello said if she and the shoes survive until spring, she may be home free for another season.“We have our spring fashions all ready to go,” he said.<COL>Fish-funding, food and ‘Barbie’ lobster<COL>2009-12-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/01/alaska-contributes-most-of-the-nation%e2%80%99s-seafood/<COL>Alaska contributes most of the nation’s seafoodBy Laine Welch2009 retrospectiveAs we look back at Alaska’s seafood industry over the past year, consider this: 62 percent of our nation’s seafood landings come from Alaska, as does 96 percent of all U.S. wild salmon. Globally, Alaska ranks ninth in the world in terms of seafood production. The seafood industry is second only to “Big Oil” in revenues it generates to state coffers, and provides more Alaska jobs than oil/gas, mining, tourism and timber combined. Alaska’s abundant and sustainable fishery resources are the envy of all other seafood producers, and its fishery management is regarded as a model around the world.Here are more fishing notables from 2009:• The 2009 salmon harvest of 162 million fish was the 11th best catch since statehood. Pinks pulled a big no-show in Prince William Sound.• The global recession tamped down all fish prices; cod prices got especially clobbered when lines of credit dried up.• Fishery advocates swarmed visiting Obama officials to urge them to reinstate a ban on offshore oil and gas lease sites located in six million acres of the nation’s “fish basket” – Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering Sea.• More local salmon made it onto school lunch trays in Alaska.• Alaska pollock was added to the USDA food commodities program.• Three-quarters of the dockside value of Alaska’s fisheries continued to go to non-residents.• Halibut prices fell from the $5 per pound range of recent years by more than one dollar. Catch limits continued to decline, awaiting entry of new recruits into the fishery. Likewise, the pollock catch was cut to one of the lowest levels in decades.• Bristol Bay had one of its best red salmon runs ever; fishermen were again put on trip limits by overwhelmed processors.• The first item made from genetically modified animal materials was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Next to get the nod is likely to be Atlantic salmon, which grow twice as fast as normal. No labeling is required alerting consumers that foods are genetically altered.• Exxon finally sent checks to “oiled” plaintiffs 20 years after the big spill in Prince William Sound. Most checks were cut by more than half after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the punitive damages award was excessive.• Yukon fishermen got no fishing openers for king salmon, meaning another winter of no money and Katrina-like responses by the State.• Kodiak became home to one of the biggest boat lifts in the world.• Fishing net recycling programs were a huge success at Naknek, Dillingham, Petersburg, Kenai and Cordova. The programs kept thousands of pounds of old nets out of local landfills.• For the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency put the brakes on fossil fuel emissions from U.S. power plants. The EPA will set controls for coal- and oil-fired power plants by November 2011. Alas, most of the pollutants in Alaska waters come from Asian power plants.• The farthest north global soccer competition was held in Cordova as a way to recognize the hundreds of seafood workers that come to town each summer. Processors fielded six teams – Ocean Beauty’s Team Mexico took home the trophy.• Fishing still tops the list of most dangerous jobs, with a fatality rate 26 times higher than that of all US workers.• The North Pacific Fishery Management Council began streaming its meetings live over the Internet.• The feds announced a new national policy for marine aquaculture in waters from three to 200 miles offshore. They also set policy claiming   catch shares as the best tool for fisheries management.Fish Picks and Pans for 2009Best fish eco-fuel:  algaeScariest fish story: ocean acidificationBest back to the future for fishing boats: sailsBiggest fish food fight: Alaska spends $20 million on foreign fish-feed for salmon hatcheries, when it makes more than 200,000 tons each year.Biggest fish boom: Turning Alaska’s 3 billion pounds of fish byproducts into oils, nutraceuticals, biofuels, etc.Friendliest fishing town: CordovaBest fish icons:  Alaska’s Bering Sea Crabbers<COL>Alaska contributes most of the nation’s seafood<COL>2010-01-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/12/tide-may-turn-on-fishing-permit-sales/<COL>Tide may turn on fishing permit salesBy Laine WelchSales of fishing permits and catch shares is a good way to gauge how confident people feel about the economy, and brokers say the past year has been a mixed bag in their business.“It’s been the slowest year I’ve ever had, but with the most phone time ever. There’s a lot of interest, but not a lot of movement,” said Olivia Olsen at Alaskan Quota and Permits in Petersburg. “A lot of guys want to buy and they had the money, but the world situation and some declining fish stocks didn’t give them a lot of confidence.”Mike Painter at the Permit Master in Anacortes, Wash. agreed, but added the tide seems to be turning.“Most fishermen seem to have money saved up and they’ve been hanging on to it during the downturn in the economy. Now things look like they’re starting to loosen up and guys are starting to spend,” Painter said.In the past six weeks, Painter said business has picked up considerably, most notably, for salmon permits at Bristol Bay and Prince William Sound.  Many people waited to see what decisions the Board of Fisheries made earlier this month in the Bristol Bay fishery, he said, and then they started putting down their money.“Drift permits are at $90,000 now and they are hard to find at that price.  That indicates that they are going to continue to creep up,” Painter said.Another hot item is drift and seine permits at Prince William Sound, where prices are going up daily, Painter said.“In the past month almost overnight offers went from $105,00 to $110,000 to $120,000 for Copper River permits. Seine permits have moved up from $60,000 to $65,000. Those are the two that have moved the most in the least amount of time,” Painter said.Much of that is being fueled by Exxon settlement checks that are   being paid out now.“A lot of people are getting some pretty big checks, so if they want something they’re not afraid to pay for it,” he said.Olivia Olsen said she talks to a lot of people about Kodiak salmon permits, but there hasn’t been much action. Painter said he is selling a seine permit now “that’s in the high $20’s –  about where it left off before the season.”“Kodiak has had some decent seasons, but   the interest in the permits doesn’t reflect that,” he added.Neither broker sees much interest in fishing permits further west. Painter called the Kuskowkim and Yukon  “the quietest areas as far as permit trading goes.”Prices for catch shares of halibut are on a downward slide, due mostly to big price drops at the docks and uncertainty about the stocks.For several seasons, halibut routinely topped $5.00 a pound to fishermen; this year prices were down by more than a dollar. Shares that a year ago were fetching $30 a pound for prime areas in the Central Gulf are now going for $23-$24 per pound.“I think prices will stay there for awhile. I don’t think sellers are going to want to come down, particularly after they have to take a cut in what they can sell,” Painter said, referring to halibut catch limits that have decreased 10% again for 2010.In Southeast Alaska, Olsen said there is lots of interest in buying catch shares of halibut, but uncertainty is dampening sales. The fishery has been slashed by more than 25% for two years in a row, and just 3.3 million pounds might be available for longliners in 2010.  Olsen said catch shares of halibut in Southeast range from $21-24 a pound.Many people picked up smaller permits this year to  “fill in the gaps” from shortfalls in the larger fisheries. Black cod permits at Chatham and Clarence Straits are some of the most desired, and Olsen said there is a great deal of interest for Southeast salmon seine and gillnet permits, and lots of sales for hand troll permits.Neither broker does much business with catch shares for Bering Sea crab because there are so few sales offered. Shares of red king crab top $30 a pound and Mike Painter said the estimates in general are “six to seven times what the ex-vessel price is.”Both brokers said the overall mood among Alaska fishermen is good, and they are hopeful about the future.“Everything needs to stabilize within the whole economy and with the fish stocks so people know what’s happening. I think it will be slow for another year or so, but the product is only getting better,” Olsen said.“The last couple of years have been pretty decent fish wise,” said Mike Painter. “There are some bad spots here and there, but the value of the fish is coming up and demand is strong. It all looks good to me.”Pay up timeAlaska fishermen who hold catch shares of halibut, sablefish (black cod) and Bering Sea crab pay an annual fee to the federal government to covers costs to manage and enforce those fisheries. The fee, which is capped at three percent, is based on dock prices through September and averaged across the state.The fee for the 2009 halibut and black cod fisheries was increased slightly to 1.6 percent (1.4% last year), and it yielded $3.3 million for coverage costs.For halibut, the overall value for the 2009 fishery is $132 million and $77 million for black cod.“That is $43 million lower than the 2008 value for halibut and $8 million higher for black cod,” said fee coordinator Troie Zuniga at NOAA Fisheries in Juneau. “This year’s average price for halibut is $3.13 per pound and $3.21 for black cod. That compares to averages of $3.70 and $2.58  for 2008,” she added.Zuniga said bills went out to 2,184 Alaska longliners this year, down from 2,302 in 2008 and 2,382 in 2007.  Fee payments are due by January 31st.For the 2008/2009 Bering Sea crab fisheries, the dockside value topped  $212 million, a $10 million increase from the previous year.  Just 22  “registered receivers” were sent bills for management and enforcement costs of $2.2 million for the 2008/09 crab fishery. Zuniga said previous fees at 3% have resulted in collections greater than the actual coverage costs, so crabbers are already ahead in payments.“Fee revenues remain to cover projected actual costs for 2010. As a result, NMFS has determined that the fee percentage will be zero percent for the 2009/2010 crab fishing year,” Zuniga said.Bone up on fishAlaska gubernatorial candidates should mark their calendars for April 15 in Kodiak. That’s the date for the famous ComFish fisheries debate, which is broadcast live, statewide via APRN. The popular event has been sponsored by the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce since 1990.  Every governor elected since then has participated in the “goober debate.”Seafood soiree!The 17th annual Symphony of Seafood new products competition will be held on February 3in Seattle and winners will be announced at a gala soiree on February 19 in Anchorage.

Managers had predicted a catch closer to 69 million pinks.Most of the fish was coming from Prince William Sound — 65 million so far — toppling the record of 63.5 million pink salmon set in 2007. The fleet of 164 seiners hauled in a mind-boggling 20.3 million pinks during one week in early August. The take could have been much bigger, but the huge catches exceeded processing capacity and boats were put on limits. Southeast Alaska fishermen were also seeing strong pink salmon catches, so far approaching 22 million fish.Prices for Alaska’s “bread-and-butter” fish have also increased to 35 cents a pound, compared to an average of 22-24 cents last year.In fact, prices for pinks in their various product forms have trended upward in the past few years. According to market tracker Ken Talley, the wholesale price for frozen pinks was holding steady at 93 cents a pound in 2008 and 2009, up from 77 cents the previous year. Fresh pinks jumped from 84 cents in 2008, to $1.42 in 2009. Frozen pink fillets were wholesaling at $1.16 a pound last year.And get this: most of Alaska’s pink salmon still end up in cans, and cases of canned talls were fetching $118.88 per case, up from $59.11 in 2008. Also favoring Alaska is the fact that competing pink salmon catches from Russia are expected to be down by half from a year ago.Price checkA higher harvest and higher prices mean the value of Alaska’s 2010 salmon fishery will dwarf last year’s dockside value of $370 million, which took a big hit from the global recession.Sockeye salmon account for two-thirds of Alaska’s total salmon value, and prices to fishermen this year have soared. At Kodiak, reds fetched a base price of $1.49 per pound, up from $1.11 last year. Prices at Prince William Sound were $2.25, compared to $1.72. For Southeast, sockeye prices were reported at $2, an increase of 75 cents per pound.Two-thirds of Alaska’s total sockeye harvest comes from Bristol Bay, and fishermen there received a base of 95 cents this summer — up from 70 cents last year. With bonuses for chilled and bled fish, the final price at Bristol Bay could climb to around $1.20 per pound, boosting the value of the catch to $170 million. That’s an increase of more than $40 million from 2009. Alaska’s total sockeye salmon harvest is expected to fall shy of the forecasted 45.8 million reds, but is still a respectable 40.3 million so far.Canadian crunch?Salmon prices don’t settle out until long after the fishing season, when sales are concluded at year’s end and beyond. And customers look at the whole salmon pack from North America, meaning Alaska, the West Coast and Canada.The market could get a shake-up from the first commercial fishery in four years at British Columbia’s Fraser River. There, 30 million sockeye salmon are expected to arrive next week; the biggest red run since 1913.Industry reports say there are concerns whether B.C.’s processors have the capacity to handle such a monumental harvest. Already, ice is being trucked in from Vancouver, and plans are being made to ship fish to Alaska for processing.McAdams talks fishWhether the winner in the U.S. Senate race is Murkowski or Miller, they will face Scott McAdams of Sitka as the Democratic challenger in November.At a press conference after the primary election, McAdams — who grew up in Petersburg — said commercial fishing “goes to the core of my identity.”“I learned to read, write and reason in a town where 85 cents on the dollar came from commercial fishing,” McAdams said. “I spent five years as a deckhand working in fisheries throughout the state. I seined in Southeast, Kodiak, I hand-bait longlined in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. I have an appreciation and a great affinity for the lifestyle and the culture, and for the need for commercial fishing in our state.”When asked how he feels about the current administration’s push toward Marine Spatial Planning, or ocean zoning and the fears that it will shut down fisheries, McAdams responded emphatically.“I will put no affiliation, no loyalty, no entity above my commitment to Alaskans,” he said. “I will stand up and fight for Alaska fishermen against every policy that stands in the way of healthy fish stocks and any policy that puts Alaska’s fishermen in a bad position.”McAdams said he does not support the proposed Pebble Mine.“I believe that, as the largest red-salmon fishery on the planet, it needs to be enhanced, maintained and preserved throughout the next millennia.”McAdams said he supports oil and gas development, but that Alaska should be at the forefront of national efforts to develop a renewable energy economy.McAdams is serving his first two-year term as mayor of Sitka and is the region’s Director of Community Schools. At the national school board level, McAdams helped pass policies supporting Alaska Native language instruction.<COL>Profuse pinks surpass predictions, push processing capacity<COL>2010-09-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/02/when-evaluating-investments-look-at-value-not-just-price/<COL>When Evaluating Investments, Look at Value – Not Just PriceMost investors pay a great deal of attention to the price of their investments —  yesterday’s price, today’s price, tomorrow’s price, next year’s price and so on. And that’s understandable, because we always want the prices of our investments to rise. Yet, if you focus too much on prices, you could end up making some costly mistakes.Why? Because price-driven behavior is emotional behavior — and as an investor, you’re much better off making decisions with your head, not your heart. Suppose, for example, that you’ve seen a steep decline in the price of one of your investments. After a while, you may feel that you just can’t take it anymore and you decide to “cut your losses” by selling the investment.  Conversely, you may have an investment that has gone up and up — and to grab even bigger gains, you buy more shares.Both these decisions could backfire on you. When you sold the investment whose price had fallen, you might find yourself on the investment “sidelines” if that same investment starts to turn around. And when you throw more money at an investment whose price has skyrocketed, you’re betting against history — because no investment goes up forever. Furthermore, in both cases, your emotions will have led you to violate one of the guidelines of investing: buy low and sell high.But apart from the tactical errors you may make when you over-concentrate on price movements, you’re also ignoring another key characteristic of investments — their value.Traditionally, an investment’s “value” has been largely defined as whether or not it’s considered “expensive” or “cheap.” That’s why many investors take a close look at a stock’s price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Generally speaking, a high P/E means a stock is more expensive, relative to its earnings, than a stock with a low P/E. Investors may be willing to pay more for the high P/E stocks because they feel these companies will be worth more in the future.But P/E doesn’t tell the whole story of investment value. Any individual investment may have value to you because it can help you diversify your holdings. And while diversification, by itself, can’t guarantee a profit or protect against a loss, it can help you reduce the effects of volatility on your portfolio. For instance, if your portfolio is heavy with stocks, the presence of some bonds — even those whose market price has fallen because interest rates have risen — can help reduce the impact of a downturn that primarily affects stocks.Clearly, the value of any investment has several dimensions — any or all of which may be valuable to you as your pursue your goals. So, as you build, maintain and adjust your portfolio over time, keep an eye on the changing prices of your investments — but don’t overlook their true value.<COL>When Evaluating Investments, Look at Value – Not Just Price<COL>2010-02-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/02/alaska-seafood-free-of-radiation-from-fukushima-incident/<COL>Alaska seafood free of radiation from Fukushima incidentBy Laine WelchAlaska seafood is free of radiation stemming from Japan’s 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster.That was the take-home message from the Alaska Department of Conservation to the State Senate Resources Committee at a recent hearing.Citing  information from  the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Pacific states — including Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington, as well as Health Canada — “all have demonstrated there are no levels of radiation that are of a public health concern,” said Marty Brewer, director of DEC’s Environmental Health Division.She added that only small amounts of radiation have been detected from the reactor source.“There has been detection of cesium that is reportedly from Fukushima, but at miniscule levels,” Brewer said.DEC Commissioner Larry Hartig said programs in the Lower 48 are testing fish that swim between the Gulf of Alaska, the West Coast and Japan, and they have come up with a clean bill of health. The DEC is also monitoring marine debris washing ashore in Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound, Hartig said.None of the debris that has washed ashore anywhere in the U.S. has shown signs of radiation, so far.Fish behavior cuts bycatchFishing gear experts are using fish behavior to take a bite out of unwanted salmon bycatch in trawl nets. Video cameras inside nets revealed several years ago that Alaska pollock and salmon behave very differently when captured. Salmon were able to swim against the strong flow within the net better than the pollock, said John Gauvin, a gear specialist who has worked closely with Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska trawl fleets for decades.“You would see the salmon moving forward in the net at times, and you would see the pollock steadily dropping back, with some ability to move forward, but at a loss,” he explained. “They would move a little bit forward, and then move a lot back.”Trawlers will soon begin field-testing a so-called, “over-and-under” net device to see how it performs.“We are pretty excited about this device and will be doing testing this spring in the Gulf,” Gauvin said. “Then, hopefully — in the fall — in the Bering Sea.”A “flapper” excluder device, used by many trawlers since 2012, has resulted in a 25-37 percent Chinook salmon escapement with very little loss of pollock. While it works well, Gauvin said the design is difficult to adopt widely into the fishery and takes a lot of fine tuning.Finding “cleaner” gear that is affordable and adaptable will drive the future of our fisheries, Gauvin said.“What is interesting to me today is that, in many ways, success in the fisheries is not so much what you catch, but what you don’t catch,” he mused. “Fishermen spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid things they are not supposed to catch so they can continue to make a living.”Fish equals healthy heartsFebruary is American Heart Month, and the role of seafood and heart health is being featured in a nationwide media blitz.The American Heart Association has placed 1 million magazine inserts in major newspapers from Boston to Los Angeles, and they include full page ads about the importance of eating more seafood.“The science is there to help all of us understand that eating seafood twice a week can be great for our heart health, but that message is just not getting out,” said Linda Cornish, executive director of the nonprofit Seafood Nutrition Partnership. The partnership promotes the twice-a-week message across the country. “So this is our first effort to work with health partners to bring a credible message to Americans. We are very excited about it.”“I can see that people understand seafood is good for them,” she continued. “The hurdles come from knowing how to buy it and cook it, and understanding the different varieties of seafood they can include in their diet.”Getting across those hurdles is especially important for women, (who do most home-food shopping). Heart disease is, by far, the No. 1 killer of American women.Cornish said the Seafood Nutrition Partnership is also testing outreach messages to see how they resonate with consumers, and balance out negative messages.“What you are seeing in terms of the different messages on mercury and toxicity is very well-founded; it’s just that you hear more of those messages versus the good news on seafood,” Cornish said. “So, our initiative is to try and get more positive messages out about seafood and provide a more balanced view.”Pick the winnersThe Fishing Family Photo Contest from the Alaska Seafood marketing Institute attracted more than 700 entries, and now it’s time to vote for your favorites.Categories include Best Family or Kids, Best Old-School or Throwback, Best Fish, Best Scenic, Best Boat, Best Humor and Best Action photo.The fan favorite wins two Alaska Airlines tickets, while other top winners get iPads.

Let halibut decideBy Laine WelchBait is always a big expenditure for many fishing businesses, and pollock could help cut costs for Alaska halibut longliners who fish in the Gulf.Researchers have tested pollock in two projects to see if it might replace pricier chum salmon as halibut bait. Fish biologists use more than 300,000 pounds of chums in their stock surveys each year, costing nearly half a million dollars. The baits are used at more than 1,200 testing stations from Oregon to the Bering Sea.A pilot study three years ago in the central Gulf and off British Columbia showed promising signs for pollock.“We looked at several different baits: our standard chum salmon, pink salmon, pollock and herring,” said Bruce Leaman, executive director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission. “Pollock showed a very strong indication of both better catch rates and lower bycatch rates, so we were very excited about that.”In 2012, the bait project was expanded coastwide, and that led to mixed results.“One confirmed what we saw in the Gulf, in that pollock was a very effective bait there relative to chum salmon and we got good catch rates,” Leaman said. “But when we moved into the Bering Sea, we got completely opposite results, where the salmon bait performed better than the pollock.”“In the Bering Sea, pollock is a very significant component of halibut diet, and we were speculating that it may be a sort of novelty seeing salmon down there as bait, and that may have been what the fish were responding to,” he added.When the raw data was statistically compiled and corrected, Leaman said bait test results were inconsistent.“We do a number of corrections to the data to actually compare apples to apples across areas,” Leaman explained.  “When we did those comparisons, we found the results were nowhere near as strong as with the raw data. The raw data showed pollock had much better catch rates, lower amounts of sub-legal fish and lower amounts of bycatch. But when we did corrections to the data we found that those results were not so consistent.”The pollock bait still caught fewer small fish, but overall, the halibut catch rates were almost the same as with chum bait.“That’s not necessarily a bad result,” Leaman said.  “It’s just that pollock was not as grossly superior compared to what we had been using.”Studies will continue, but for now, chums will remain the bait of choice for science. Leaman does agree that pollock can be a good bait alternative for halibut in the Gulf.Call for fish techsThere is a severe shortage of fish technicians and biologists in Alaska’s largest industry, and it’s a trend that is predicted to continue for at least the next 10 years. A new statewide outreach programs started last fall aims to fill the bill.“Some of the positions for fisheries technicians include fish culturists, fishery observers, fish and wildlife surveyors, habitat restoration technicians, stream surveyors, fishery management assistants and hatchery technicians,” said  Kaitlin Kramer of Valdez. She is one of six outreach coordinators located in Petersburg, Kodiak, Homer, Sitka and Dillingham. They work for the University of Alaska/Southeast, as the Fish Tech program is headquartered at Sitka.“Our role is to reach out to the communities where we live and help promote the fisheries technology program, try to recruit students and facilitate internships with local industries,” Kramer added.Two training programs are offered: a Fisheries Technology certification and an Associates of Applied Science in Fisheries Technology. All classes are available to students on their computers.The classes are recorded online with instructors in Sitka, and as long as students have an internet connection, they can view them on their own time. Or they have the option of sitting in live as the class is being taught. Kramer said classes follow the college semester schedule, but people can tune in when it’s convenient.The Fish Tech program offers scholarships and internships. Registration opens April 21.

SWAMC is a nonprofit group that represents more than 50 communities, including Kodiak, Bristol Bay and the Aleutians.SWAMC interim director Erik O’Brien said the group networks with more than 100 members, and their main connection is fish.“The one unifying need of the whole industry is making the most value out of our fisheries and seafood,” O’Brien said. “That is really the one single thing everyone has in common.”The three-day summit will cover a wide range of economic topics, including bringing down the overall cost of energy, developing our human capital in our education, training and workforce development systems, and how the maximum sustained yield benefits the people of Alaska.Candidates for governor Bill Walker and Byron Mallott will participate in a debate on the final night. There is no word yet if Gov. Sean Parnell will show. The SWAMC Summit runs March 5-7 at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage.

The seafood company will be recognized as the top corporate sponsor by the State Head Start Association for its role in providing local salmon to children and elders throughout Southwest Alaska.“Head Start is not an easy program to run and this has been such a success,” said Regional Director Anne Shade, who nominated Peter Pan for the honor. “This annual award is one way we can really stand up and recognize the folks who go way above and beyond in Alaska for Head Start.”The “salmon to schools” program was spearheaded four years ago in Dillingham by school lunch director Patty Luckhurst, now retired after 21 years with the district.“It drove me crazy that the best fish in the world was swimming by and yet none of it was available to our school kids,” Luckhurst said.She approached Peter Pan Manager Tom Whinihan, who put out a call to fishermen to donate part of their sockeye salmon catch to the kids. The company earmarked tenders in three regions for the donations, which Peter Pan processed and packaged for free.“Tom Whinihan is a gem. He is really dedicated to this community,” Luckhurst added.So far, some 50,000 pounds has been donated to the program, which has expanded from Dillingham schools to nine outlying village schools.“Those schools also prepare meals for the elders in their villages, and they each have Head Start programs,” Luckhurst explained. “So we’re getting salmon meals to well over 1,000 kids and elders at least once a week.”Serving fish that is caught and processed locally saves the Dillingham school district roughly $12,000 in freight and other costs each year, she added.“The response has been so great,” said Jeanne Timmerman, Head Start wellness manager. “It makes so much sense that you can hardly believe it happens in this day and age.”Peter Pan’s Tom Whinihan agreed.“Gosh, this salmon is part of their culture, yet there was so much farmed fish like ‘Trout Treasures’ being brought in,” he said. “This is such a team-effort, and it’s so easy to do once you get it going. The result is all the little people and elders benefit from it. I do feel very grateful for it.”Whinihan is quick to credit the local fishermen.“They are the ones doing the hard work and being so generous with their donations,” he said. “We help facilitate it and ours is the easy part.”Ultimately, the hope is that similar partnerships will occur in other regions.“We hope our fish message gets out to all the state,” Director Shade said. “We would love to see it happen in other Alaska communities.”“If we can do this with a local processor here, there is no reason other schools and communities that have fish processors can’t do the same thing,”Luckhurst emphasized.“It would be such a good thing if they all got together and made it happen,” Whinihan said. “It’s so easy and it is not a lot of effort on anyone’s part once you get it going. So much of it is just good communication beforehand, and then it all falls into place.”Halibut updatesThere will be a bit less Pacific halibut for seafood buyers this year, but the bite isn’t as bad as the industry expected. The coast-wide catch limit of 50.67 million pounds is nearly two million more than anticipated — although still a 6.4 percent decrease from 2009. The International Pacific Halibut Commission — which oversees fisheries on the west coast, British Columbia and Alaska — set catch limits at its annual meeting last week in Seattle.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the halibut — the 2010 Alaska catch is 42.36 million pounds, a drop of 3.3 million from last year. The start date of the fishery is March 6 — 15 days earlier than the 2009 season. That will get fresh, first-of-the-season halibut to market just in time for Lent — the seafood industry’s biggest sales season. Market watchers predict prices to fishermen will start out very high. That, of course, remains to be seen.The IPHC also took up proposals to change regulations at its annual meeting, with a lot of time was spent on halibut sport fish issues.A proposal to create harvest tags for all recreational halibut fisheries in Alaska drew support, saying it would improve data collection. The Commission took no action on a proposal to change Alaska sport fish filleting requirements. It will, however, direct a working group to bring the issue back to the table next year. Commissioners said they want to see “more effective management” of the state’s sport charter fishery. They said they will be closely monitoring the progress of proposed catch sharing plans.The IPHC was also asked to reconvene a Halibut By-catch Work Group that last met almost 20 years ago. The group will examine how by-catch of halibut in other fisheries can best be accounted for in stock assessments and fisheries management. Alaska’s halibut fishery runs from March 6 through mid-November  http://www.iphc.washington.edu/Fish bits• Alaska smoked salmon chowder by Ivar’s Seafood won the People’s Choice Award at the Symphony of Seafood new products contest last week in Seattle.

Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham, would expand loan terms by the Division of Investments revolving loan fund to let fishermen borrow money to make upgrades for more fuel efficient engines.Another bill, introduced by Rep. John Harris of Valdez, would increase the amount that an injured fisherman could get for medical payments from $2,500 to $10,000 from the Fishermen’s Fund. It’s the first increase in 40 years. The Fishermen’s Fund was created before statehood, and is totally self-supporting from a portion of the fees paid for crew licenses.The fund is designed to help fishermen who are not covered by workman’s compensation.Other holdover fish bills might not fare so well, cautioned Bob Tkacz of Juneau, who has been covering legislative fishery issues for 15 years.A few months ago Rep. Bill Stoltze of Chugiak, co-chair of the House Finance Committee, warned that he would not move any commercial fishing bills this year.“That kind of throws a monkey wrench into things when one of the top committee co-chairs says he’s not going to move any of your bills out of his committee,” Tkacz said in a phone interview.One measure would ban pollution mixing zones in freshwater spawning and nesting areas. Another holdover bill imposes new data and protection requirements before permitting any large scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed.Tkacz predicts any bills to strengthen environmental regulations might not see the light of day.“Since he’s been in office, I don’t think there has been a single environmental proposal that Gov. Sean Parnell hasn’t opposed,” Tkacz said. “Polar bears, beluga whales or anything else that has to do with a pro-environmental stance Parnell has come out against, or he has directed the Dept. of Law to oppose. So I can’t see that those bills are going to have a whole lot of hope this year.”Two fish bills pre-filed before the legislative session take aim at First Alaskans’ subsistence priority. One introduced by Rep. Stolze would give personal-use fishing the top priority in a time of fish shortages.“Under current law, subsistence harvesters have top priority, then commercial, then personal-use, then sport,” Tkacz explained. “Stolze wants to kick personal-use up to the top of the scale.”Another bill pre-filed by Senator Albert Kookesh of Angoon aims to reinstate federal takeover of salmon management in some regions, where allegedly “the state has not managed properly for sustainable yield.”Several bills related to the Board of Fisheries also remain in the legislative hopper. Most notably is a conflict of interest measures and holding meetings in regions affected by Board decisions.“The odds they will move in an election year are pretty tough,” Tkacz said.There are about a dozen bills in the House Fisheries Committee that, if passed, will go to the House Resources Committee. But commercial fishing bills have a way of stalling there for the duration of the legislative session.“What we’ve got are a couple of co-chairs in House Resources — Craig Johnson of Anchorage and Mark Neuman of Wasilla — who have demonstrated a pretty strong affinity for the sportfishing side of things, and they don’t seem very interested in moving any commercial bills out of there,” Tkacz said.Keep on top of all fish bills with Tkacz’s weekly “Laws for the Sea.” Get more info at  junobob@att.net.IFQ surveyLots of studies have been done on Alaska’s Individual Fishing Quota program for halibut and sablefish since it was put in place 15 years ago. But none has focused specifically on the impacts of IFQs on crews and communities.Next week 1,200 IFQ holders will get a survey in their mailboxes aimed at gathering that kind of information.“This is something that people really don’t know, but it’s extremely important,” said Glenn Haight, a fisheries business specialist with Alaska Sea Grant’s Marine Advisory Program.“We’re going to be looking at information based on vessel size and class of IFQ, where the IFQ holders are from, where they’re getting their crew, what they are spending on crews, how much they are spending in communities and what communities they work in,” Haight explained.The IFQ survey is especially timely since more fisheries are already privatized, or in the pipeline.“This is just touching one segment of the IFQ fishery, but so far there has been very little information on community and crew impacts for all of these ‘rationalized’ fisheries,” Haight said.He added that the survey will yield the kinds of information that was needed before the halibut/sablefish IFQ program was launched in 1995.“A lot of things have changed since then. And a lot of mayors in small towns will tell you things have changed, but they can’t tell you how much,” Haight said. “So it’s my hope that as we move forward and continue to rationalize our fisheries, and we do it across the country, fishery managers will ask these kinds of questions before they push for rationalization. So that 15 years down the road they can survey it again and measure what actually happens to these small fishing communities over time.”Any halibut or black cod IFQ holders can respond to the survey, even if they don’t receive it by mail.

Early on, it looks like supplies of many seafood favorites will be a bit tighter. Some trends to watch:Forecasts for Alaska salmon are still trickling in, but insiders say this year’s total catch is likely to be lower than last season. A bright spot is Bristol Bay, which could see a sockeye harvest of nearly 32 million fish, slightly above last year. Huge salmon catches from Russia could throw a kink in the market, as they did last year with pinks, said analyst Ken Talley.Pacific coast salmon fisheries are expected to be bleak again this year. Talley said supplies of farmed salmon from Chile will be tight for the first half of the year, but should pick up after that and be back to normal in 2011. Chile’s shipments of fresh-farmed salmon fillets to the United States have dropped nearly 43 percent due to disease problems.In the Bering Sea, the catch for all fish species is pegged at just over 2 million metric tons; slightly below last year. Conversely, in the Gulf of Alaska, total catches should be up 9 percent. Pollock catches are expected to increase by 70 percent, with cod edging up 43 percent. The halibut catch limit is likely to fall by 10 percent for the second year in a row, and Gulf sablefish is down 7 percent.For Bering Sea snow crab, Talley said the market is in the doldrums, but Japanese buyers appear ready to buy. Advance prices for snow crab range from $1.10-$1.14 a pound, down from $1.40 last year. On a bright note, there is likely to be less snow crab this year from the world’s largest producer, Canada.Looking ahead to this fall for red king crab, the market is still being complicated by rampant poaching by Russian fleets. Talley said Russia has reportedly cut its Far East king crab quota again in an attempt to control the poaching problem.<COL>Bill in Legislature grants boat engine updates<COL>2010-01-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/01/alaska-deckhands-to-lend-fisheries-labor-data/<COL>Alaska deckhands to lend fisheries labor dataBy Laine WelchThe project that aims to collect labor data on Alaska deckhands is on track to come before the legislature this session.As self-employed workers, roughly 20,000 crew members have fallen through the cracks in terms of basic data that show their economic importance to the industry.“You can’t really estimate the total economic impact of commercial fishing unless you know something about the earnings and employment patterns for the crew members who are such an important part of the work force, and we don’t have any of that information,” said Geron Bruce, assistant director of the state commercial fisheries division.“The people who work as crew members on fishing boats are probably one of the only groups of laborers in Alaska not counted in some way by the state,” said Jan Conitz, project director for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.Bruce and Conitz are among a multi-agency and industry team that have worked for more than a year to develop a labor data collection program for deckhands in every Alaska fishery. A private contractor, Wostmann and Associates of Juneau, completed a feasibility report on three data collection options last month.“There are three separate documents outlining all that needs to be done with systems to make data reporting possible under three different options selected by our advisory committees last spring,” Conitz said. “They compared the options and looked at the feasibility and cost of each one, with recommendations about how we might go forward in developing the system.”Crew data could be collected by modifying existing landing reports or fish tickets. Conitz said actual implementation will be more difficult than anticipated.“This project is unique because it has to work with a number of existing systems and not overturn or rock the boat with any of them. It has to fit in, and that’s where some of the difficulties rise,” she explained. “Our  contractor has said many times that ‘one size does not fit all’ because there is so much diversity in Alaska’s fisheries.”Conitz said the contractor also has identified a number of changes and modifications that will help with other fisheries data collection, and make it possible for systems to work together and more efficiently than they do now.The governor’s draft budget includes $250,000 for the data collection project. The program must be authorized by the legislature. The agency and stakeholder advisory committees will meet this week to finalize their recommendations to Alaska lawmakers.“I wouldn’t say whether a crew data collection will be developed,” Conitz said, “just when.”Cod goes greenAlaska’s cod fisheries are one week away from getting a coveted eco-label from the international Marine Stewardship Council. The bright blue MSC label assures customers their seafood purchases come from sustainably managed fisheries that are friendly to the environment. The MSC label has been the global leader in getting the market to recognize and support sustainable fisheries.The Bering Sea cod longline fleet obtained the label years ago; now the rest of Alaska’s cod harvesters aim to do the same.“The final assessment report and action plan is posted on the MSC Web site, and that starts a 15-day time clock. If no objections are filed, the fishery is certified,” said Jim Browning, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation which has herded the rigorous third-party assessment process for the Alaska cod industry since 2006.The cost for the MSC certification has run about $240,000 — paid for with federal and private funding, as well as by the industry.The eco-label includes eight separate certifications for four gear types: longline, trawl, pot and jig fisheries in both the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. If any objections are filed against a sector, it will go into a 90-day hearing process. Browning said it will not derail the other fisheries.“Those that don’t get any objections filed will be certified at the end of the 15 days, which is Jan. 15. Just in time for those A-season deliveries,” Browning said.Market estimates show eco-labeled codfish get a 3-5 percent price premium over non-certified fish, although it depends on the market. More importantly, Browning said the label has become a necessary part of doing business.“Many large, international buyers are now requiring third-part certification of sustainability, and those doors would be closed to non-certified fisheries,” he said.Cod is regarded as the most popular fish in the world. At a time when Atlantic stocks are depleted or rebuilding around the world, Browning said cod from Alaska is a natural replacement.Cod fish will be in good company. Alaska salmon, pollock, halibut and black cod already have the MSC label; flatfish and Bering Sea crab also are in the pipeline.Learn more  at www.afdf.org or www.msc.org .Credit where it’s dueThere was some confusion about the source of the fish that was flown last week to Kotzebue by the U.S. Coast Guard. The 27,000 pounds of coho salmon fillets was donated by the Purse Seine Vessel Owners Association.“The chain of other donors is long, but it would not have been possible without the original donation made by the fishermen in Southeast Alaska, said Jim Harmon, director of SeaShare.SeaShare is a nonprofit organization that has become one of the largest sources of protein to food banks nationwide. SeaShare worked with the Food Bank of Alaska to donate over 125,000 pounds of seafood in Alaska last year.For more information, check out the SeaShare Web site at   www.seashare.org .<COL>Alaska deckhands to lend fisheries labor data<COL>2010-01-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/03/hatchery-reared-salmon-contribute-36-percent-of-2013-total-harvest/<COL>Hatchery-reared salmon contribute 36 percent of 2013 total harvestby Laine WelchAlaska’s salmon catch of 273 million salmon set a record last year; so did the number of salmon returning home to state hatcheries.The 2013 Fisheries Enhancement Report by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game shows a return of 112 million hatchery-reared salmon contributed 36 percent to the state’s total salmon harvest.The breakdown by species was 63 percent for chum salmon, 38 percent pinks, 23 percent Chinook salmon, 22 percent cohos and 5 percent of Alaska’s sockeye salmon catch can be credited to hatchery returns.Unlike farmed fish — which are crammed into nets or pens until they’re ready for market — Alaska salmon begin their lives in one of 35 state and/or privately run hatcheries and are released as fingerlings to the sea.Prince William Sound has the greatest amount of hatchery action. Last year, 80 percent of the Sound’s salmon catch was hatchery-produced, including 88 percent of chums and 80 percent of pinks. Some 45 percent of sockeye were hatchery-produced. The hatchery catch was worth $113 million to PWS salmon fishermen; 68 percent of the total value.Kodiak outpaced Southeast for hatchery catches last year. Fish returns to the island’s two hatcheries accounted for 35 percent of Kodiak’s total salmon catch; nearly triple from 2012. The value of $16 million was 26 percent of total ex-vessel value, which is an increase of $10 million. The hatchery catch breakdown was 12 percent chums, 20 percent coho, 15 percent sockeye and 38 percent pink salmon.At Southeast, hatcheries contributed 10 percent of the total salmon catch last year, valued at $52 million, or 21 percent of the dockside value. The breakdown was 81 percent of chums, 32 percent of Chinook, 26 percent coho, 14 percent sockeye and 2 percent pinks. Nearly 761,000 hatchery-reared coho salmon returned to Southeast. It was the largest ever.At Cook Inlet, just one percent of both the sockeye and pink salmon harvests were hatchery produced and valued at under $500,000.This year, nearly 52 million hatchery-produced fish are projected to return to Alaska.Crab crunchLots of Tanner crab is coming out of Alaska this winter. The crab is popular in buffets and casual-dining restaurants throughout the country. Southeast Alaska wrapped up its best fishery in a decade with 80 crabbers hauling up 1.25 million pounds in 11 days. At an average fishermen’s price of $2.70 per pound, the Tanner fishery is worth more than $3 million to the region.The snow crab coming out of the Bering Sea is a smaller cousin in the Tanner family at one to two pounds. It is half the size of the Southeast crab. With no ice problems this year, the Bering Sea snow crab catch of 54 million pounds could be hauled up in a couple of weeks. The base price for snow crab of $2.15/lb is similar to last year, worth nearly $120 million to the 46 boats in the fishery.Alaska snow crab will soon face a bigger competitor than its arch rival Canada, which already produces double the Bering Sea volume. Now all signs are pointing to a huge, untapped snow crab supply in the Barents Sea. The Norway Marine Institute projects yearly snow crab catches of 25,000 metric tons — 75,000 metric tons in the next 10 years, and possibly higher. That equals 55 million to 165 million pounds. Seafood.com reports crabbing is underway, and Norway and Russia are devising a management plan for the new snow crab fishery. Trident Seafoods is a uniquely American story; one of home town boy makes good, claims John Van Amerongen, author of “Catching a Deckload of Dreams.” It’s the story of Chuck Bundrant, founder and CEO of Trident Seafoods.“Think of a guy who hops into a ’53 station wagon in the middle of winter in Tennessee, stops to say good bye to family in Indiana, and then  heads west,” Van Amerongen said in a phone interview.“That was in 1961, and I like to say he didn’t know the pointy end from the square end of a fish or a fishing boat,” Van Amerongen explained. “He had just heard you could make enough money fishing in Alaska to pay your way through college, which was very important to him at the time.”Trident is now the largest source-to-table seafood company in North America. That’s pretty good for a guy who got his start in fish holds at Adak.“Literally, that’s where he got his start,” Van Am said. “So if you look at a beginning like that and see where he wound up, it’s a pretty amazing journey.”The Bundrant family asked Van Am —as he is known in the industry — to write Chuck’s story. Van Am was the voice behind the Alaska Fisherman’s Journal for more than two decades.Find “Catching a Deckload of Dreams” at the Trident Seafood website.Fish bitsThe Sitka roe herring fishery started March 20, and seiners took 5,000 tons in little more than two hours.

(Often called the National Marine Fisheries Service.) Her visit comes in response to a ComFish invitation from the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce. Accompanying her will be Senator Mark Begich, who is well-known for bringing DC officials to all corners of the state.“She is anxious to come and learn more about Alaska-specific issues and ComFish is the perfect event for her to really get a good sense of that,” Sen. Begich said in a phone conversation. “There is so much you learn when you go out to the remote communities.”Kodiak will provide an opportunity for Sobeck to see Alaska’s most diverse fishing fleet and busiest year-round working waterfront.“On the fish end, there is no question that Kodiak is the right place to be,” Begich said. “And we’re going to give her a good education.”As NOAA Fisheries Director, Sobeck will oversee the management and conservation of all marine life in U.S. waters, from coastal habitat to humpback whales — and everything in between. Sobeck is scheduled to spend two days in Kodiak starting April 17. See this year’s line-up atwww.comfishalaska.comLong haul for crab scienceAlaska’s golden king crab fleet plans to undertake the largest survey ever covering the entire range of the Aleutian Islands golden king crab stock; an 800 mile span from Dutch Harbor to Atka.“It is exciting to think that, for the first time, we will have a good index of the size of the golden population; age and sex structure, distribution and how deep they go, and what proportion of the population occurs at different depths,” said John Hilsinger, science advisor for the Aleutian King Crab Research Foundation.State managers surveyed a small area of the Aleutians through 2006, but there’s been no budget since to assess the crab stocks. The Foundation formed two years ago, and its harvester members partner with biologists during the golden king crab fleet fishery.“We plan to design the survey for the entire area, and then start off the first year by doing a portion of it to prove the concept and make sure it works and integrates well with the fishermen,” Hilsinger said. “Then we’ll spread it out.”The expanded surveys will start yielding meaningful results in three to five years, and it could be 10 years before a proven track record of the population can be modeled over time.“The crabbers are very committed to help over that time frame,” Hilsinger added. “That’s a real major contribution by the fleet.”The Aleutians golden king crab fishery harvest has operated under a 6-million-pound fixed cap for decades, and crabbers believe the catch could be higher. Eventually, goldens could overtake Bristol Bay and become Alaska’s largest king crab fishery. If the survey gets the nod by stakeholders in May, it will begin when the fishery opens in mid-August.Fish watchHerring seiners at Sitka Sound last week landed close to their 16,000 ton quota and roe counts were high. The only thing missing is a price. Lots of herring roe remains in the freezers of Alaska’s single customer – Japan, who had yet to make an advance price offer. Last year, Sitka fishermen averaged about $500/ton. Talk on the dock last week put it closer to $150 for this year.Conversely, freezers of sablefish (black cod) have emptied and pushed up prices for those prized fish. Seafood.com reports fishermen’s prices at Southeast Alaska at $5.25 for 5/7 pounders, $4.50 for 4/5s, and $3.75 for ¾ pound fish. Buyers report good interest in sablefish and more demand is coming from U.S. restaurants. Last year, about 70 percent of Alaska sablefish went to Japan, down from nearly 100 percent a few years ago.<COL>NOAA administrator Sobek to attend Kodiak’s ComFish<COL>2014-04-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/03/seafood-industry-moves-toward-head-to-tail-usage-for-fish/<COL>Seafood industry moves toward ‘head-to-tail’ usage for fishby Laine WelchCo-products is the big new buzz word in the seafood industry as more companies move toward “head-to-tail” usages for fish.“For instance, the oils we are producing now from pollock livers has become so valuable in capsules and other human nutraceutical products, it makes no sense to call the livers a “byproduct” of the fillets or surimi,” said Alex Oliveira, a food specialist at the Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science Center, a satellite campus of the UAF School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. “All of it is important in the puzzle of how to maximize the value of each fish caught.”Oliveira specializes in marine lipids (fats) and food-flavor chemistry. The pollock oil supplements she helped develop in partnership with American Seafoods Company are marketed under the 54°N label. Her research has also spawned powdered products made from pollock milt and roe that are popular in Asian markets. She also helped launch the first freeze-dried Alaska sockeye salmon bites for NASA astronauts.Now, armed with a grant from the Alaska pollock industry, Oliveira is rolling up her sleeves to turn pollock skins into pet treats.“It will be a nutritious, low-fat treat from a marine source, instead of land animal byproduct,” she said, adding that slice and skin roll-up products will be tested.It’s a lengthy process getting any new food item to market, for pets and people.“We have to know the nutritional values and shelf-life limitations; that it is not undergoing undesirable chemical changes over storage. And there has to be a process for production of a good, safe product,” Oliveira explained. “Plus, nobody wants a pet treat that crumbles all over the carpet and makes your house stink, or leaves your pet’s breath smelling like dead fish.”In a couple of years, the research will show which product has a better chance in the market. Then comes testing for acceptance by pets, and more importantly, their owners.“Pets are generally the easy ones — at least for dogs,” Oliveira said, “but the owner has to want to buy it.”Another Alaska pollock study underway at the center is measuring the freshness and nutritional values of every part of the fish the moment it is caught. That project also is funded by the Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center, which — since 2000 — has contributed $13 million toward research on North Pacific fisheries, habitat and marine mammals.Alaska food gurusAll foods need the same kinds of scientific scrutiny to make sure they are nutritious, tasty and safe-to-eat. Oliveira and her colleagues at the KSMSC are the only research specialists in Alaska to investigate the physical, microbiological and chemical makeups of food. Their stamp of approval also ensures that foods meet the stringent state and federal safety requirements for sale in the U.S. and abroad.Seafood plays a big role at the Kodiak-based center, but the research and testing done there applies to all Alaska food products: berries, fruit bars, candies, wild game or sauces.Any food producers can avail themselves of the center’s expertise and services; from a “mom-and-pop” shop to a major company. The KSMSC also houses Alaska’s only real-world, mini-processing plant for “up-to-your-elbows” testing and packaging of any food products. The staff also trains and mentors Alaska’s next generations of food scientists.     www.sfos.uaf.edu/ksmsc/Gettin’ jiggyFor the first time, the jig fleet can pull up a twofer in the state water fishery that’s just gotten underway in the Gulf of Alaska: pollock, along with their cod. Jigging for pollock has been open before in federal waters, but with little to no effort.“Currently, those federal pollock seasons occur in the winter or when the weather is poor. So this test fishery will provide them an opportunity during a period when they are actively fishing,” said Trent Hartill, a state groundfish biologist at Kodiak. “The jig fleet expressed a lot of interest in being able to have the extra opportunity to harvest pollock.”“This will give them a chance to determine how to catch pollock and at what levels,” added biologist Mark Stichert. “They can also test the market to see what the processor interest is in buying the fish during different times of the year.”“In Kodiak, pollock is harvested by trawl vessels and usually comes in at a couple specific times of the year at vary large volumes,” Stichert said. “So it might be unique for processors to buy smaller volumes of pollock delivered in a different sort of way.”Where they catch the pollock, when and how much is what the managers said they will be watching in the test fishery to see if it is viable.‘But watchBlustery weather kept most boats tied to the docks during the first week of the halibut fishery, but 65 deliveries brought in just over 400,000 pounds since the opener on March 8. Prices to fishermen topped $7/pound for 40-ups at Homer, $6.50 for all sizes at Southeast and in the $6 range at Kodiak. The prices are similar to the start of the season last year, when demand is high for the first fresh fish.<COL>Seafood industry moves toward ‘head-to-tail’ usage for fish<COL>2014-03-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/03/lenten-season-good-news-for-alaska-seafood-industry/<COL>Lenten season good news for Alaska seafood industryby Laine WelchLast Wednesday marked the start of Lent, a time of fasting, soul-searching and repentance for hundreds of millions of Christians around the world. And what the burst in the holiday sales season from Thanksgiving to Christmas means to retailers, Lent means the same to the seafood industry.The 40-day Lenten season, which this year runs from March 5 to Easter Sunday on April 20, dates back to the fourth century. It has been customary to forego meat ever since. While nearly all seafood enjoys a surge of interest during Lent, the most traditional items served are the so-called “whitefish” species, such as cod, pollock, flounder and halibut.Food Services of America reports that Ash Wednesday is the busiest day of the year for frozen seafood sales, and the six weeks following is the top-selling season for the entire year. (“Ash Wednesday” arose from the ritual of placing ashes from burned palm branches on the forehead to symbolize, “that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return.”)Overall, Americans ate more seafood during Lent in 2013 than in previous years, according to Nation’s Restaurant News. GrubHub, the nation’s top online and mobile food-ordering company that works with nearly 30,000 restaurants in 600 cities, said the number of people eating fish on Fridays increased by 20 percent during Lent last year since 2011.The Filet-O-Fish sandwich, which was launched by McDonald’s on Good Friday, is made with Alaska pollock. Sales top 300 million a year. Nearly 25 percent of fish sandwiches are sold during Lent. No matter what the seafood favorite, the long Lenten season is good news for Alaska, which provides nearly 60 percent of the wild-caught seafood to U.S. restaurants and grocery stores.Halibut’s hereAlaska longliners were ready to haul in the year’s first fresh halibut with the March 8 start of the fishery. Alaska’s halibut catch of roughly 19 million pounds is down about 11 percent. Sablefish, or black cod, also opens on March 8. That quota was reduced by 10 percent this year to just under 34 million pounds.Less overall fish might bump up dock prices, but it will take a week or so for markets to settle out. Buyer resistance to the high-priced fish came into play last year and sales started off slowly. The first fresh landings last year fetched $5.25-$5.75 at major ports, then dropped about a dollar in the first week. Likewise, starting sablefish prices were down by 40 percent, ranging from $3-$5 across five sizes.Price watch: Last year’s average Alaska fish prices were $5.06 per pound for halibut and $2.84 per pound for sablefish. That compares to $5.87 and $4.11 in 2012.Alaska fishermen provide more than 95 percent of our nation’s halibut, as well as more than 70 percent of the sablefish.Switching to herringThe upcoming roe herring harvest at Sitka Sound has been clipped to 16,333 tons, which is about 1,200 tons less than announced in December. State managers are already set to start aerial surveys for signs of the roe herring run. Herring managers also think the warm spring means the fish might show early at Togiak in Bristol Bay. That is Alaska’s largest herring fishery with a catch this year at nearly 28,000 tons.A push is gaining steam to use all of the herring — not just the female roe — instead of grinding it into fish meal. In Norway, herring is sold smoked, canned, pickled and more. Fishermen there get 47 cents a pound for their catch; that compares to $100 per ton at Togiak.A McDowell Group report showed that, if male herring from Togiak and Kodiak fisheries were made into frozen fillets, the wholesale value would approach $15 million.Bring ‘em backResearchers at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center are tops at the work they do; the center is the research arm of NOAA Fisheries. Their science forms the basis for setting Alaska fish quotas, running observer programs and tightening bycatch limits, to name just a few. But, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center is located in Seattle, and Juneau Mayor Merrill Sanford wants to bring those science jobs closer to the sources   they study.“There are other places in Southeast where some of these jobs could go, and there’s also Kodiak, which has a big fishing industry, where some of the jobs could go. We want to look at all of that,” he said at a recent meeting.Mayor Sanford created a task force to learn how those science jobs might be brought back to Alaska. Attracting more federal jobs to Juneau is an Assembly priority, he said, as well as lab techs and  research vessels“If we could move even a few to our own research centers in our own fisheries areas, I think it would be a big advantage to us,” he said.NOAA Fisheries has fewer than 200 researchers in Alaska, mostly in Juneau. The Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle lists more than 400 on the job. That’s a long commute to and from the fishing grounds.So how did the center end up there in the first place?“That is where the geographical distribution of the labor force developed around the time of statehood,” NOAA spokesperson Julie Speegle told KTOO in Juneau, “and it’s mostly just been maintained there.”The task force will reveal its findings in six months.Fish flash!Eileen Sobeck, the new director of NOAA Fisheries, will attend the ComFish trade show next month in Kodiak. U.S. Senator Mark Begich is bringing Sobeck to the event; it will be her first trip to Alaska. Senator Begich frequently attends ComFish and holds informal, open meetings with all comers.www.comfishalaska.com.<COL>Lenten season good news for Alaska seafood industry<COL>2014-03-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/06/arctic-fishery-highlighted/<COL>Arctic fishery highlightedBy Laine WelchA plan by Alaska fishery ‘overseers’ aims to put the brakes on commercial fishing in the Arctic until more is known about the region’s fish stocks and marine environment. Now it’s time for the public to weigh in.The Arctic Ocean is the earth’s smallest and least explored ocean. For Alaska, the Arctic waters straddle the North Slope, with the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea on either side of Barrow. The crown of ice in the Arctic is receding fast – in recent years even the Northwest Passage is navigable in late summer. The melting ice is unveiling all kinds of unexplored opportunities for resource development in this unexpected frontier, including fishing.After two years of tinkering, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council has given its unanimous stamp of approval to adopt a plan that strictly defines parameters before any fishing occurs in U.S. portions of the Arctic. The plan governs all fish and shellfish stocks in federal waters, meaning from three to 200 miles offshore. It does not affect Arctic subsistence fishing or hunting.Global environmental groups have applauded the NPFMC’s precautionary “look before you leap” approach to the Arctic.“This area is changing very rapidly, and we need to get a better understanding of how climate change and ocean acidification are going to affect U.S. Arctic waters,” said Dr. Chris Krenz, Arctic Project Manager for Oceana in Juneau. “We also need basic information about the ecosystem, including what are the abundances of fishable species. We don’t even have baseline information on that.”“We also need an understanding of how those interact in the ecosystem and how fisheries might affect the subsistence way of life,” Krenz added.  “So those are the big things that we really need to know in order to be able to manage that region sustainably.”The public has until July 27 to comment on the Arctic fishing plan, before it heads to the Secretary of Commerce for approval.

Contact is Sue Salveson, AK Sustainable Fisheries Division at NMFS in Juneau.More fish on the air – A new radio program is providing expanded fish news for the Bristol Bay region.  The Bristol Bay Fisheries Report is a weekly program produced by veteran newsman Mike Mason at KDLG in Dillingham.  (Hear it online at www.kdlg.org )"It’s a 20 minute program dedicated to commercial fishing, the industry, habitat issues, those kinds of things,” Mason said.The first program, for example, featured the “three H’s in the Bay: herring, halibut and Help Wanted.  Mason said he’s eager to hear fish stories from the communities.“One of the things I’m excited about is to hear the smaller, individual stories of fishermen and women. So if people have a particular idea or something that is exciting or new, I would love to hear about it.”The Bristol Bay Fishing Report will continue through July, thanks to funding by the fishermen’s Regional Seafood Development Association. After that, Mason said he may continue to provide coverage of fishery meetings in Anchorage for KDLG.“None of that has been squared away, but I am definitely interested in covering Bristol Bay issues that come up in the regulatory meetings in Anchorage,” he said, adding that he will also track Pebble Mine issues “as it relates to commercial fishing.”Meanwhile, it’s been a long, hard winter in southwest Alaska, Mason said, and everyone is still struggling with high prices for goods and services. But heading into the salmon season, he said the mood is ‘hopeful.’“A lot of people are hopeful that the salmon will cooperate this year and return as expected and that the price will be ok, and that some of the energy concerns might be slightly alleviated from what they were last year.   But everybody’s really cautious because everyone is working right on the edge of their margins to make it a go out here.”Price trends to watch- As usual the prices paid to Copper River salmon fishermen adjusted downwards after the opening hoopla in mid-May.    Prices for sockeye salmon, which were coming on strong, took a big hit going from $3.65.lb to $1.65/lb after the third opener last week. Chinook prices had dipped only slightly, going from $5.50/lb to $5/lb. Starting prices were down $1/lb for both kings and reds.Looking ahead to pink salmon: catch projections are pegged at 113 million pinks, an increase of 34% from last year.  And gone are the days when fishermen got a nickel a pound for pink salmon.Market watcher Ken Talley points out that since 2005 the demand for pink salmon roe, frozen and canned products has grown steadily. Average prices ranged from 12 to 16 cents in 2006, they ticked up to 17 cents in 2007, and last year pinks averaged 29 cents statewide. Talley said the upward trend could depend on the amount of credit banks will extend to seafood processors this summer for pink salmon ‘pack loans.’Snow crab shocker – Alaska crabbers and fishery managers were said to be “blindsided” by news that the feds want to slash Bering Sea snow crab catches by half through 2011.  Seafood.com reported that federal fish managers called the cuts a ‘stock rebuilding measure’ at the recent industry Crab Plan Team meeting in Seattle.“ADF&G and industry groups, such as the Alaska Crab Coalition (ACC), were both embarrassed and concerned about the NMFS’ proposal which came as a surprise,” the report said. Currently, Alaska snow crab catches are at 50 million pounds. A decision by fishery managers is expected by October.Free videos for top quality – A series of nine videos on improving salmon quality is available from Alaska Sea Grant’s Marine Advisory Program. Topics include boat setup, fishing practices, handling, chilling, dressing and pressure bleeding, unloading, and cleaning and sanitizing.“Amid a global economic recession and lingering high fuel prices, fishermen will have to catch and deliver the highest quality fish possible if they want to make money,” said ASG’s Doug Schneider.The videos are available for free online while supply lasts.

It is referred to as ocean acidification, and results in sea creatures’ inability to grow skeletons and protective shells. The process occurs much faster in colder climates.West coast scallops are the latest bivalves to feel the bite. The Parksville Qualicum Beach News reported that 10 million tiny scallops have died in waters off Victoria, British Columbia.Nanaimo-based Island Scallops, a grow-out hatchery with 1,235 acres in production, has shut down its processing plant and laid off a third of its workforce. That accounts for about 16 per cent of B.C.’s total shellfish aquaculture valued at $10 million.Island Scallops started seeing problems in 2009, along with other Washington hatcheries, said CEO Rob Saunders.“Suddenly, we were getting these low pH values,” Saunders told the News. “That level has been so stable that, for many years, no one bothered to measure it because it never changed. It was really startling.”Early last year, the company counted 3 million scallops seeded in 2010 and 7 million from 2011, and was gearing up for processing. But the shellfish started to die, and by July, the losses reached 95 per cent. Other local growers faced the same fate.“The high acidity in local waters interferes with everything they do; their basic physiology is affected,” said Chris Harley, marine ecologist at the University of B.C.Growers are artificially increasing the pH levels of the water that circulates through the hatcheries to protect the larvae, but that is little help to the shellfish once they are moved to the sea.The B.C. Shellfish Growers Association said the acidic ocean is increasingly affecting survival and growth of shellfish during grow out in the ocean, and that last year, mortalities reached 90 percent in all year classes.Pacific oysters also are one of the most vulnerable to ocean corrosion. In 2005, growers first noticed oyster failures in natural sets in Willapa Bay in southern Puget Sound. Production was off by 80 percent by 2009.“The oysters still grow a shell; it’s just that it dissolves from the outside faster than they can grow it,” said Bill Dewey of Taylor Shellfish Farms. “So eventually, they lose the race and they die.”Taylor Shellfish operates an 11,000-acre farm in Shelton, Wash., and  is the nation’s largest shellfish producer with 500 employees.Growers there have learned that wind direction tells them when to plug intake pipes to the shellfish holding tanks. When the wind shifts from south to north, they know they have about a 24-hour window before corrosive waters show up. Meanwhile, Taylor is planning to move more of its oyster operations to Hawaii.Closer to home, researchers are seeing signs of corrosion in tiny shrimp-like pteropods – which make up 45 percent of the diet of Alaska pink salmon.Carbon dioxide has passed 400 parts per million in the Earth’s atmosphere, according to measurements taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory. That’s up from 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era.Halibut helpHalibut researchers will test deeper and shallower water depths to get better data on the dwindling stocks, and more fishing boats are needed to help.Each summer, up to 15 boats are contracted to help halibut scientists survey 1,300 stations from Oregon to the Bering Sea. Since 1998, surveys have been in a depth range of 20 to 275 fathoms, where most fishing takes place. This year, they will check out different depths.“We use the area from zero to 400 fathoms as halibut habitat, but our surveys cover the area from 20 to 275 fathoms,” said Bruce Leaman, executive director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission.Leaman said researchers plan to expand the surveys from 275 to 400 fathoms and from 20 down to 10 fathoms along the Pacific Coast and in area 4A — the Bering Sea edge and eastern Aleutians region near Unalaska. There are four survey areas in that region, and each one contains 40-50 stations.Halibut stock surveys occur from late May through August, and take three to four weeks to complete. It’s a chance to make a good chunk of change, said survey manager Claude Dykstra. Typical payouts range between $70,000 to $120,000, depending on survey regions. Boats also get 10 percent of the halibut sales and 50 percent of any other fish retained and sold.Fixed-gear vessels using fixed gear can submit a proposal at www.iphc.int /Fish watchMarch 8 is opening day for halibut and sablefish, and fishing continues throughout Alaska for cod, flounder and other ground fish. In a few weeks, the jig fleet will be the first to take part in a new small-boat pollock fishery, and managers report lots of interest.Fish bits• The Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game will get a $2.5 million cut if recommendations by a House Finance Subcommittee are accepted by the full Legislature and approved by Gov.

That compares to $90,000 this past January.In Southeast Alaska, seine permits are the priciest in the state at more than $300,000. That’s an increase of $50,000 since January.The asking price for Prince William Sound seine cards exceeds $200,000, compared to the $140,000 range a year ago. After being stalled in the mid $30,000 range for years, Kodiak seine permits are showing a steady uptick, now listing at $55,000 to more than $80,000. Chignik permits are moving up from the $225,000 range, while Area M/Alaska Peninsula drift permits were listed at $100,000 — up from $90,000.Cook Inlet drift permits were listed at $100,000, up from $75,000 less than a year ago.Looking at Individual Fishing QuotasHalibut shares have hit a $50 asking price in Southeast Alaska; it’s the only place halibut catches have increased in the past two years.For the Central Gulf, asking prices for halibut IFQs range from $28 to $42 a pound, and $16 to $20 in the Western Gulf. That’s an increase of about $6 dollars in both gulf regions since January.Conversely, prices for shares of sablefish (black cod) show a big drop in price from a year ago. Asking prices in Southeast of $22 to just over $30 are down from $28 to $34 per pound. Likewise, Central Gulf sablefish shares are priced at $15 to $30, down from the same prices as Southeast.The decline is likely due to a big drop in dock prices for sablefish over the past two years; (after reaching a high of $9/lb for large fish). Also to blame is a 25 percent drop in the value of the yen in Japan, where the bulk of Alaska’s sablefish is sold, said Andy Wink, lead seafood analyst with the McDowell Group in Juneau.Get growing!A new Alaska Mariculture Initiative has a mission to create a plan “to grow a billion-dollar industry within 30 years.” That would about double the annual dockside value of all Alaska seafood landings combined.The ambitious project will be bankrolled by a $216,812 federal grant to the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. It’s one of 10 award recipients from a pool of 250 as part of NOAA Fisheries’ national mariculture expansion policy.“We see it as a real opportunity that has been kind of struggling in Alaska,” said AFDF director Julie Decker, adding that the project will “broaden the concept of mariculture.”Decker points out many parallels between the mariculture initiative and Alaska’s salmon-enhancement program, where the state backed a $100-million, low-interest, revolving loan fund so salmon hatcheries could get built and operate for several years. That gave them time to develop tax and cost-recovery programs to help pay back the long-term loans.“It helps people see conceptually that Alaska can do this,” she said. “Now we have hatcheries that have completely paid back those loans with interest, and are producing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of salmon every year.”Mariculture was approved by the Alaska Legislature in 1988. Today, 69 sites are permitted, but only 28 growers are marketing shellfish — primarily oysters — with an annual value of half a million dollars a year.Science made simpleNot all waters are created equal: Whales act as sentinels in  changing marine environments, salmon excluders for trawl fisheries, economics of killer whale predation. These are just a few topics people will learn about at next week’s Kodiak Area Marine Science Symposium.“This is a pretty unique gathering of folks who have been doing research in the Kodiak area that work for state, federal and academic entities,” said Kate Wynn, a marine mammal researcher at the Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science Center and co-organizer of the Sea Grant event. “They are all getting together and bringing their science back to the people of Kodiak.”Nearly 40 presentations are scheduled over four days,  with each presentation limited to 15 minutes, and five minutes for questions. Wynn said it is important for things to be presented in a way that anyone can understand.“Don’t overwhelm them with scientific details you might use in a scientific symposium to your peers,” she explained “These are school kids, guys off the street, tourists and others in the community who want to know what you’re talking about.”Alaska Sea Grant has hosted similar “lighter side of science” symposia in other Alaska communities to highlight local research. Wynn said the goal is to make science enjoyable and not to scare people away.“We’ve actually had discussions about even using the word science in the symposium name,” she said. “It can throw people off and be intimidating.”The KAMSS event runs from April 22- 26 at the Kodiak Convention Center.

According to the Associated Press, the money could “provide algae to nourish clam and oyster larvae along the Pacific coast, fill the bellies of tilapia in Arizona and feed catfish, trout and game fish in the Midwest and South.”Supporters  say the money will help preserve jobs in areas hard hit by the recession and lacking other industries.No mention of where the farmed fish feed will come from – currently, most is generated from the catches of species like Peruvian anchovies or menhaden. Using ground up wild fish to feed farmed fish is a practice that is quickly falling out of favor.Let’s hope that the feed purchasers will “go green” and “buy American” by sourcing some of that fish food from Alaska!Each year Alaska’s fisheries produce an estimated 1.25 million metric tons of “industrial wastes” from fish processing operations across the state, much of which is turned into meals and oils for aquaculture operations.“It’s the largest volume in North America,” said Dr. Peter Bechtel, a USDA research leader at the Univ. of Alaska/Fairbanks.A 2008 study for the Anchorage-based Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation (AFDF) by Dr. Anthony Bimbo estimates Alaska’s average fishmeal production at 217,000 tons from 2000-2007; there is no data available on production of salmon meal, and it is not known how much is sold domestically. Assuming a 5 year average price, Alaskan produced fish meal could have reached a value up to $170 million. Bimbo said it is difficult to quantify Alaska fish oil and meal production, because fisheries are divided between state and federal jurisdictions, and there are different databases.Ironically, Alaska spends $20 million each year on fish feed for its 35 salmon hatcheries – feed that comes from South America. At the same time, the tons of fish feed produced by Alaska seafood companies is sold to aquaculture operations in Asia.Find the study “Alaska Seafood Byproducts: Potential Products, Markets and Competing Products” at www.afdf.org.Lots going on besides salmon -  Salmon dominates the news at this time of year (96% of all U.S. salmon landings come from Alaska), but many other fisheries also occur during the summer.Alaska’s first king crab fishery of the year kicked off this month in Norton Sound near Nome, Dungeness crab seasons started throughout Southeast Alaska and Kodiak; in July scallop fisheries begin from Yakutat to Dutch Harbor; and the golden king crab season starts in August along the Aleutians. Meanwhile, all summer long Alaska fishermen will continue targeting halibut, cod and other groundfish, giant geoduck clams, sablefish, and many more from the Panhandle to the Bering Sea.How important are all these fisheries to Alaska? They provide nearly $6 billion worth of economic activity in the state, 78,000 direct and indirect jobs, and 80% of the manufacturing that goes on in Alaska is accountable to the seafood industry. The seafood industry provides more Alaska jobs than oil, gas and mining combined.Find more Alaska fishing facts in a user-friendly report called ‘The Seafood Industry in Alaska’s Economy’ by Northern Economics in Anchorage.Selenium stomps mercury –  More studies are showing that a naturally occurring mineral in marine fish called selenium is a major overlooked factor in the ongoing food safety debate over mercury and seafood.  Selenium is an essential nutrient that is required for a healthy brain and hormone producing tissues.  It also is credited with substantially reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, which stems from plaque build-up that destroys brain cells.Selenium is present in deep-water fish at five to 20 times the concentration of mercury. And when the two chemicals bind, methyl mercury appears to be neutralized.Research last year by Dr. Nicholas Ralston at the Univ. of North Dakota found that the most popular ocean fish eaten by Americans – including salmon, pollock, tuna and flounders – all contain much more selenium than mercury.  Out of 1,100 foods that have been analyzed for selenium by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, ocean fish comprised 17 of the 25 best dietary selenium sources. Now Ralston’s research has spawned a new approach to assessing the mercury risks in seafood.A study released last week claims that current federal methods for formulating seafood consumption guidelines may not provide an accurate assessment of food safety.“Since only mercury levels in fish are presently being assessed, evaluations of risk from ocean fish consumption are being overstated, and conversely, risks from eating fresh water fish from some locations may be much greater than is currently assumed,” Ralston told Seafood.com. “Since selenium and mercury occur together in seafood but affect health outcomes in opposing directions, it is essential to look at the balance of these elements present in fish.”The study examines a new seafood safety guideline known as the Selenium-Health Benefit Value (Se-HBV) that predicts risks or benefits based on their relative mercury and selenium contents. Because it considers both the health benefits of selenium as well as the risks of methyl mercury, the Se-HBV index provides far more accurate food safety predictions than current criteria which are based on mercury alone.The study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency.<COL>A little fish stimulus<COL>2009-06-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/08/%e2%80%98big-boy%e2%80%99-the-biggest-boat-hoist-comes-to-kodiak/<COL>‘Big Boy’ the biggest boat hoist comes to Kodiakby Laine WelchKodiak is now home to one of the biggest boat lifts in the world – and with it comes the promise of plenty of new jobs.The 600-ton, 54-foot-high hoist, built by Marine Travelift of Wisconsin is one of just five in the United States, and the only one in Alaska. It was shipped in 24 containers to Kodiak in June and assembled on the island. Since then, workers have been building the site for the boat lift adjacent to Kodiak’s larger harbor and preparing for the first test lifts next month.Kodiak is home to the state’s largest and most diverse fishing fleet with roughly 700 boats. However, big trawlers and crab boats have had to travel to Seward, Seattle or further for repairs and maintenance.“Right now, we can only lift boats up to 150 tons and that’s a stout 75 -80 footer,” said Kodiak harbormaster, Marty Owen who has been advocating for the new lift for 15 years. “We have lots of bigger boats up to 150 feet and 700 tons. The new lift is designed to lift boats up to 42 feet wide and 180 feet.”Every 18 months to two years, a boat must be pulled out to have its zincs checked, propellers tuned up, barnacles scraped off, new paint and other upkeep.“We call that a shave and a haircut, and that’s the basic boat maintenance you have to do,” Owen explained. “The fleet really gets tired of having to travel elsewhere just to get the basics done. With today’s fuel costs, running a boat to Seattle and back is a $25,000 to $30,000 bill.”The Kodiak boat lift is self-propelled, has a heated wash pad and can accommodate up to seven boats at a time. Owen said the boat lift will operate an “open yard,” meaning users can do the boat work themselves, or hire their own contractors.User fees will help repay the $18 million tab for the lift, which is owned by the City of Kodiak. The state contributed $2 million to the project, along with $2.3 million in federal economic development funds.That’s a big part of what the boat life project is all about, said Nick Szabo, Chairman of the Kodiak Port and Harbor Advisory Board.“Creating jobs and supporting the industry that Kodiak does best – catching and processing fish – was the rationale for building the boat yard,” Szabo said.There are 75 people on the job now, and the project will create many new jobs, Owen said.“Right now you can’t get a big propeller repaired in Kodiak. We have welders and mechanics, but not that many,” he said. “Every day I have craftsmen calling and asking when the lift will be done. Now that there will a lot more opportunities, these kind of skilled workers will be moving to Kodiak. I think the economic return to the community will be tenfold.”Owen said there are already 16 boats on the boat lift waiting list for service.

Three TAA programs have been funded again, under the U.S. Departments of Labor, Agriculture and Commerce.“Salmon pollock, crab – we can find imports coming in for just about any seafood, so therefore, they would qualify,” said  Gary Kuhar, director of the nonprofit Northwest TAA Center, which administers funds for the Commerce program in five states, including Alaska. “Our program focuses on helping the firm, and secondarily, saving jobs. We’re the only program that not only helps develop a strategic plan, we implement the plan for them,” he added. After a client has shown how his or her business has been hurt by foreign imports, NWTAAC will step in to handle all the paperwork and federal bureaucracy.“We have to show a 5-percent decline in sales or production, and a decline in employment and then be able to tie it into an increase in imports over the past three years,” Kuhar explained. “We also talk with former customers that are now buying a product or service from a foreign source.”The NWTAAC program is best-suited for medium-to-large businesses, but it is also open to co-ops, associations and individuals. Small companies can get grants up to $30,000; for large firms, the limit is $150,000. Both require some cost-sharing.“If your heart is set on buying equipment, we’re not the program for you. But if you’re interested in becoming more vertically integrated and taking over some of your own marketing efforts – we do a great job in creating brand identification, brochures and labels in multi languages, and Web site development.“It could be a fish-marketing firm that has lost sales of Alaska salmon, say, in Iowa to a foreign source like Chile, Canada or Norway,” Kuhar said. “We’ve helped a Southeast seiner develop an eco-tour business – they wanted to get out of the salmon industry, but had a nice 58-foot seiner and they didn’t know what to do with. Another salmon fisherman is now selling his canned pack in Eastern Europe. We’ve designed a small hydroelectric dam for a sheep rancher in Idaho. He’s now generating over a quarter million dollars a year in electricity, and using it to keep his sheep operation going. We’re really only limited by our imaginations.”Get more info at www.NWTAAC.org or contact gary@nwtaac.org.Center of the plateLast year was tough for all the proteins that compete for the center of America’s dinner plates. Per capita seafood consumption fell to 16 pounds, a drop of 1.8 percent from 2007. Still, that ranks as the fifth-highest level ever – and market analyst Ken Talley said the industry “did a decent job of playing defense in a tough economy.”Seafood wasn’t the only item that took a hit. Global recession, combined with less disposable income and lower supplies took a bite out of meat and poultry sales as well. Chicken consumption also dropped by nearly two percent, while prices rose 5.1 percent. Americans ate 59.3 pounds of chicken per person in 2008. Seafood eaters did top turkey, which had a consumption level of 13.9 pounds per person. Shoppers paid 4.7 percent more for turkey last year, and 6 percent more for seafood.Pork consumption decreased 2.5 percent to 46.5 pounds per capita. Pork prices last year rose 2.3 percent.By far, beef is still “what’s for dinner” – although it, too, took a dip. Beef consumption dropped 4 percent, while reduced supplies pushed prices up 4.5 percent. And while that may have kept many away from the meat counter, Americans still ate 59.9 pounds of beef in 2008.As for this year, Talley points out that many of the trends that drove the  lower eating levels remain in play. On the bright side, U.S. economists believe the “recessionary free-fall” appears to be slowing.<COL>‘Big Boy’ the biggest boat hoist comes to Kodiak<COL>2009-08-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/06/crab-for-the-masses/<COL>Crab for the massesby Laine WelchThe summer survey of Bering Sea crab stocks just got underway – and a lot is riding on the results. Notably, the data collected over the next two months will dictate if Alaska’s snow crab catch will be slashed this winter.Federal fishery scientists have recommended a snow crab harvest limit at 16 million pounds, down from nearly 60 million pounds last year. Industry stakeholders had hoped for a similar catch level for the 2009/2010 season.The decrease is not due to the snow crab stocks being in imminent danger of collapse; rather their numbers are not reaching a set target on time, as defined by a rebuilding plan. Snow crab stocks in the Bering Sea were classified as ‘overfished ‘in 1999, when estimates went from 290 million pounds to 25 million, seemingly in a single year. By law, fishery managers were required to devise a rebuilding plan with a time frame of 10 years. ?“So the snow crab fishery has been managed under this rebuilding plan since 2000  and 2010 is the target date to accomplish that,” explained  Doug Pengilly, research coordinator for the westward region at ADF&G in Kodiak. (The state co-manages the Bering Sea crab fisheries with the feds.)The snow crab biomass needs to reach 317 million pounds to be considered ‘rebuilt’. It’s estimated  at 260 million pounds now. But at the current rate of fishing, the stocks won’t reach the target on time.“In May, the assessment biologists projected that if we were to try to achieve a 50% probability of being rebuilt (to 317 million pounds), the 2010 harvest may have to be in the order of 16 million pounds,  rather than 50 million pounds,”  Pengilly said.The results of the  Bering Sea crab survey, will tell the tale.“Part of this projection is based on a guess at what might be occurring in this survey, and that guess could be wrong,” Pengilly said. “So the situation could change – for better or worse.” Snow crab, or opilio Tanner, is Alaska’s largest crab fishery, valued last year at $100 million at the docks.Togiak herring tanks – Alaska’s biggest roe herring fishery at Togiak in Bristol Bay was a bit of a bust. The fishery began on May 16 and ended after 10 days of short openers, most lasting less than  30 minutes.“Every year is different, but this year was more different than most,” said Tim Sands, regional fishery manager at ADF&G in Dillingham. ?            The Togiak herring were late, small and showed up all at once, Sand said, adding that the bulk “spawned and quickly left.”  Only about two days yielded the larger fish typical at Togiak, Sands said, and then average weights dropped off sharply.In a déjà vu of last year’s Bristol Bay sockeye salmon run, processers were unable to keep up with the peak of the herring catch, meaning lots of roe herring went unharvested. ?“It was pretty disappointing to be on the fish and not able to take it,” said Isaac Milligan aboard the F/V Gallant Girl. “But it was a fun fishery and it’s a great boat and we did ok overall.” ? Managers estimated the seiners missed about 2,400 tons out of their 15,000 ton quota. Fishing also was scratchy for  gillnetters who took 3,803 tons, or 60% of their herring quotaSands said he hadn’t heard too much grumbling yet about the so-called foregone harvest.“We didn’t take all the quota so by definition that is foregone harvest. And it is all at the door of the processors – if they could have processed more they could have taken more,” he said. “But on the other hand, if the processors that are coming here are barely making any money now, how are you going to make them bring in more capacity?”Twenty-two seiners and 32 gillnetters participated in the Togiak Fishery this year, up slightly. Sands estimates the total Togiak herring harvest at 16,500, well below the 21,000 tons projected.  The advance price is likely to average $125 per ton, similar to last year.“With so much less fish taken, it might help the price, but on the down side, the roe percentage is much worse than we usually see,” Sands said.The herring are valued for their roe, which is a prized delicacy in Asian markets. The roe percentage for the Togiak fish barely topped the 10% baseline.Kodiak kicks off – Kodiak’s salmon fishery is set to begin on June 9 but early sockeye runs appear to be a bit behind schedule.“We can’t really tell if it’s weak or not, but it seems to be about five days late,” said regional manager Jeff Wadle.The Kodiak forecast of 1.5 million reds is down from last year’s catch of 1.8 million. Projections also call for a catch of 421,500 coho salmon and 623,000 chums. A bumper run of pink salmon is expected to boost Kodiak’s catches to 22 million, compared to 8.7 million humpies last year.Wadle said the increased pink catches might attract more fishing interest, which dwindled last year to just 227 participants, 45.6% of Kodiak’s salmon permit holders (148 setnetters and 129 seiners).“We won’t really know if we have an increase in effort probably until July when pink salmon starts,” Wadle explained.   “I think the prices are going to be similar to last year, so we might see some increase in seiners this year, hopefully.”Kodiak pink salmon prices to fishermen last year averaged 30 cents a pound, up a dime from 2007. For sockeye, the average price was $1.17/lb (up from one dollar); the coho price was $1.11/lb (compared to 60 cents); and 47 cent for chums, which averaged 35 cents a pound in 2007.Kodiak’s salmon fishery was valued at $27.87 million at the docks last year, compared to the 10 year average of $24.32 million. Seiners accounted for 83% of the catch and averaged $164,644 per permit fished, compared to the 10 year average of $109,266. Kodiak set gillnetters accounted for 16.9% of the island’s salmon harvest in 2008, with average earnings of $43,187 per fished permit. The 10 year average was $38,427 for setnetters.Fish Fact – The commercial fishermen of Bristol Bay set sail on their 125th season on June 7.<COL>Crab for the masses<COL>2009-06-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/04/overall-alaska-salmon-forecast-down-for-2014/<COL>Overall Alaska salmon forecast down for 2014by Laine WelchAlaska’s total salmon catch for 2014 is projected to be down by almost half of last year’s record haul.State fishery managers are calling for an all species harvest of just under 133 million salmon, a 47% drop from last year’s whopping 283 million fish.A pink catch of 95 million pushed the record last year and it is pinks that will bring the numbers down this summer.Pink salmon run in on/off year cycles and this year the catch is pegged at about 75 million, a 67 percent decrease from last summer’s 226 million humpy haul.Other projected catches for this year call for a 14 percent increase in sockeyes to nearly 34 million; 4.4 million coho salmon, and nearly 20 million chums. For Chinook salmon, a catch of 79,000 is projected in areas outside of Southeast and Bristol Bay.Along with the salmon forecasts, the annual report released last week by the state Commercial Fisheries Division also provides recaps of the 2013 season for every Alaska region.(All values are dock prices and will increase when post-season sales bonuses and other adjustments are made.)Some highlights:A total of 1,917 permit holders participated in Alaska’s salmon fisheries last year, an increase of 1 percent over 2012. The preliminary value of $238 million is the highest since 1985.The proportional harvest composition by species was  less than 1 percent Chinook, 1 percent sockeye, 3 percent coho, 84 percent pinkand 11 percent chum salmon.Southeast Alaska fishermen again caught the most salmon at 112 million, the most since 1962, and 218 percent of the recent 10-year average. The exvessel (dockside) value of $238 million was the highest since 1985.Prince William Sound’s salmon harvest barely missed 100 million fish – all but about 7 million were pink salmon.At Upper Cook Inlet, the catch of 3.1 million salmon was down 23 percent from the 10 year average, but high sockeye prices pushed the value to $39 million, the eighth highest value since 1960, and the second highest in a decade.The Bristol Bay total harvest was 16.4 million salmon, valued at $141 million, 26 percent above the 20-year average and seventh over that same period.At the Kuskokwim region, 469 permit holders went fishing last summer and took home $2.4 million at the docks. The overall chum run at Kotzebue Sound was well above averageFor the 6th year in a row, there was no fishing for king salmon in the main stem of the Yukon and Tanana Rivers. Many of the 467 fishermen had great success targeting chums with dip nets for a dockside value of $3.5 million.At Norton Sound 124 salmon fishermen brought in the highest chum salmon harvest in over 25 years. For three of the past four years, the value has topped $1 million.At Kotzebue, 66 permit holders sold 2.5 million pounds of chumsalmon, down 20 percent. A 15% drop in chum prices to $.27/lb likely caused less interest in the fishery. The dockside value of $689,163 was 16 percent above the historical average.The $23.3 million value of the Chignik salmon fishery was worth $307,076 on average among the 77 permit holders. At the Alaska Peninsula/False Pass, 150 fishermen shared a payday of $33 million.At Kodiak, 335 (55 percent) of theeligiblesalmon permits fished last year for a catch that topped 59 million, the highest since 1995. It paid out well above the previous average 10-year value of $28.3 million. Seiners accounted for 94 percent of the total Kodiak harvest with earnings averaging $304,105 per permit.Fish to Schools – A push by Sitkans is aimed at getting more local seafood onto Alaska kids’ school lunch trays.A Fish to Schools Resource Guide created by the Sitka Conservation Society is a sort of “tool kit” that outlines procuring and preparing seafood, legalities, tips and recipes. The idea was spawned two years ago at a Sitka Health Summit,a grass roots effort sponsored by the community’s two hospitals, said Tracy Gagnon, Community Sustainability Organizer for the Society and program coordinator.“The Fish to Schools Program tries to integrate the community into every part of the process,” Gagnon said. “It gets our fishermen and processors involved, our schools and children and parents, community members…I really think that’s what makes ours so successful.”To help make students more aware of where their food comes, the guide includes a seven lesson ‘Stream to Plate’ curriculum.“It really brings salmon to life in the classroom and teaches students how the fish are connected to their lives, the community, the economy and the environment. That is something unique to our Sitka program,” she said, adding that salmon is served once a week at most Sitka schools.Prior to this year, over 23 local fishermen and Sitka processors donated the seafood to the schools – but now they can be paid, thanks to a $3 million funding grant from the state.“It’s called ‘Nutritional Alaska Food for Schools’ (NAFS) and it’s a fabulous statewide appropriation that reimburses school districts for their Alaska food purchases, including seafood,” Gagnon said. (Credit Rep. Bill Stoltz (R-Chugiak.)Food for Schools money is in the FY15 capital budget and Gagnon hopes it becomes a fixed item.“We are really hoping to see multi-year funding so schools have the ability to invest in infrastructure development so that they canprocess raw products,” Gagnon said. She added that the US school lunch program has moved away from scratch cooking and most meals are heat and serve, highly processed products.“We are really limited on how schools can prepare food. Some have convection ovens so you can bake fish.”and that’s how all of our fish recipes have been so far.But we don’t have skillets or frying pans,” she explained.“I think that’s one of the successes from this program is that we are breaking that habit. We are changing the current system and integrating local seafood that is prepared from scratch.So that is a really cool hurdle we’ve accomplished.”The Food to Schools program also is a boom to Alaskan growers and fishermen because they are able to have secure in-state markets.Seafood purchases through NAFS last year totaled $137,176 pounds by 25 Alaska schools or districts, led by Anchorage, Kenai and Kodiak. Sitkans hope their Fish to Schools guide book will motivate others to come aboard. www.sitkawild.org<COL>Overall Alaska salmon forecast down for 2014<COL>2014-04-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/07/run-of-reds-may-bring-limits/<COL>Run of reds may bring limitsBy Laine WelchSalmon fishermen at Bristol Bay were bracing for another surge of reds over the July 4 weekend – and likely more trip limits.The peak of the sockeye run is on its way, said Susie Jenkins on Friday. Jenkins is a “company liaison” at the ADF&G office in Dillingham, where she is in daily contact with fishermen and processors.“It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when they’ll be here, but the big push of the run is yet to come,” she said.The second pulse of fish gives processing crews barely enough time to catch their breath after last week’s huge haul of 10 million reds, taken throughout the Bay in about three days.  The major processing companies were unable to handle the plug of fish, and on June 28 they put fishermen on catch limits, the earliest date ever; some suspended buying altogether.“What a way to start off the season – on trip limits,” scoffed a lifelong Bay fisherman who asked to remain anonymous. “And it looks like we’ll end the season on limits too.”The first run of sockeye salmon arrived several days early and seemed to catch some processors off guard, Jenkins concedes, plus “all the bays were hitting at the same time, so they were getting it from all sides.”But that’s no excuse, Jenkins bluntly asserts, pointing to the availability of information and daily communications between managers, processors and fishing fleets.“The fishermen are angry. All winter long we’ve been told the processors have the capacity to handle large runs. The fishermen have been told they are going to work hard to keep them off limits and bring more tenders into the bay. This is the sixth season in a row that they’ve gone on limits, and they’ve been caught unprepared.“When this peak comes, this is the time for these guys to make money. This is the time for them to catch fish. And the bulk of the run is going past their nets and they’re only allowed to catch 4,000 pounds? They can catch that in an hour,” Jenkins said.A study last year by the Juneau-based McDowell Group found that 37 million fish worth $131 million to fishermen went unharvested at Bristol Bay in the past five years.  In 2009 that number is still climbing.In the 2009 annual processor survey, 13 companies said they had capacity to handle the projected catch of 24 million sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay this summer. A three percent boost in tendering capacity was also added to haul excess fish to other plants at King Cove and Kodiak. But it still doesn’t seem to be enough, agreed Cora Crome, fisheries aide to the Governor.“We have a consistent pattern in the Bay where it’s clear that there is a need out there for a little bit more processing right at the peak,” Crome said last year after a ‘foregone harvest’ of three million harvestable red salmon swam away upstream.Fishermen for years have urged the state to allow foreign companies to come into the Bay to pull up the processing slack. Senator Lisa Murkowski, who was visiting Dillingham last week, posed that question to Tom Winihan, manager at Peter Pan Seafoods.“My personal opinion,” Winihan told KDLG, “ is that if we allow foreigners to come in and process they should have to adhere to all the same regulations that we do, the same hiring and wage standards, bonding standards for paying fishermen – if they do that, great, we will compete with them.  But they won’t do that, so we can’t compete with them.”“Everyone is frustrated,” said Susie Jenkins. “When their fishermen are unhappy it’s hard to have a good working relationship.  It’s tough on all the managers…But nothing has been done to remedy the situation and it just reverberates to everybody.”Meanwhile, a fleet of 1,300 drift gillnetters are participating in the Bristol Bay salmon fishery, similar to last year. Ditto the advance sockeye prices of 62-68 cents a pound.Safety laws looming?Congress is poised to put tough new laws on the books aimed at improving safety on U.S. fishing boats. It would be first big overhaul of the nation’s commercial fishing safety laws in more than 20 years.  According to the Seattle Times, the proposed rules would require extensive new construction and equipment standards for fishing boats as small as 50 feet.  Boats would need a so called ‘stability letter’ from a maritime classification society outlining safe operation. Safety training for skippers would be mandatory, and Coast Guard vessel inspections, now voluntary, would be required every other year.Although fishing related deaths have dropped significantly, the industry still has the highest on the job fatality rate – more than 25 times the national average. According to the Coast Guard, 55 percent of the 934 U.S. fishing deaths from 1992-2007  were from vessels flooding, capsizing or sinking. Vessels between 50 and 79 feet had the highest loss rates in the entire U.S. fishing fleet.  However, current rules don’t require any naval architects to approve construction or safe operating guidelines for boats of that size.The legislation has been under development for more than two years, the Times said, and is expected to go to the full House for a vote this summer. The bill has yet to encounter any major opposition.Real fishing blog- Most blogs are aimed at providing news and opinions, a nd there are lots of sites that offer seafood for sale. A new Kodiak blog gives a real glimpse of  the fishing life by taking viewers out to the docks, into fish holds and through aprocessing plant.“I really wanted to emphasize our direct access to the resource. It’s what sets us apart from other online seafood retailers,” said Ian Whiddon, producer of “Today’s Catch: Fresh news from Kodiak’s waterfront.”  Whiddon also is co-manager at Island Seafoods, a fish market and processing plant that is part of the Pacific Seafood Group.“I have a personal relationship with the fishermen and the crews on the boat. We see the fish from the boat, taken from the boat holds and put up in boxes and out the door,” he added. “Supermarkets and big chain stores are so anonymous. I wanted to put a face to the product that is being served to your family.”It’s Whiddon’s fishing photos that really let people connect to the seafood they’re eating – and the folks who are catching it. Today’s Catch also includes ‘show and tell’ recipes and gives a real taste of a day in the life of fishing the busy Kodiak waterfront.

The tax is collected by the Dept. of Revenue and the money is disbursed back to the RSDA each year. It can be used for marketing, infrastructure, ice barges, new products – whatever the fishermen want.  RSDAs also give fishermen more access to federal and state grants and programs.Ballots were sent in May to 475 Southeast drift gillnet permit holders asking if they approved a one percent self-tax to fund the association.  The state released the results last week — of 212 votes, 60% voted no (132/80).  Two years ago, a similar RSDA effort lost by two votes.“I guess the majority just don’t want it. I’m surprised it lost by such a wide margin,” said a disappointed John Jensen of Petersburg, an interim RSDA board member  working to get the RSDA off the ground.“It is too bad that these guys don’t realize they need to think beyond Southeast Alaska, and  that they are competing with a much wider market,” said Richard Mullins, marketing manager at Orca Bay Seafoods.  “They used to think they were competing with other areas of Alaska, now they are competing town by town. Their competition is more than Alaska, and even more than Atlantic salmon – it is center of the plate proteins!”Part of the difficulty stems from the vastness of the fishing region, said interim program director Elizabeth Dubovsky.“The geographic expanse of Southeast Alaska is one of the things that make it such a unique region. It’s a blessing in some ways, and in other ways it’s a challenge,” she said. “Especially when you’re trying to bring all these fishermen together under one group, and then you bring money into the picture, and that makes it even more challenging.”John Jensen agreed.“I know from talking with people that there’s a lot of apprehension that one community would get more of the money than others, and wouldn’t be treated fairly.  For example, Petersburg has the largest gillnet fleet, and I think people were worried about that,” he explained.The tax would only amount to a few hundred dollars each year, pointed out board member Keith Anundi, a Wrangell fisherman who initially opposed the RSDA.“I now believe it would substantially increase profitability for gillnet fishermen in Southeast Alaska,” Anundi said, adding that fishermen would elect a board with representation from all districts.Is a third time the charm for Rainforest Wild?Right now, everyone is focusing on fishing, Dubovsky said.“We will reconvene in the fall and decide how to proceed.  Our enthusiasm has not waned.”Southeast crabbers and shrimpers also are interesting in snapping up the RSDA opportunity, she said. Alaska fishermen have funded RSDAs in two regions so far – Copper River/Prince William Sound and Bristol Bay (where a 1% RSDA tax yields more than $1 million each year).Down on the (salmon) farm – Wild Alaska salmon  faces stiff competition from farmed fish, delivered as fresh, glistening fillets to restaurants and retailers year round.     Alaska is poised to benefit from worsening misfortunes in Chile, the largest supplier of farmed salmon to the U.S.             For a year now, Chilean fish farmers have been battling outbreaks of an infectious virus in their fish plugged pens, and salmon production is expected to drop 60% this year.“That has helped to keep the salmon market somewhat stronger than it might have been if the Chileans had been producing as much as people expected them to,” said fisheries economist Gunnar Knapp at the University of Alaska/Anchorage.Chilean fish farmers also are being widely criticized for using ‘hair raising’ amounts of antibiotics to curtail disease outbreaks, according to Intrafish. The FDA recently discovered three chemicals in Chilean farmed salmon that are banned in the U.S., including a pesticide that kills sea lice.Meanwhile, to make up for the salmon shortfall, buyers are switching to other suppliers, notably Norway.   Norway increased its supply of fresh salmon fillets to the U.S. by more than 13 million pounds from January through May, valued at $50.8 million.Price watch – The average price paid to Alaska salmon fishermen in 2008 was 58 cents a pound, an increase of   32% and the highest dockside value in recent memory.Salmon fishermen got higher prices last year for every species, except sockeye. Average Chinook prices went from a $3.07/lb. in 2007 to $4.28/lb.Cohos increased from $.96/lb. to $1.21. Chums went from $.34/lb. to $.53/lb. Pinks went up a dime, to average $.29/lb.Sockeye salmon fell from $.80/lb. in 2007 to $.78/lb in 2008. (Word on the docks says the base sockeye price at Bristol Bay has notched up to 70 cents this year.)Thoughts on Arctic fishing? A plan by Alaska fishery  overseers puts the brakes on commercial fishing in the Arctic until more is known about the stocks and dmarine environment. For Alaska, the Arctic waters straddle the North Slope, with the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.

The landings were down from 777 million pounds in 2007.Ports in Virginia and Louisiana pushed Kodiak down a peg to fifth place with seafood landings at 251 million pounds, a drop from 320 million in 2007.In terms of value of the catch, New Bedford, Mass. claimed the top spot for the 9th year running, topping $241 million at the docks, mostly due to pricey scallops.  Dutch Harbor ranked second at $195 million (up from $126 million), and Kodiak held on to 3rd place with landings valued at $98.7 million (down from $126 million in 2007).Other Alaska ports making the top 10 for landing values were Naknek/King Salmon ($65.3 million) and Cordova ($50.4 million).  Sitka ranked 13, Petersburg 26, Ketchikan 28, Seward 33, and Juneau at 46. (Interestingly, Homer is not on the list of US ports).In all, U.S. fishermen landed 8.3 billion pounds of seafood last year (down 11 percent), valued at $192 million (a 5 percent increase.)The average price paid to U.S. fishermen for their catches last year was 53 cents, compared to 45 cents in 2007. The price for fish increased by 57 percent; and 8 percent for shellfish.

Johnson.Shrimp is still America’s favorite followed by canned tuna – consumption was up slightly for both. Salmon held on to 3, followed by Alaska pollock, tilapia, catfish, crabs and cod.Americans ate 16 pounds of seafood per person last year, a drop from 16.3 pounds in 2007 and a decrease for the third year in a row.Salmon and pollock took the biggest hits on America’s dinner plates. Per capita salmon consumption of 1.84 pounds fell 22 percent between 2007 and 2008. For Alaska pollock, consumption of 1.34 pounds reflects a 23% drop from last year.“That reflects a rise in prices for salmon due to shortages in farmed fish from Chile – that’s had a big impact on retail sales,” said market analyst John Sackton in an analysis at www.seafood.com.   “For pollock, it likely reflects lower catches boosting the prices for both fillet and surimi products.”Other notables  – for the first time since 2000, Americans ate less crab and crab meat, falling by 10 percent (also likely due to higher prices). Tilapia –primarily from Chinese fish farms – is one of the few seafood items to show steady increases. U.S. consumption of tilapia has increased 242 percent since 2001. Sackton predicts for 2009 that crab and cod consumption will increase, pollock and salmon consumption will continue to decline, and that shrimp and tuna eating trends will be fairly stable.Some math stinks! Some fishy math is being used by activists to pump up mercury levels and scare people away from eating seafood.This year the Food & Drug Administration  cautioned that the ‘risk only’ approach in federal guidelines may have a negative impact on public health by discouraging fish consumption, especially by young mothers and babies.To bring balance to the dispute, the Center for Consumer Freedom has launched an online calculator that quickly computes risk and benefits for America’s seafood favorites, based on government guidelines.Simply put in your weight, choose a seafood and portion size. Select wild salmon, for example — put in 130 pounds and an 8 oz. portion – you’ll see the lineup of omega 3s, protein, iron, etc. – and that you would have to eat seven pounds of salmon per week for the rest of your life in order to face risks from mercury. You’d have to eat 24 pounds of pollock each week, and 10.3 pounds of codfish. For canned albacore tuna, risk begins at an intake of 2.7 pounds per week; 8.3 pounds for light tuna.The nonprofit Center for Consumer Freedom calls fish a superfood, and says “the entire medical literature contains zero cases of fetal mercury poisoning related to eating fish – but it is full of evidence that fish is a healthy food.”www.HowMuchFish.com<COL>Dutch Harbor retains top fishing port title<COL>2009-07-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/01/the-deep-of-winter-is-alaskas-true-fishing-season/<COL>The deep of winter is Alaska’s true ‘fishing season’By Laine WelchSalmon will always be the heart of Alaska fisheries. That’s why many people think of summer as, “the fishing season.” But that’s not the case.The deep of winter is when Alaska’s largest fisheries get underway each year. On Jan. 1, hundreds of boats with hook and line gear or big pots will begin plying the waters of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska for Pacific cod, rockfish and other groundfish.Then, on Jan. 20, trawlers take to the seas to target Alaska pollock, the world’s largest food fishery with harvests near 3 billion pounds. Crab boats hunt for golden kings along the Aleutians and snow crab in the Bering Sea, Alaska’s largest crab fishery.Early March sees the start of the 8-month long halibut and sablefish seasons. March also marks the beginning of Alaska’s roe herring circuit at Sitka Sound, and those fisheries continue for several months all the way up the coast to Norton Sound.And while fresh Alaska king salmon is available from Southeast trollers nearly year-round, mid-May marks the official start of Alaska’s salmon season with the runs of kings and reds on the Copper River. Salmon fisheries take center stage all summer and into the fall.Mid-October brings another of Alaska’s fishing highlights: red king crab from Bristol Bay.And so it goes, on through the end of each year, along with too many other fisheries to name.Crab updatesSoutheast crabbers ended one of their best fall/winter Dungeness fisheries ever. The fishery, which began in October, produced 1 million pounds for the season, even with less gear on the grounds.“The last two years, the catch has come in at half that,” said Adam Messmer, state assistant shellfish manager for Southeast. He added that 87 permits fished for fall dungies. The price averaged $2.53 a pound, similar to last year, bringing the value of the catch to more than  $2.5 million.The Dungeness harvest from the fall and summer fisheries totaled 2.6 million pounds, well above expectations.In the Bering Sea, snow crab pots are being dropped earlier than usual. The fishery traditionally gets going in mid-January, but is starting early for two reasons: crabbers want to avoid getting closed out by sea ice;  and strong demand for less crab is pushing the highest prices ever.Contract prices for snow crab on its way to Japan were reported at $5.50 to $5.60 for smaller sizes and $6.10 for large crab. Alaska’s total catch is 54 million pounds, down 20 percent from last year. Prices to crabbers were still being negotiated, said Jake Jacobsen of the Inter-Cooperative Exchange, a trade group.Fish shotsYour fishing photographs could help promote Alaska seafood around the world.

Owners of tackle businesses will be asked to, “characterize and quantify their operational costs and sales revenue, in addition to describing their clientele.”Seafood processors will be asked for “plant characteristics, plant ownership, operating costs, capital costs, labor and revenue.”<COL>The deep of winter is Alaska’s true ‘fishing season’<COL>2014-01-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2009/08/alaska%e2%80%99s-2009-salmon-season-seems-a-bust/<COL>Alaska’s 2009 salmon season seems a bustby Laine WelchThere’s still quite a bit of fishing to go, but it appears likely that Alaska’s 2009 salmon season will come up way short of the forecast.The statewide harvest was projected to reach 175 million fish, up 20 percent over last year. The boost stemmed from an anticipated 34 percent higher catch of pink salmon to 113 million fish. But so far, that hasn’t panned out.The biggest shortfall stems from an apparent run failure at one of the prime pink producing regions – Prince William Sound – where hatchery returns by last week were a total bust. Up to 40 million humpies were projected to be taken there this summer; through the first week of August, the catch was just 3.9 million fish.Good pink salmon catches were coming in at Kodiak and the Alaska Peninsula, but another big producer – Southeast – was also off to a slow start. The total statewide harvest of pinks through August 7 had reached 37 million fish.Catches of the big money fish – sockeye salmon – already topped 40 million, thanks to the huge haul of 30 million reds at Bristol Bay. Red salmon harvests in most other regions have been disappointing, but the total catch of nearly 40.7 million reds has surpassed the pre-season forecast of 38 million.Chum harvests are also running behind, with Southeast producing only about half of what was expected. The chum catch had reached 12.2 million so far, out of a projected 18.5 million fish. Bruce said that, except for Norton Sound, chum runs out west have been pretty good.The bulk of the coho catches are still to come throughout the state. The harvest so far had reached 1.3 million out of a projected 4.6 million silvers, a slight increase from last year. King salmon catches of 272,000 are slightly above the forecast of 249,000, mostly from Southeast (190,000 kings).Through early August, the statewide salmon catch had reached 91.5 million fish. Bruce agreed it’s a stretch that the 2009 harvest will reach the projected 175 million.“Of that, 113 million were pinks. Subtract the Prince William Sound portion, and it knocks it back to 70 to 80 million fish,” he said. “But it’s still kind of up in the air. The next couple of weeks will tell the tale.”Eco-codAll of Alaska’s Pacific cod fisheries are the next to merit an eco-label by the international Marine Stewardship Council. The bright blue MSC label assures customers that their seafood purchases come from fisheries that are managed for sustainability, and are friendly to the environment. www.msc.org“We’re within a month or two of completion,” said Jim Browning, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation which has spearheaded the labeling effort along with industry stakeholders. “This will be posted by the MSC on their public comment section this week.”The MSC program provides a way for consumers to support and reward responsibly managed fisheries. A chain-of-custody certification assures traceability of the seafood product from deck to dinner plate. Fisheries undergo a rigorous third party before obtaining the label; the process can be costly and take several years. But in today’s planet-conscious climate, eco-labels are becoming a part of doing business. Wal-Mart, for example, will only source seafoods bearing the MSC guarantee and more companies around the world have followed suit.And Browning said they are willing to pay more for it.“Depending on the market, people are certainly seeing a premium,” Browning said. “But more importantly, it’s not so much will you pay me more for certified cod – it’s we won’t take it unless it’s certified.”A portion of the Bering Sea freezer/longline fleet, owned by Bering Sea Select, obtained the MSC label for its cod catches in 2006 on its own dime. Now the eco-guarantee will apply to all Alaska cod fisheries, assuming all goes according to plan.“It includes four gear types: longline, trawl, pot and jig fisheries in both the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and the Gulf of Alaska,” Browning explained. “Each sector is looked at separately, so it’s eight separate certifications.”The MSC cod certification process has taken three years and cost $240,000, paid for with federal funding and industry stakeholders.Alaska’s P-Cod will be in good company – salmon, pollock, halibut and sablefish already bear the MSC label, and crab and flatfish are in the pipeline.“Right now, the industry tells us it’s the most bang for the buck as far as global recognition and control of certified products,” Browning said.www.afdf.orgFish equal jobsSeven seafood companies are among Alaska’s top employers, according the Dept. of Labor’s annual Top 100 list for 2008.Trident Seafoods ranked No. 6 and led all other seafood companies in terms of putting people to work. Trident is the largest employer in three of Alaska’s 29 boroughs and census areas – Aleutians East, Dillingham and Kodiak. Its largest plant is at Akutan.UniSea in Dutch Harbor, came in at No. 30, and was the top employer in the Aleutians West census area. Icicle Seafoods ranked No. 32 and had the most workers in two regions – Dillingham and Petersburg, its home base. Westward Seafoods in Dutch Harbor came in at No. 37; Peter Pan ranked No. 40, with its largest operation at King Cove. Ocean Beauty was No. 45, and North Pacific Seafoods ranked No. 71. Both listed Kodiak as their Alaska headquarters.Coming in at No. 1 for the state’s largest private employer was Providence Health and Services with more than 4,000 workers. Wal-Mart, including Sam’s Club, ranked second, while Carrs/Safeway was third. Labor analysts pegged the number of private sector employees last year at 76,400 workers. The average annual wage of the top 100 employers was $54,377.Find more information regarding the terrific Alaska Economic Trends publication athttp://Labor.state.ak.us.<COL>Alaska’s 2009 salmon season seems a bust<COL>2009-08-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/11/fishing-jobs-increase-as-state-looks-at-boots-on-deck/<COL>Fishing jobs increase as State looks at ‘boots on deck’By Laine WelchMore Alaskans are taking to the fishing life, as indicated by upward ticks in harvesting jobs for three years running.That’s according to the November Alaska Economic Trends by the State Labor Department, which provides a look at the numbers of “boots on deck” by region and fishery. A first: economists Jack Cannon and Josh Warren also looked at how much time is put into fishing pre- and post-season prep work and clean-up, as well as what kinds of jobs fishermen have during the off times.Some highlights: On average, each month last year, 8,189 fishermen plied the waters of the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea; an increase of 122 jobs from the year before, and up 318 jobs since 2010.Of the 31,800 people who fished in Alaska last year, about 22,000 were crew members and 9,800 were permit-holders. The crew tends to be young, with an average age of 34; more than one-third were between 21 and 30. Permit-holders were considerably older, at age 47 on average.In terms of average monthly jobs, more than 56 percent were in salmon harvesting; groundfish and halibut fisheries followed at 15 and 12 percent, respectively.Statewide, 57 percent of harvesting jobs take place between June and August.By far, most of the harvesters were male at 86 percent; 85 percent of permit-holders were men, as were 88 percent of crew members.Averaged over the year, monthly fishing jobs were highest in Southeast Alaska (2,299); followed by the Aleutians (1,661); Southcentral (1,408); Bristol Bay (1,365); Kodiak (881) and the Yukon Delta at 372 jobs.A fishing job demands a lot of gear work and clean-up before and after each trip or season. In a survey, economists asked more than 9,000 permit-holders to specify the time their crew spent on this “work on the edges;” it generated an additional monthly average of 385 jobs.About a third of both halibut and salmon permit-holders worked other jobs last year. At the other end of the scale, 10 percent or less of groundfish and sablefish harvesters held a payroll job in 2012. That’s due — in part — to longer fishing seasons.In a final question, permit-holders were asked: “What factors could allow/cause you to increase the number of crew used to fish this permit?” A 60 percent survey return produced these top answers: Increase in catch: 71.3 percent; Increase in fish dock price: 41.2 percent; Advancing age: 38.4 percent.Fish watchCrabbers made quick work of their red king crab season at Bristol Bay, taking the roughly 8-million-pound quota in a month. The advance price of $6.35 per pound will add up to nearly $50 million at the docks. The Bering Sea Tanner crab fishery should wrap up by mid-December. Golden king crab fishing continues along the Aleutian Chain and winding down in Southeast. Likewise, the pot shrimp and sea cucumber fisheries are also tapering off. It’s still slow going for P- cod fishermen in the Gulf; they’ve taken only 2.4 million pounds of their 8.2-million-pound quota.Lots of fish meetings in the lineup:The industry will get a first peek at potential halibut catch numbers when the International Pacific Halibut Commission holds its interim meeting Dec. 4-5 in Seattle. Final decisions will be made Jan. 13-17 at the IPHC annual meeting, also in Seattle.The North Pacific Fishery Management Council meets Dec. 7-9 in Anchorage. Among other things, they will set catch quotas for next year’s groundfish catches in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.The State Board of Fisheries meets Dec. 5-6 in Anchorage to take up Chignik fisheries.

There’s a lot of fishermen in Alaska and I have no doubt there’s a lot of good ideas up there. “The ideas from Alaska include a halibut excluder device for trawl nets, and an escape panel for Tanner crab in the Gulf pot cod fishery. Past Smart Gear winners have used magnets to repel sharks from longline gear – one made changes to the chemical properties of fishing ropes and nets. The 2007 winner was a net called the “Eliminator” that uses fish behavior to reduce cod bycatch in haddock fisheries.Osmond said a Smart Gear entry this year from an East African engineering student really demonstrates the range of ideas — using sound to attract fish.“His work shows that fish generate different sounds when they are feeding, and at different ages and different species,”  Osmond explained. “He uses a  device inside a trap and when it’s full of fish, it also dials the fisherman’s cell phone.”A $30,000 cash prize goes to the winning Smart Gear entry; two runners up each get $10,000 and a $7,500 prize is awarded to a developing fisheries region.Along with the cash prizes, all winners receive help in testing and refining their gear.  The ultimate goal, Osmond says, is to get the smarter gear out on the water.The Smart Gear entries will be judged next month in Tanzania. Winners will be announced in September at the World Fishing Exhibition in Spain. (www.smartgear.org)Slammin’ salmon in the Bay – The world’s biggest sockeye salmon run at Bristol Bay is living up to its name. By last Friday the Bay-wide catch already topped the 24 million mark, the projected harvest, and there’s still plenty of fishing left to go.With all the salmon fisheries going on every summer across Alaska, you might wonder why so much attention is focused on Bristol Bay. The answer can be summed up in two words: sockeye salmon.Bristol Bay’s rivers are home to the largest red salmon runs in the world.  It is the source of Alaska’s most valuable salmon fishery – and nearly one third of the state’s total salmon fishing earnings come from Bristol Bay.  The Bay also has the most fishermen, with more than 2,800 salmon permit holders.  Last year the  Bristol Bay salmon fishery was valued at $113 million to fishermen —  sockeye salmon accounted for $111 million of that total.Whereas other fishing regions, such as Copper River, Southeast, Kodiak, Cook Inlet and the Alaska Peninsula,  enjoy sockeye salmon catches ranging from one million to four million, Bristol Bay’s harvests  can top 30 million fish.Here’s how it stacks up in terms of value, based on 2008 dock prices:   sockeyes were worth nearly $180 million – almost half the value of Alaska’s total salmon harvest.  Pink salmon ranked second, at a distant $86 million, followed by chums, valued at $79 million.Alaska’s salmon catch for this year is pegged at 175 million fish, a 20 percent increase from 2008.  If the forecast holds true, it will be the 11th largest harvest since statehood.  For those big money fish –  sockeyes – the projected catch is 38 million, down one million from last year.Death by sunscreen – All that sun block being slathered on by beach-goers around the world is causing major damage to ocean corals. A study funded by the European Commission revealed that the mix of 20 compounds used to protect skin from the harmful effects of the sun causes rapid bleaching of coral reefs.The World Trade Organization reports that 10 per cent of world tourism takes place in tropical areas, with nearly 80 million people visiting coral reefs each year. The WTO estimates that up to 6,000 tons of sun screen lotions are released into reef areas each year – and that up to 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs are at risk of ‘death by sunscreen.While Alaska’s deep sea corals face threats from ocean acidification, they are safe from sun screens. Unlike tropical varieties, Alaska corals don’t form reefs – they grow into dense gardens and can live for hundreds of years.  The waters surrounding the Aleutian Islands are believed to harbor the most abundant and diverse coldwater corals in the world.  Find the sunscreen and corals study in the U.S. Journal of Environmental Health Perspectives.<COL>‘Smart Gear’ reduces bycatch<COL>2009-07-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/12/will-alaskas-halibut-catches-be-cut-again-next-year/<COL>Will Alaska’s halibut catches be cut again next year?By Laine WelchThat’s the big question as the industry braces for the International Pacific Halibut Commission’s interim meeting this week in Seattle.By all accounts, there appear to be lots of halibut in Alaska waters, but their unusually slow growth rates have forced catches downward for nearly a decade. Alaska’s total catch this year was about 22 million pounds.Also up for review, 22 fishermen from remote communities in the mid-Aleutians (4A) are requesting an increase in their halibut catch to about half a million pounds. From the same region is a proposal to allow retention of halibut taken as bycatch in sablefish pot gear. Another proposal asks for mandatory length requirements for all halibut caught by sport charters.A report by the Halibut Bycatch Work Group, formed in 2011, that covers rates for every Alaska gear group and region is also up for discussion. The IPHC meets Dec. 4-5 in Seattle. For more information, check their website at: www.iphc.intStocks hold steadyThe 2014 catches for Alaska’s largest fisheries will also be decided in December. Summer trawl reports indicate the Bering Sea appears to be holding steady.“Based on the summer surveys, most of them were a slight uptick or a slight downtick,” said Jane DiCosimo, Senior Plan Coordinator with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council in Anchorage. “So we are not expecting major changes.”That’s likely to mean an Alaska pollock catch of nearly 3 billion pounds and a half-billion pounds of Pacific cod.Setting TACs, or Total Allowable Catches, requires going through a months-long process of federal advisory and public comment postings. For Alaska fish scientists, it means crunching biomasses, catches and dozens of data sets gathered into November. DiCosimo, who is a veteran of the mid-Atlantic council process, called the North Pacific’s ability to “crank out” sound quotas “unique in the nation.”“It’s complicated, but it’s designed to be able to use the summer survey information and the catch data practically up until the stock assessment is run. And that is unusual for the country,” she said. “I think we are in a unique and lucky situation where we have such (staff) resources devoted to being able to fish on the most current biomass data.”Also unique is the number of stock assessment surveys done in Alaska; Surveys looked at 23 separate species in both the Bering Sea/Aleutians and the Gulf.“We have an on-year, off-year cycle for the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands,” DiCosimo explained. “We have an annual cycle for trawl surveys for the eastern Bering Sea.”More than 80 percent of Alaska’s seafood landings come from federal waters (3-200 miles), and Alaska provides more than half of the nation’s wild-caught seafood. The NPFMC meets Dec. 9-17 at the Anchorage Hilton.Fish-savvy SenateAlaska’s two U.S. Senators make a great tag team when it comes to watching out for our fishing industry.Last week, the federal government officially declared in a letter to Senator Murkowski that, “America-managed fisheries do not require third-party certification to demonstrate responsible and sustainable practices.”That put to rest the blowback caused by the government’s practice of ignoring its own rules, and instead leaving it to private, Outside groups to decide if Alaska’s fisheries are well-managed.Murkowski introduced legislation in September, after learning that General Services (GSA) and the National Park Service required that all food concessions should, “Only offer fish/seafood identified as ‘Best Choices’ or ‘Good Alternatives’ on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch List or certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (or equivalent program).”That left out Alaska salmon, because the industry decided to opt out of high-priced, eco-label programs.The GSA has now changed its rules to say: “Where seafood options are offered, provide those procured from responsibly managed, sustainable healthy fisheries.”The revision puts Alaska salmon back on the “buy list” for the U.S. Park Service, the military and other federal food programs.Phony fish eggsSenators Begich and Murkowski have been relentless in their objections to federal approval of genetically modified Atlantic salmon dubbed “Frankenfish.” The fish are man-made by AquaBounty in the U.S. and Canada, and grow three times faster than normal salmon. The salmon would be the first genetically modified animal ever approved for human consumption.Last week, Begich blasted Canada’s approval of the sale of GM salmon eggs for grow out in Panama, where AquaBounty hopes to launch its Frankenfish production lines. The Canadian government acknowledged that the GM fish could present a high risk to Atlantic salmon in the event of an escape, and that there would be no immediate sale or consumption of GM salmon eggs in Canada.“If it’s not good for Canada, authorities there should not permit the production and distribution of this engineered life form elsewhere,” Begich said in a press release. “I will continue to object to the introduction and production of Frankenfish and will seek the closure of U.S. transportation routes to shipments of millions of eggs to Panama to prevent their accidental release due to handling mishaps or accidents.”Bay blooperThe 2014 forecast for Bristol Bay sockeye has been revised by state managers due to a database error. The new forecast calls for a harvest of 16.86 million fish in Bristol Bay and 1.06 million fish in the South Peninsula fisheries; approximately 620 thousand fish less than the initial release. The biggest cuts are in the Nushagak District.<COL>Will Alaska’s halibut catches be cut again next year?<COL>2013-12-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/12/pacific-halibut-catch-limits-down-for-next-year/<COL>Pacific halibut catch limits down for next yearBy Laine WelchIt comes as no surprise that recommendations for next year’s halibut catches are down again for all regions except Southeast Alaska.Fishery scientists with the International Pacific Halibut Commission have recommended a 2014 coast-wide commercial catch total of 24.45 million pounds; a 21 percent decrease from the 31 million pounds allowed for this year. That includes catches in Alaska, British Columbia and the Pacific Coast states.In a summation at a meeting in Seattle last week, the IPHC said: “The results of the 2013 stock assessment indicate that the Pacific halibut stock has been declining continuously over much of the last decade as a result of decreasing size-at-age, as well as recruitment strengths that are much smaller than those observed through the 1980s and 1990s.”The proposed catch limits for Alaska regions — in millions of pounds— compared to the totals from 2013 in parentheses:Southeast Alaska (2C) – 4.16, (2.97); Central Gulf (3A) – 9.43, (11.03); Western Gulf (3B) – 2.84, (4.29); Alaska Peninsula (4A) – 0.85, (1.33); Aleutian Islands region (4B) – 0.82, (1.45); Bering Sea (4CDE) 0.64, (1.94).Final decisions on catch limits, season start date and regulation changes will be made by the IPHC at its annual meeting, Jan. 13-17 in Seattle.While Pacific halibut catches have been declining for a decade, the value of the fishery has been on a downward trend for the past four years.Near the end of each year, bills are sent out to Alaska longliners who hold shares of the halibut and sablefish (black cod) catches. They are required to pay an annual fee to the federal government to cover the costs for managing and enforcing those fisheries. The fee, which is capped at three percent, is based on dock prices and averaged across the state.The billings were mailed out in late November to 2,024 fishermen; 90 fewer than last year, according to Troie Zuniga, fee coordinator for NOAA Fisheries in Juneau.This year, the combined halibut and sablefish fisheries paid a fee of 2.8 percent, which yielded $5 million for coverage costs.For halibut, the overall dockside value of the 2013 fishery was $105 million, and $72 million for black cod.“That’s about $32 million lower than the 2012 value for halibut and $37 million lower for black cod,” Zuniga said, adding that it reflects a fishery value decline of nearly 28 percent over four years.In terms of fish prices, the average for halibut this year was $5.06 per pound, compared to $5.87 last year. For sablefish, an average price of $2.84 per pound is a drop from $4.11 in 2013.The Bering Sea crab industry also pays a fee for its catch share programs, which yielded $3.5 million in coverage costs for the 2012-13 fishing year. Between 20-30 processors are responsible for collecting payments from crabbers and paying those bills in July, Zuniga said.NOAA doesn’t track crab prices, only the total dock value of the fisheries. The Bering Sea crab industry also took a big hit, coming in at $232 million; a $55 million drop from last year. Zuniga said the fee for the 2013-14 Bering Sea crab fishing year is 0.69 percent.Golden mysteriesGolden king crab from the far flung Aleutian Islands are one of Alaska’s biggest stocks – and one of its biggest mysteries.“They are such an interesting animal and they live in rocky, underwater mountain ranges where they hang on the cliffs,” said John Hilsinger, new science advisor for the Aleutian King Crab Research Foundation. “There is almost nothing known about the Aleutian Islands; it is probably one of the least-studied parts of Alaska,”The group was formed by crabbers last year to learn more about the remote fishery. Hilsinger, who replaces Denby Lloyd, said that’s what attracted him to the group.“It was the fact that the crab fishermen were interested in creating the nonprofit foundation and funding the research to work with the Department and National Marine Fisheries Service to try to get some information about these animals,” Hilsinger said in a phone interview from Anchorage. He said golden kings are “Alaska’s most unique crab fishery” because the fishing grounds extend for over 800 miles.During his nearly four decades with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Hilsinger was one of the first to push for research and fishing partnerships, starting with the Yukon River Drainage Association 25 years ago. He retired as director of commercial fisheries in 2010.As science advisor, he will work with the Aleutian crabbers to expand stock surveys they began last year. The rare surveys showed lots of large golden crabs are out there and lots of small recruits. Hilsinger said the golden crabs also are really tough and survive injuries that would kill other crab.“That is an interesting mystery,” he said. “Crab have an open circulatory system, meaning the blood is not contained in vessels and when you crack the shell, the blood leaks out. With golden king crab, when you crack that shell, the blood does not appear to leak out and they don’t bleed to death. I don’t think anyone knows why that is yet.”Another mystery: the Aleutian crabs seem unharmed by increasingly corrosive oceans. Hilsinger said that’s likely due to their extreme depths of up to 250 fathoms (1,500 feet, or five times deeper than red king crab).“That’s a real important characteristic for the future with expectations that ocean acidification will increase,” Hilsinger said. “That will be a potential threat to other crab species that are not so resilient.”The Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery runs from mid-August through mid-May, with a fixed quota of 6 million pounds.Fish correction: Fishermen from Western Alaska are requesting an increase in halibut catches for Area 4E (Bering Sea) and not Area 4A, as was incorrectly stated last week.<COL>Pacific halibut catch limits down for next year<COL>2013-12-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/12/famous-fish-retro-and-fish-picks-and-pans/<COL>Famous fish retro and fish picks and pans!by Laine WelchAlaska’s seafood industry worked hard again in 2013 to ramp up its message to policy makers, most of whom still tend to overlook the industry’s economic significance to the state and beyond. What is that message?That “the industry” is made up of thousands of small businesses – the fishing boats that each supports one or several families.That the seafood companies in coastal towns provide one of the state’s biggest tax bases. And together, fishing and processing provide more jobs in Alaska than oil/gas, mining, tourism and timber combined. Seafood also is Alaska’s top export, far exceeding all other natural resources.Here are fishing notables from 2013, in no particular order, followed by my annual ‘fish picks and pans’:Thousands of tiny red king crab raised at the Kodiak Fisheries Research Center were released into island waters, marking the first time hatchery-raised Alaska crab have been introduced into the wild. Divers will return to the stocking site to see how well they survive and thrive.Halibut fishermen were again put on notice to expect a 21% coast wide catch reduction for next year. That adds up to catches being slashed more than 70% over five years due primarily to slow growth rates. Also down by a dollar were dock prices as “halibut fatigue” finally hit the market over the skyrocketing costs and buyer scrambles for the dwindling fish. Meanwhile, the cost for halibut quota shares rose topped $50 per pound in prime areas.The EPA concluded that developing one of the largest mines on earth at the headwaters of Bristol Bay would indeed put the world’s biggest sockeye salmon resource at risk. The agency will decide in early 2014 whether to use its authority to stop the issuance of Pebble Mine permits under the Clean Water Act.Anglo-American pulled out of the Pebble Mine project, leaving Northern Dynasty of Canada as sole owner. Mine opponents said they will remain vigilant at the prospect of another investor signing onto the project.The first ever salmon dip net fishery on the Lower Yukon River was a resounding success for 90 fishermen. The nets were allowed as a way to fish for a good run of chums while protecting the Yukon’s dwindling numbers of king salmon.Harsh restrictions were imposed again on Kenai River sport and commercial fishermen due to continuing record low returns of king salmon.To find clues and solutions to the disappearing king salmon, Governor Parnell included $10 million in the budget as a first installment of a five year, $30 million research initiative focusing on 12 streams statewide.An oversupply of cod in world markets caused prices to drop to a point where many fishermen stayed tied to the docks (21-cents). Going into the new year, reports indicate big improvements with strong demand and higher prices. Cod accounts for 11% of Alaska’s total fish landings, most of which goes to China to be reprocessed.A superior court judge ruled that the state Department of Natural Resources violated its own rules by denying Alaskans’ their right to keep water in streams to protect wild salmon runs, in this case, at the location of the proposed Chuitna coal mine.Basketballs and mounds of buoys, Styrofoam and other marine debris continued to wash ashore in Alaska from the massive 2011 tsunami in Japan. The worst is reportedly yet to come, but it remains a head scratcher as to who picks up both the debris and the tab. At least 750,000 tons of debris is expected to hit Alaska’s coastline.Canada gave the go ahead for AquaBounty, the company producing a genetically modified salmon, for commercial production of GMO eggs at a Prince Edward Island hatchery. That marks the first time any government has given the go ahead to commercial scale production involving a GM food animal. That means Frankenfish is most likely poised to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, despite outpourings of opposition from constituents and a full on assault by Alaska’s Murkowski/Begich/Young. Next up: making sure the manmade salmon is labeled for consumers.Federal fishery managers began their move towards a “bycatch mitigation” plan for groundfish trawlers in the Gulf of Alaska, which will include some form of catch sharing. Fishing towns like Sand Point and Kodiak are making sure any new program protects their access to local resources and sustains, instead of drains, their communities.Alaska salmon got dumped on by Wal-Mart, the US Park Service, and Sodexo (global food contractor) for not using their choice of an eco-label that ensures the fishery is sustainably managed. The salmon industry opted out of labeling programs run by far away big wigs, believing the “Alaska” brand trumps a high priced eco-logo. Domino’s Pizza also took heat from Alaska for dissing halibut.Bristol Bay had a lackluster sockeye fishery after the bulk of the red run came and went eight days early. Quality improvements really started paying off with a base price of $1.50 a pound, an increase of 50 cents.Bristol Bay remained home to Alaska’s single most valuable salmon fishery, with Bay sockeyes totaling $138 million at the docks this summer.Brokers reported lots of great buzz for Bristol Bay driftnet salmon permits. Data show the value has increased steadily since 2010, most recently topping $135,000. (That compares to $20,000 in 2002.)Seas otters continued wreaking havoc for Southeast Alaska crabbers and divers.Most of the initial Dungeness fishermen have sold out and new entrants are buying dungy permits at basement prices.The Alaska Cam Sled began sending a live stream of non-invasive, high resolution images of the ocean bottom while being towed by a research vessel. The Cam Sled, built and based at Kodiak ADF&G, was dubbed “a really stupid robot that does one job really well.”Americans ate slightly less seafood last year at 14.6 pounds per person, compared to 15 pounds the year before. One bright note: Each person ate just over two pounds of salmon, a 3.5% increase.Alaska’s 2013 salmon catch was one for the record books at nearly 270 million fish, powered by a mindboggling pink haul of 216 million humpies. The previous catch record of 221 salmon was in 2005. The value of the 2013 catch ($691 at the docks) also is likely to set a record when all the numbers are officially tallied.For the second year running, Southeast claimed the title for the Alaska region with the highest salmon volumes and value. Fishermen there caught more than 100 million salmon for the first time ever, valued at nearly $220 million at the Panhandle docks.For the 16th year in a row, Dutch Harbor ranked as the nation’s top fishing port with 752 million pounds delivered, valued at $214 million.The Bristol B     hery was stalled by the government shutdown, when federal workers were furloughed and couldn’t compute how much crab each boat was allowed to catch.The chitin in shells of crabs, shrimp, lobsters and other crustaceans in Norway were being turned into bio-plastics for food packaging. Chitin, also found in insects and fungi, is one of the most abundant biodegradable materials in the world.Alaska’s coastal zone management program bit the dust when it failed to be extended by the legislature. That leaves Alaska as the only coastal state where citizens have no say on federal development decisions that could affect its 34,000 miles of coastline, more than all the other US states combined.2013 Fish Picks and PansBiggest fishing adjustment – The expanded observer program that includes onboard coverage for the first time of the ~1,500 halibut longline fleet.Best new fish dish – Alaskan Leader Seafoods cod dinners.

It’s 1,089. How about what percentage of Wrangellites fish for a living? Just over 15 percent. Or how many skippers plus crew fish out of Juneau? That number is 705.To help policymakers and the public become better informed about how the seafood industry fits into the state’s economy, the United Fishermen of Alaska have compiled Fishing Fact sheets for 26 communities, plus statewide tallies for Alaska and Washington.A big misconception the well-documented UFA data puts to rest is that money from fishing only benefits the coastal communities where the fish cross the docks. In fact, seafood landing and business taxes are split 50/50 between the port where the fish is delivered and state coffers — to be distributed at the whim of the Alaska Legislature.At a glance, fishing facts show that Kodiak (home to 690 fishing boats) received more than $1.6 million in fisheries taxes in FY 2012; the State received the same. The Kenai Peninsula Borough (which  claims more than 1,000 fishing boats) added another $1.8 million. Sitka, Cordova and Petersburg each contributed more than $1 million in fish taxes to the state general fund.The Aleutians East Borough, which includes Akutan, Cold Bay, False Pass, King Cove, Nelson Lagoon and Sand Point added another $4 million, while Unalaska/ Dutch Harbor topped them all, putting more than $8.5 million in fisheries taxes. Overall, the seafood industry put in $90 million to state coffers through FY 2012.UFA’ s fishing fact sheets also include data on how many people catch and process fish in each community, as well as earnings, vessels and permits owned by region, support industries and much more.They include Aleutians East Borough, Aleutians West Census Area, Anchorage, Bethel Census Area, Bristol Bay Borough, Cordova, Dillingham Census Area, Haines Borough, Homer, Juneau, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Kenai, Ketchikan, Kodiak, Lake and Peninsula Borough, Matanuska–Susitna Borough, Petersburg, Prince of Wales–Outer Ketchikan Census Area, Seward, Sitka, Skagway–Angoon–Hoonah Census Area, Unalaska–Dutch Harbor, Valdez, Wrangell, Yakutat and the Yukon Koyukuk Census Area. http://www.ufa-fish.org/cff.htmA pollock pat on the backSpeaking of contributions, the Pollock Conservation Cooperative was recognized this month for its annual contributions to the University of Alaska/Fairbanks, which total more than $13 million since 2000. It is the largest donation in the University’s history. The PCC includes the member companies of the At-Sea Processors Association, whose boats fish with mid-water gear in the Bering Sea.The group formed a catch-share cooperative in 1998, and shortly after, partnered with the university to develop a marine research grants program, and to support a faculty position within the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Each year, APA members contribute $1 million to help sustain and expand the programs.“The APA/PCC companies appreciate UAF’s recognition of our continued contributions to improving knowledge of the ocean environment. This is a successful collaboration of industry and educators working together to anticipate and meet the needs of the present and the future,” said Stephanie Madsen of Juneau, PCC Executive Director.Fish feedersSeaShare, which got its start in the mid 1990s in Alaska as a “bycatch to food banks” program, has become one of the largest protein donors in Alaska and the nation.The group has gotten the backing of federal fish managers to amend permits three times in the last two years to allow more boats and processors to participate. That has allowed SeaShare to expand its donations to food banks in Fairbanks, Kotzebue, Dutch Harbor, Juneau and Galena. All is at no cost to the recipients.Some recent highlights: The USCG flew six pallets of halibut from Kodiak to Kotzebue. Lynden shipped a full truckload of frozen salmon steaks from Seattle to Fairbanks. Some 13,000 pounds of salmon portions were delivered to the Bellingham Food Bank; approximately 6,000 pounds of breaded portion were donated to the Millionaire Club and the Union Gospel Mission in Seattle. Another 43,000 pounds of breaded pollock portions were donated to the Oregon Food Bank, and 1,100 pounds of canned salmon were donated to Helpline House on Bainbridge Island, Wash.SeaShare also recently received 400,000 pounds of donated salmon and pollock“That’s great news for the hungry families we serve,” said director Jim Harmon. “But before we can ship them out, the salmon has to be steaked and re-packed, and the pollock blocks require re-processing into, breaded portions. Generous companies have offered discounted processing, but even with their help, SeaShare will still incur approximately 42 cents per pound to ‘finish’ these donations.”Celebrate Seven Fishes!The Feast of the Seven Fishes is an Italian-American Christmas Eve celebration that typically consists of seven different seafood dishes; (although some families celebrate with up to 13 different dishes.)This celebration commemorates the wait for the midnight birth of the baby Jesus on Christmas Day. The long tradition dates from the Roman Catholic practice of abstinence — in this case, refraining from the consumption of meat on the eve of certain holy days. Observant Catholics would instead eat fish, typically fried in oil.There are many hypotheses for what the number seven represents. Most believe it stems from the Bible, in which seven is the most repeated number and appears more than 700 times.Regardless of your reason for the season, celebrate Alaska’s seafood at Christmas and all year!<COL>United Fishermen deliver cold, hard facts about Alaska fishing<COL>2013-12-23<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/03/halibut-opener-could-bring-high-prices-during-storm/<COL>Halibut opener could bring high prices during stormby Laine WelchBlustery winds and high seas put a damper on Alaska’s March 6 halibut opener, with prices expected to be artificially high for skimpy landings of the season’s first fresh fish.“That’s the question of the day,” said one Kodiak halibut buyer.“It’s hard to say how it will shake out,” agreed Matt Moir, manager at Alaska Pacific Seafoods, one of Kodiak’s largest processing plants. “The weather forecast is not good and frozen inventory is low, but the market won’t sustain goofy prices. If it gets too high, the market will shut down.”Talk on the waterfront pegged starting prices in Homer around $5 a pound, but no word from elsewhere until deliveries start hitting the docks. Last year’s starting prices were in the $3-$3.50 range, down more than a dollar from the previous two years.Halibut prices usually drop after the first month, when the market starts to settle out. Marketers expect about 4.5 million pounds of halibut will move to restaurants and supermarkets in the first month of fishing this year. Overall, there will be less of the big flatfish to go around during the eight month season — the coast-wide catch of 50.6 million pounds is a 6.4 percent decrease from last year. That includes fisheries in British Columbia, the West Coast and Alaska.Alaska provides 80 percent of the North Pacific halibut harvest, and this year’s catch limit is 42.3 million pounds. That’s a drop of 3.3 million pounds from 2009. More than 2,100 Alaska longliners hold catch shares of halibut.Homer holds the title of the nation’s No. 1 port for halibut deliveries, followed by Kodiak, Seward and major ports in Southeast. Dutch Harbor also ranks as one of Alaska’s biggest ports for halibut landings. In fact, the largest halibut ever caught at 459 pounds was taken from Unalaska Bay. The sablefish (black cod) fishery also opens at the same time as halibut. Both fisheries end in mid-November.As a point of reference: the average price paid to Alaska halibut fishermen in 2009 was $3.13 per pound, down from $3.70 in 2008. The dockside value of the halibut fishery was $132 million, a drop of $43 million from 2008. For sablefish, the average price in 2009 was $3.21 per pound, compared to $2.58 in 2008. The value at the docks was $77 million, an increase of $8 million from 2008.Salmon slideFishermen are some of the best innovators. That was demonstrated most recently in the Salmon Slide; a device designed for salmon gillnets that prevents the fish from being dropped on the hard deck. As the fish are picked from the net, the rubberized canvas Slide intercepts them, zips them into a cylinder mounted directly below and aft of the drum. It then directs the salmon toward port or starboard fish holds.?            “When I first put it on the boat, I could see the crew rolling their eyes and thinking this is just another one of my crazy things that will just be in the way and won’t work,” said Dave Hansen, a 30-year fishing veteran at Bristol Bay. “But from day one, everyone went, ‘Whoa, this really works.’”Hansen invented the Salmon Slide after years of experimentation to find ways to improve fish quality. Originally, he just wanted to see if it would work for use on his own boat, the Eskimo Viking. It worked so well, Trident Seafoods put up funding to develop more.“I brought the initial demo to Trident and they could see that it was adaptable and could work,” Hansen said. “They placed a large order and since then, a few other processing companies have also. Now it’s taking off.”The Salmon Slide also made a big impression on Southeast gillnetters who focus on volumes of chum salmon, Hansen said. He believes it will work well on most fishing boats, and along with boosting fish quality, it also gives the crew a break.“It’s much easier on the crew’s hands. When six heavy fish come over the roller, that’s basically 30 pounds on your fingertips that you’re  hanging onto as you’re trying to pick one fish,” he explained. “Now they are supported and additionally, the firm canvas is right above the knee and they can lean into it. The Slide really helps keep your balance and makes it a lot easier to stand up on deck.”Cost for the Salmon Slide is about $1,200. Hansen said sales are now being made to processors who turn them over to their fishing fleets.

Japan remains the state’s largest seafood export market, followed by China, Korea, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.Next in line: zinc and lead exports, valued at $784.7 million; liquefied natural gas at $256.7 million (most has been shipped to Japan for more than 40 years); precious metals, mostly gold, at $152.6 million (nearly all went to Switzerland); refined petroleum products at $38.4 million (down more than 70 percent). Coal exports were valued at $33 million (up 42.8 percent). Most of Alaska’s energy exports go to Pacific Rim countries.Overall, Alaska’s 2009 exports were 8.1 percent lower than in 2008.<COL>Halibut opener could bring high prices during storm<COL>2010-03-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/01/walmart-reps-schooled-on-alaskas-salmon-industry/<COL>Walmart reps ‘schooled’ on Alaska’s salmon industryby Laine WelchWalmart reps were in Juneau last week to learn more about Alaska’s salmon fisheries, and to make sure management is up-to-snuff with the company’s sustainability criteria.Alaska’s salmon industry opted out of the high-priced certification program that Walmart uses as its seafood purchasing standard (London-based Marine Stewardship Council). Alaska instead adopted the UN-sanctioned Responsible Fisheries Management program for “well-managed” certification; a label that has become practically a requirement in most seafood buying and selling today.That put Walmart in the problematic position of finding Alaska salmon outside the bounds of the company’s seafood sourcing guidelines. When word spread last summer that Walmart might not stock it on its shelves, Alaskans went ballistic. Thus, the trip to Juneau.Seven Walmart officials met for several days with Governor Sean Parnell, state officials and seafood industry experts and scientists. The mood was friendly, said John Renner, vice-president of Cordova District Fishermen United, who spent time with the group.“All parties want to get something done. And Walmart wants to get itself out of the box it got itself into,” Renner said. “They were eager to learn and impressed by what they saw. I really got the impression that they came away with a better understanding of Alaska’s management and the fisheries themselves.”Renner said he came away with “a positive feeling that something will happen shortly after a couple of tweaks are made to the written criteria and allow others besides the MSC.”Gov. Parnell said he welcomed the company’s pledge to work toward a policy that supports Alaska’s commitment to sustainability, rather than a particular brand of seafood certification.David Baskin, Walmart’s vice president of meat and seafood, said the company “remains committed to buying Alaska seafood, and we’re excited that the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute has agreed to work with us to ensure the RFM standard meets the principles for credible sustainable fisheries programs as developed by The Sustainability Consortium. The Consortium is expected to release its principles in the coming days.”Renner said that, along with the lessons in good management, the Walmart group also took home the message that they are dealing with thousands of independent small fishing businesses.“Everyone in Alaska rallied as one,” he said. “This was the first time in these kinds of battles we’ve seen such a coming together of processors, fishermen and the State. And Congress got behind what they saw as a major threat to our salmon market and took steps to alleviate it.”Fish angstAny child’s chemistry set will show that our oceans are becoming more corrosive. It stems primarily from the ocean absorbing larger amounts of carbon dioxide caused by the global burning of fossil fuels for energy — especially coal. The increasing acidity prevents shells and skeletons from growing on marine creatures. Now scientists have found that ocean acidification also changes fish behavior.Normal fish are used to moving between the shaded and light parts of a kelp forest, for example, looking for food or interacting with other fish. Studies by Martin Tresguerres, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in California, show that OA affects fish neurons in a way that makes them feel more threatened, and they prefer to stay more sheltered.Tresguerres’ team studied the brains of juvenile rockfish living in acidic waters. Rockfish have predictable behaviors, he said, so it’s easier to detect changes. When placed in a tank with one dark and one white wall, a rockfish exposed to the corrosive waters stayed close to the dark wall, as did a fish that had been given an anxiety-inducing drug. That might not sound like a big deal, but it is.“Depending on the species, if they normally go offshore at a certain period of time, or they might go to a certain area to spawn and reproduce, it might affect the way they interact with other fish. So the potential implications are pretty big,”? Tresguerres told KUCB/Unalaska.The behavior changes could eventually shift the entire ecosystem, said study co-author Trevor Hamilton.“What could end up happening is the fish will spend less time leaving their safe environments,” Hamilton said. “So there is potential for them to get caught by fewer nets and get eaten by fewer predators. It could have an effect all the way up the food chain, as well as for general fishing for humans.”On a related note: An Australian study showed that increased acidity affected the sense of smell in clownfish.Here comes halibutHalibut catch limits, season start/end dates, bycatch issues and perhaps some new fishing regulations will be decided at the 90th-annual meeting of the International Pacific Halibut Commission this week in Seattle.At the table will be the three new appointees made last week by President Obama after a two-year search. They are Dr. Jim Balsiger, director of NOAA Fisheries in Juneau (reappointed); Don Lane, a commercial fisherman and retired Coast Guardsman from Homer; and Bob Alverson of the Fishing Vessel Owners Association of Seattle.This column sponsored byRedden Marine Supply235-8612Open 7 Days a Week3.5 Mile East End Road, Homer, AK 99603<COL>Walmart reps ‘schooled’ on Alaska’s salmon industry<COL>2014-01-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/03/low-interest-federal-loans-available/<COL>Low-interest federal loans availableBy Laine WelchAlaska’s halibut and sablefish fisheries include a built-in, low-interest federal loan opportunity to help new entrants buy shares of the fish.  The loans are funded by a fee of up to 3 percent of the dockside value of the catch. Seventy-five percent of the total goes to recover management and enforcement costs; 25 percent supports the loan program. Fishermen are eligible for 80 percent of the purchase price of quota shares, paid back for up to 25 years at a low interest rate; currently 6.5 percent.The catch share plan for Bering Sea crab was designed the same way.  But five years later, loans to buy crab poundage aren’t even on the books.What’s the hold up? Being near the bottom of the bureaucratic in-box in distant Washington, D.C.“The rule-making, unfortunately, has taken considerably longer than we had initially thought,” said Leo Erwin, Chief of Financial Services at NOAA Fisheries headquarters. “We had the proposed rule, it’s been drafted, and it has been in the clearance process for some time. We believe we are pretty close to getting the rule actually published.”Senator Lisa Murkowski is credited with obtaining $16 million for Alaska’s combined catch share loan programs, and the loan authority for crab is there. But before any cash can be cut loose, it has to go through the long federal lawmaking process before it is official.“They will have to come out with a proposed rule, take comments from the public, go through the rule making, take more comments,” said fisheries aide Arne Fuglvog. “I mean, the money is there to do it and we would really like to see these loans coming out this year.”Jim Stone, a lifelong Bering Sea crabber, said he is frustrated by the federal foot-dragging, adding that it has prevented crew from buying crab poundage.“I find it especially disappointing when the existing crew loan program for halibut and sablefish has near a zero default rate,” Stone asked. “So why would a program with such a good track record of paying the government back not move forward as quickly as possible? We should have had this in place five years ago.”Stone worked his way from deckhand to owner of the F/V Arctic Hunter. He said it is easier now to buy into the crab fishery.“Back when I did it, you had to make a huge loan and buy a 100-foot boat and make an extremely big investment. Then you’d roll the dice and go out there with no guarantee you’d catch anything to pay for the fuel and the crew and your big bank loan,” Stone explained. “Now you can buy a little bit of quota and start buying in for as little as $1,000. You don’t have to start out buying a big chunk.”Stone said he and other Bering Sea crab boat owners plan to offer their own loan program to their crews to get the ball rolling.“We would ask them to pay 50 percent on a small amount and the other 50 percent we would loan over a 7-10-year period,” he said. “The idea is that they would lease it onboard our own boat.”So when might the federal crab loan program be in place?“Perhaps the earliest we would have a final rule in place — assuming we get this proposed rule published relatively soon — which we think will happen. Then we have the comment period, and then we respond to the comments in the final rule … and then that becomes effective,” said Leo Erwin. “But I think that process, at the earliest, would look like just before the end of the fiscal year, or perhaps go past the fiscal year, which for the government concludes Sept. 30.”Halibut blowsFor the second year in a row, icy winds and blizzards bit into the start of Alaska’s halibut season.One week into the fishery, only 46 landings totaling 345,728 pounds had crossed the docks in Alaska. Homer scored the first landing – 42,500 pounds that fetched $5.95-$6.25 per pound at the online Auction Block.“It’s the highest I ever heard of, a new record,” said auction owner Kevin Hogan. “It’s supply and demand!”It’s not unusual for early fish prices to top $5 per pound, although last year’s prices dropped to $3.50 per pound. Hogan said halibut supplies are likely to remain tight for a week or two.“There hasn’t been anything coming in from Canada or Southeast,” he added. “There is very little fish available and not much on the horizon.”What is on the horizon? More blizzards and frigid temperatures throughout the Gulf this week.Alaska supplies 80 percent of North America’s halibut — more than 42 million pounds this year. But even after the weather lays down, fishermen won’t be in a big hurry to flood the market.To help maintain a stable price, Alaska longliners have learned to tickle the market, seldom delivering more than two million pounds each week throughout the eight month fishery.Fish bitsArni Thomson was elected president of United Fishermen of Alaska, the nation’s largest commercial fishing advocacy group. Thomson is 20-year director of Seattle-based Alaska Crab Coalition, and uber-fish policy wonk at state and national levels. Thomson said he is relocating to Anchorage and looks forward to getting up to speed on Alaska salmon fisheries.

The show is the largest in North America, attracting some 16,000 buyers and sellers from 90 countries.“People are much more optimistic this year,” said John Sackton, a veteran industry market expert.Sackton said demand for seafood is increasing and people are scrambling to get certain types of fish.“Pollock, salmon and crab —  all of these markets are quite strong right now and it made for a good show,” he explained.According to Sackton, a hot-button topic at the Boston show was “short weights.”“A lot of legitimate seafood sellers are competing with unscrupulous importers who bring in product at 70-80 percent net weight because of over-glazing,” he explained. “Then they sell it to restaurants at a lower price. It’s very difficult for a lot of the established companies and brands to compete with this. There is a lot of feeling that the FDA really needs to step up enforcement in this area.”Sackton added that companies that short weight also take short cuts with food safety.One of the best things gained from the Boston show each year is learning about the buying and eating trends of American consumers. Major food gurus all said that Americans are eating more seafood to improve their health. National surveys by The Perishables Group showed that 82 percent of consumers said they bought more seafood in 2009 because they are trying to eat healthier. And Omega 3 is the hottest label claim in the market today.Belt-tightening during the recession has changed shopping patterns —  fewer Americans are eating seafood at restaurants and more are buying it to eat at home. Shoppers are looking for good values though, and discount coupons are back in vogue.One troubling sign: there is a huge age gap among U.S. seafood eaters.  According to the Power of Meat study by the Food Marketing Institute and American Meat Institute, 40 percent of shoppers aged 65 or older say they want to eat more seafood. However, only 16 percent of 18 to 24 year olds.Seafood Source News said eating trends from the show: more use of raw fish in sushi and ceviche, whole fish dishes, all-in-one steam pots and fish tacos — with Taco Bell announcing a new fish taco addition to its menu. A new product getting good buzz: Trident’s Wasabi Sticks: a surimi crab leg with wasabi in the center.Jonathan Forsling of Togiak Seafoods made his first trip to the Boston show, and said he was surprised by all the farmed fish.“I didn’t expect to see so much of that. It was a bit of a shock,” he told KDLG.Martha Fox agreed it was an eye-opener.“I’ve realized that — for fishermen who live in my area — it is important to  keep the quality of fish high if we want better fish and more markets,” she said.Lawmakers LOSTU.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they have the votes to finally ratify the Law of the Sea treaty. The 1982 UN treaty – which includes 158 nations — governs activities on, over and beneath the oceans. It includes the Arctic,  but the United States can’t stake any claims to that region until it signs onto the treaty.“We have an opportunity as an Arctic nation to extend our territory based on the outer continental shelf, and annex an area close to the size of California that would be available to us for resource exploration and development,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski in a phone interview. “Not only can we not submit a claim or application, we cannot dispute anybody else’s.”Treaty-signing might not happen any time soon. That’s not because of political bickering, but due to Congress being so tied up by the healthcare debate and the upcoming mid-term elections. Murkowski said congressional calendars are jammed.Meanwhile, Russia already has planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole and is building the first offshore oil rig that can withstand extreme cold and pack ice. Norway is staking claims to vast oil and gas deposits. And Canada has announced plans for an Arctic military training base.“So we have all these other Arctic nations that are able to tap into a resource that we too would have been able to claim for our own,” Murkowski fumed. “But we can’t act unless we are a signatory to that treaty. To me, it’s a no-brainer.”Fish bitsAt press time, the Sitka Sound roe herring fishery was ready to pop.

The ban includes the Anchorage area, much of the Kenai Peninsula, Valdez and Juneau. It would completely eliminate Cook Inlet set-netters and affect roughly 500. Lt. Governor Mead Treadwell decided two weeks ago to not allow the question to go before Alaska voters as a ballot initiative in 2016. The newly formed Kenai-based Alaska Fisheries Conservation Alliance followed up with an appeal filed in Alaska Superior Court.“In a measure based on conservation and Alaska law, our organization will challenge the decision to disallow our proposed statewide commercial set-net ban in the urban, non-subsistence regions of Alaska from going to the state voters,” AFCA Director Clark Penney said at a press conference.Alliance legal counsel Matt Singer called the legal opinion “incorrect.”“The decision by the Lt. Governor and the opinion by the Attorney General upon which it was based is wrong,” Singer said. “The decision, should it stand, will set a dangerous precedent for Alaska.”The set-net ban is being driven primarily by the dwindling number of king salmon returning to Cook Inlet, which has curtailed fishing across the board for several years. Removing set-netters would likely shift more fish to sport anglers and the salmon fleet targeting sockeyes.Treadwell ruled that it amounts to fish allocation decisions, which cannot be made through a voter initiative. The Alliance insists it is a conservation measure. Treadwell urged all users to find solutions, and let decisions be made by the State Board of Fish. Matt Singer countered that AFCA has no confidence in the Board.“The Board has not conserved kings, and the voters have a right to express their will,” he asserted.Cook Inlet sport fishermen would not oppose restrictions in the name of king conservation, said AFCA President Joe Connors.“Please keep in mind, concerning Kenai River guides, that they are at the lowest number in 20 years,” Connors said. “Last year, there were 284 from a high of 420 guides 15 years ago.”Alliance founder and sport fish icon Bob Penney said he recognizes the importance of commercial fishing in Alaska, but alleged that set-nets have the “highest bycatch” of any fishing in state waters. Penney called set-nets an “inappropriate gear” when king salmon numbers were steadily dwindling.“You don’t wait ‘til the kings are gone to say we should have done something,” Penney said. “Now is the time to protect the fish. Conservation of the fish comes first.”The set-net ban is widely opposed by other Alaska fishing groups, and the City and Borough of Kenai. The Alliance hopes to fast track the set-net ban case, Singer said, so a decision is made in the next few months.Pebble point/counterpointReactions last week by Alaska’s U.S. Senators differed widely to the Environmental Protection Agency’s conclusion that the Pebble Mine would be “devastating” to the Bristol Bay salmon fishery and Native culture.That sets the stage for the agency to use its authority under the Clean Water Act to permanently ban mining in the region.Senator Lisa Murkowski was critical of what she terms a “preemptive” veto.“I had expressed concern about an effort to prejudge where there has not been a plan that is clearly delineated, permit applications have not been made and the required analysis completed,” she said in a phone conversation. “The project is not located on federal lands, it’s on state lands, and you have a federal agency weighing in ahead of such time as there has been a clear project outlined.”The EPA weighed in at the request of more than a dozen Alaska Native tribes in the Southwest region.Senator Mark Begich had a different stance, calling Pebble “the wrong mine in the wrong place.”The “science” drove his decision, Begich said, and a visit to Red Dog — an open put zinc mine near Kotzebue that he supports — reinforced it.“In my view, that specific type of mine could devastate the long-term subsistence, commercial and recreational fisheries, and I felt it was not worth trading off a nonrenewable resource for a renewable resource,” Begich said.Fish watchAlaska’s share of this year’s halibut catch will be just less than 20 million pounds; down about 11 percent from 2013. Southeast Alaska was the only region where the catch limit increased, topping 4 million pounds. The halibut fishery will run from March 8 to Nov. 7Alaska’s pollock fisheries began on Jan. 20 in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. The Bering Sea catch will be nearly 3 billion pounds this year; another 4-million pounds will come from the Gulf, up nearly 45 percent from last year. Trawlers also are targeting cod and various flat fish in both regions.The Bering Sea snow crab catch has topped 30 percent of the 48.5 million pound harvest limit. Crabbers also are targeting Tanner crab and golden kings along the Aleutians.Fish bucks give backAmerican Seafoods Company is again calling for applications for its community grants program.

Last year, Chilean salmon production dropped 60 percent and exports are predicted to be down 40 percent in 2010. Salmon farms in Chile have been cut nearly in half, from 344 in 2007 to 174 farms last year, reported Seafood Source News.“It has helped to keep the salmon market somewhat stronger than it might have been if the Chileans had been producing as much as people expected them to,” said Gunnar Knapp, a fisheries economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage.Chilean fish farmers also have been widely criticized for using “hair-raising” amounts of antibiotics to curtail disease outbreaks. Last year, federal seafood inspectors discovered three chemicals in Chilean farmed salmon that are banned in the United States, including a pesticide that kills sea lice.Nation’s fish basket safe … for nowFishing cheers went up when President Obama withdrew offshore oil and gas leases for Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering Sea, an area encompassing 5.6 million acres of America’s most important fishing grounds.The decision cancels planned 2011 and 2014 lease sales in the nation’s fish basket — waters that supply more than 40 percent of the U.S. seafood harvest, valued at more than $2 billion dollars annually.Leases for the region were pulled by President Clinton after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but reinstated in 2007 by President Bush in his final days in office. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar visited the Bristol Bay region last year, and called it a “national treasure.”Dan Strickland of the Alaska Marine Conservation Council said it was gratifying that he heard the people’s voices.“Sixty-six native groups, fishing organizations, local tribal governments all lined up in support of protections for the Bay and Bering Sea. President Obama and Sec. Salazar acknowledged it is a very special place, and especially valuable for the jobs  and the revenue it provides through fisheries,” Strickland said from Homer. “I would hope that same sort of analysis would take place when the state and federal government look to further development in the area.”Strickland cautions, however, that the reprieve is not a done deal.“It’s not permanent,” he explained. “It provides protection for Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering Sea until 2017.”“The focus now will be to get permanent protection because, as we have seen, this could just as easily be withdrawn by another president,” Strickland said. “We are going to work toward perhaps legislative action so we don’t have to fight this again and again.”Seismic testing and fishFrom the Norway Post: “Sound waves from seismic data acquisition resulted in increased catches for some species and smaller catches for others. It appears that pollack may, to some extent, have withdrawn from the area, while other species seem to remain.These are the main results from the research commissioned by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and carried out by the Institute of Marine Research during the summer of 2009 on the effects of seismic surveys off Vesterålen. This consequential research project is one of the largest ever conducted. The survey clearly indicates that the fish reacted to the sound from the seismic guns.The most probable explanation for both the increased and reduced catches for the various species and fishing gear is that the sound waves from the seismic guns put the fish under some stress, causing more swimming activity.The NPD both initiated and funded this research project, which had a cost ceiling of NOK 25 million.” ($4.1 million U.S.)Boom Boom 101Seismic testing evolved from the discovery that when earthquakes occur, it is possible to capture the sound waves created and use the data to map geophysical features that lie underground. Much of what we know about the Earth’s core, mantle, and crust is the result of this discovery, and it follows that man-made or sound waves can also be used to map subsurface formations that indicate stores of fossil fuels.When oil and gas companies explore and measure the ocean for oil and gas, large ships fire high-intensity and low frequency sounds are emitted into the marine environment. During seismic surveys, an array of  between 15 and 45 air guns fires shots every 10 to 25 seconds, 24-hours-a-day. The blasts can reach volumes of 260 decibels (anything above 180 decibels is believed to be harmful to marine mammals). Seismic testing occurs throughout the entire lifetime the offshore oil and gas industry operates in an ocean area.Salmon spawns skin creamA chance discovery by farmed salmon hatchery workers has spawned a line of skin care products that help cure disorders and also keeps skin younger looking. According to Intrafish, scientists in Norway became curious after it was noticed that hatchery workers who spent long hours handling salmon fry in cold seawater had softer, smoother hands. Normally, hands held in cold water become red, dry and cracked.Researchers at Norway’s University of Science and Technology discovered the skin softening component came from the enzyme zonase, found in the hatching fluid of the salmon eggs. The enzyme’s task is to digest the protein structure of the tough egg shells without harming the tiny fish. The scientists hailed this dual ability as the secret behind the beneficial properties for human skin.Zonase helps dead skin flake off and stimulates the growth of healthy, new skin cells. It also has proved helpful in healing wounds. The new product underwent clinical trials at a hospital in Sweden and is now patented.<COL>Chilean woes boost Alaska’s salmon sales<COL>2010-04-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/03/20000-deckhands-prove-difficult-to-track-for-ufa/<COL>20,000 deckhands prove difficult to track for UFABy Laine WelchIt’s tough to track a workforce when you don’t know where it is. But that will remain the case for more than 20,000 Alaska deckhands — at least for the immediate future.Crews aboard fishing boats are one of the only groups of laborers in Alaska not counted by the state. A project to collect labor data on deckhands in every fishery has been under development for two years, and it seemed to be on its way for legislative approval this year.Concerns by the United Fishermen of Alaska, however, were enough to stall the program from being introduced this session. At issue: skippers would be tasked with all the paperwork.“We support the project, but feel the burden should be on the crew,” said UFA executive director Mark Vinsel. “Skippers can verify the information. But this shouldn’t be a big hurdle to the program.”Member salmon fishermen who make multiple deliveries a day were very concerned about the data collection and reporting, said UFA president-elect Arni Thomson.“Some setnetters work four or five sites,” she explained. “They’d likely have to hire a bookkeeper to keep track of all the data.”From the outset, multi-agency and industry stakeholder advisory teams expected that deckhands could provide their own work data using existing fish tickets and electronic landing systems.“Crews are so transitory, and modifying the simple swipe card system already in place is the best idea,” said Shawn Dochtermann of the Kodiak-based Crewmen’s Association and a stakeholder committee member. “We were really surprised to see that option not included in the final analysis. We all are willing to be very flexible, but without a crew swipe card, the program is being set up to fail.”The crew doing their own reporting was in the lineup originally, but longer analyses showed it was not feasible for collecting the kinds and quality of data needed, said Jan Conitz, project director for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.“The real problem is that we don’t actually know who is fishing as crew members.” Conitz said. “We have a database showing persons who purchased licenses, but we don’t know where they fished or how long — or if they even fished at all. Others use a limited-entry permit to qualify for crew license. So we don’t even know who those people are.”And since we don’t collect any other crew data, there is nothing we can use to check the accuracy of their reports. In the case of skippers, we have their landing reports and a record of their activities, so it is easier to follow up if we have missing or inaccurate data.”Meanwhile, all agree that giving the program a trial run is a worthwhile idea. Conitz is working with fishermen in Kodiak fleet to have both crew and skippers voluntarily collect and report work data in log books for an upcoming cod fishery. She is hopeful it will show the task is not a big deal.“The actual reporting is not a big effort by anyone, but it’s been blown up to be bigger than it is,” Conitz said. “It comes on the back of all kinds of other regulations and reporting requirements that people don’t like, so it might just be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”Dochtermann said fishing interests are “getting our ducks in a row for next year,” and Conitz remains convinced that Alaska deckhands will soon be counted and credited for their work.“It’s ridiculous that in this day and age we can’t characterize this workforce completely; that we have this data gap,” she said.Conitz added that the biggest beneficiary of the labor data will be coastal communities.“If we can demonstrate the entire economic impact of the workforce — where they live and to some extent what they earn and what they are spending, that bolsters the industry as a whole,” Conitz said. “It’s not just about the deckhands.”Processors can take itBristol Bay processors again say they can handle this summer’s run at the world’s biggest sockeye salmon fishery. That’s according to the annual processor survey by ADF&G which aims to give a snapshot of anticipated processing capacity for the Bay.The 2010 forecast calls for a catch of 30.5 million sockeye salmon — down just slightly from last year. Thirteen companies said they will be buying and processing fish at Bristol Bay this summer, and they can handle 1.8 million salmon per day. That’s identical to last year.  Processors expect a 6-percent decrease in tendering capacity throughout Bristol Bay this summer, but an increase in air transport.Fishermen are skeptical, though, about the processors’ claims they can handle all the salmon. For the past two summers, huge pulses of salmon plugged processing plants for several days, and fishermen were put on limits or beached at the peak of the season. A study by the Juneau-based McDowell Group found that 37 million fish worth $131 million to Bristol Bay fishermen swam by their nets from 2003 to 2008.The Bristol Bay salmon fishery accounts for 26 percent of all seafood harvesting jobs in Alaska, and 33 percent of all wages paid in the Bristol Bay region.AK’s biggest crops dropDon’t ever refer to it as farming — call it “ocean farming” instead.  Home-grown fish are now Alaska’s largest agricultural crop.Whereas farmed fish are grown in closed pens or cages until they’re ready for market, Alaska fish — mostly salmon — are started in hatcheries and released as fingerlings to the sea. When the fish return home, they make up a huge part of Alaska’s total salmon catch.The State oversees 36 hatcheries in Alaska, mostly privately run nonprofits, with a few owned by the state or the feds. The hatcheries raise a mix of five salmon species for commercial and sport catches.Fish crops took a nosedive last year. The state’s 2009 salmon enhancement report shows that 45 million fish returned to home hatcheries; 15 million fewer than the previous year.Hatchery salmon made up 19 percent (28 million) of the statewide commercial catch of 162 million fish in 2009, and 18 percent ($62 million) of the value, down by nearly half from the previous year. By far, chums made up Alaska’s biggest hatchery crop at 59 percent. It’s 21 percent for pinks, 16 for coho salmon, 19 for kings and just 3 percent of Alaska’s red salmon got their start in hatcheries.In some regions, ranched fish by far make up most of the salmon catches — 84 percent at Prince William Sound, worth 62 percent of the value; and 15 percent of the catch at Southeast, worth 34 percent of the value. Kodiak was the only region last year that showed solid increases for its hatchery returns. Twenty-five of Kodiak’s salmon catch came from local hatcheries, worth 21 percent of the harvest value.This year, more than 51 million fish are expected to return to Alaska hatcheries.<COL>20,000 deckhands prove difficult to track for UFA<COL>2010-03-31<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/04/fish-are-easy-on-the-stomach/<COL>Fish are easy on the stomachBy Laine WelchAlaska fish can now claim another “best” on the health front. It is the easiest protein on your tummy. That is the conclusion of the first comparative study ever done on digestibility of America’s most popular proteins.“Most people have assumed that fish is a superior source of protein, but no studies have been done to prove it,” said Dr. Scott Smiley at the University of Alaska’s Fishery Industrial Technology Center in Kodiak. “We wanted to fill that gap by studying the compositional and digestibility differences between the big protein sources: beef, pork, chicken and fish.”Alaska pollock was by far the most digestible protein, followed by Alaska salmon.“The fish came way out on top,” Smiley said. “Interestingly, chicken was the least digestible.”They all are high-quality proteins, he added, but the main distinction with cold water fish from Alaska is that it also provides omega 3 fatty acids.“Those are incredibly healthful for humans,” Smiley said. “And omegas are tremendously potent in terms of undoing the damage that saturated fatty acids associated with red meats have done over the years because of our diet.”Smiley said the Alaska scientists were “thrilled” at the study results.“We suspected this would be the case, but it is always good to see it validated through testing,” he explained. “And we tested it ‘seven ways to Sunday’ here in both laboratory and field tests. This is the kind of science that can float all boats and hopefully will make more people look to fish as their protein source.”FITC scientists collaborated on the study with researchers at the University of Illinois/Urbana. Results are published in the Journal of Animal Science.Temperature and fish takesResults from three seasons of fishing tests indicate that temperature data might be used to reduce Chinook salmon by-catch in Bering Sea pollock fisheries.A new study by John Gauvin of the Marine Conservation Alliance Foundation and Jim Ianelli of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center found that pollock primarily stayed within the two to four degrees Celsius range. Within that, king salmon by-catch was generally higher. (Chum salmon by-catch appeared to have a similar but weaker relationship with temperature.)The researchers believe temperature and depth data collections may be used by the fleet to avoid high by-catch zones.“If collections of fine-scale temperature data on Alaska fishing vessels can be continued in the future to obtain a longer time series, as well as extending this effort to the other fishing grounds, the potential clearly exists for a new and effective tool for reducing salmon and other by-catch in Alaska’s groundfish fisheries,” the study said. Alaska pollock is the largest U.S. fishery, accounting for more than one-third of total U.S. landings. Find the full report at www.mcafoundation.org.Biggest fish buzzThe issue worrying most industry stakeholders in Alaska is marine spatial planning, or “ocean zoning,” and that calls might be made outside the realm of regional fishery councils. That was the talk in the halls at the North Pacific Council meeting underway at the Anchorage Hilton.The Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, created last June by the White House, calls it a “more comprehensive approach to protecting and restoring the health of U.S. oceans and coasts.”The new spatial approach uses chart lines on huge swaths of ocean to define strict zones for all users: shipping lanes, oil and gas development, fiber optic cables, fishing areas and other marine activities.“It is already used in several other countries,” said Arne Fuglvog, fisheries aide to Senator Lisa Murkowski. “In the United States, it has been done on a state-by-state initiative.”“This is something that all of Alaska’s fisheries can get behind,” said fisheries consultant Linda Kozak of Kodiak. “There might be disagreement on other issues, but zoning our oceans affects us all.”<COL>Fish are easy on the stomach<COL>2010-04-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/04/new-aquaculture-policy-open-for-public-comment/<COL>New aquaculture policy open for public commentFish Factorby Laine WelchFederal fishery managers have begun accepting public comments on a new aquaculture policy in waters from three to 200 miles offshore. The input will guide NOAA Fisheries as it creates a regulatory framework for open-ocean fish farms.An independent Marine Aquaculture Task Force that spent two years canvassing the country and studying the issue has already urged Congress to — above all — ensure strong environmental standards are in place to regulate offshore farms.The task force recommended that NOAA Fisheries work closely with states, and that regional fishery councils not be tasked with oversight.“It doesn’t seem prudent to also have them consider how to balance aquaculture and wild capture fisheries,” Rieser added.The task force said offshore fish farms should be limited to native species, and questioned how much wild fish will be captured to feed all the farmed fish.Aquaculture already produces half of all seafood consumed in the world and is growing by 10 percent a year. The United States imports 80 percent of the fish it eats, most of it farmed.Panel member Daniel Benetti said good regulations and technology advances can address any concerns about aquaculture, and it should be expanded into a profitable new U.S. industry.NOAA is holding listening sessions around the country, including a Seattle session on April 22. At the urging of Gov. Parnell, an Alaska session was added for early May (no date yet). A two-hour national call-in is scheduled for May 6. Public comments are accepted through May 14.

The open pit copper and gold mine would be one of the largest in the world. Many are concerned about the impact the mine will have on subsistence, commercial and sport fisheries.It is the Alaska group’s second appearance at the London meeting; one year ago, they brought survey results from 35 communities that showed overwhelming opposition to the mine. This time, however, each Alaskan bought one share of Anglo stock so they can participate in the meeting.“Like any other corporation with shareholders, we will be allowed to ask questions and vote on any issues coming before the floor. That is one big difference,” said Bobby Andrew of Koliganek/Dillingham, a leader of Nunamta Aulukestai  (Caretakers of the Land) representing eight tribal villages in Bristol Bay.Also making the London trip are Everett Thompson of Naknek, George Wilson Jr. of Levelock, Lydia Olympic of Igiugig,  former Sen. Rick Halford of Chugiak and Verner Wilson of Dillingham.“Our primary message to them will be to take the statement made by Anglo American CEO Cynthia Carroll last year into consideration; that they would not do the project if it was not supported by the communities or the leaders,” said Andrew.“We have to make sure we are heard and Cynthia Carroll has to keep her promise.”Andrew said it has been very difficult to get a response from Carroll over the past year, but her communications have indicated that the company plans to pursue the project.Members of the National Resources Defense Council also will attend the annual meeting and present the mining officials with a petition containing more than 100,000 signatures opposing the Pebble Mine. The NRDC is also placing a large ad in the London Financial Times and New York Times and blogging about the trip at NRDC’s Switchboard.The Pebble Partnership, which includes Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty, plans to invest another $73 million into the project this year, and submit permit applications in 2011.Andrew says opponents of the Pebble Mine will never stop their fight to end the project.“We are not going to stop,” he said. “We will go all the way through the end.”Revenues to Alaska from the Pebble Mine (not including various taxes) are projected at 3-7 percent, according to Mike Heatwole, the Partnership’s director of Public Affairs.Fish pricesFishermen are enjoying some nice prices in most ports across Alaska. The big swings for halibut have steadied from the inflated first of the season highs that topped $6 a pound, to settle most recently into the $4-$4.50 range at major ports. About 5.8 million pounds of halibut has crossed the docks so far; or 14 percent of the catch limit. Most of the fish has been landed at Seward and Homer, followed by Kodiak and Juneau.Sablefish (black cod) is seeing strong landings with prices ranging between $5 and $6 per pound, depending on fish size. Seward, Kodiak and Homer were the top ports for sablefish landings, totaling about 4 million pounds, or 16 percent of the catch quota. Cod prices are creeping upward in the past few days, going from 28- 32 cents a pound in Kodiak. The overall supply of codfish from Alaska is up 4.6 percent from last year, topping 500 million pounds. For Gulf of Alaska fishermen, the cod quota is up 42.5 percent from 2009.Winter trollers in Southeast Alaska are seeing strong catches for king salmon, with prices dropping a bit to around $7.37 a pound, according to market watcher Ken Talley. Trollers will likely catch their limit of 45,000 winter kings.Finally, industry reports say the market for sockeye salmon is “white hot” — due in great part to disease problems that are continuing to ravage farmed fish from Chile. Prices for farmed Atlantic salmon have jumped 20.6 percent since the start of this year.Fish bitsKodiak roe herring fishermen have refused to fish for the low $200-$250 per ton offered by processors. The herring season opened on April 15. The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute now has high definition videos available of Alaska and its fisheries.

Funding comes from the Oak Foundation, an international philanthropic organization.“It has three components,” explained Linda Behnken, director of the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association. “We want to help finance local fishermen to be the next generation of halibut and sablefish quota shareholders, and provide a favorable exit opportunity for people who have quota shares now. We want the next generations to participate in taking care of the resource to make sure it is sustainably protected. And then we want to market that fish to places where people support that conservation ethic, and believe in the communities and the people who catch the fish.The Trust Funds ALFA’s Fishermen’s Conservation Network, which aims to create cleaner, lower-impact fisheries by combining science with fishermen’s knowledge of marine habitats.Right now, for example, fishermen are working together to generate three-dimensional, bathymetric maps that identify “bycatch hotspots” for rockfish. That is being combined with survey data and other habitat information from fishery managers.“Then it is given it back to the fishermen in a way that protects the confidentiality of their sets (where they are fishing), but shows areas that are consistently high in rockfish bycatch,” Behnken explained.The fishermen also are working with scientists to record acoustic data from sperm whales that rob halibut and sablefish from their hooks. Quantifying these removals strengthens fishery assessments and ensures that harvest limits accurately reflect fish abundance.The market arm of the fishermen’s network is called Alaskans Own Seafood, which claims to combine “the best in business with the best in conservation.”“We are in the early stages of working out the details for customers to pre-order locally caught fish,” Behnken said. “We want to work though our local processors so it strengthens the community as a whole — as well as local fishermen.”“In Southeast Alaska, we are constantly working on improving the quality of our fish, protecting the fisheries and maintaining healthy fishing communities,” said Sitka fisherman Jeff Farvour.Behnken added that it is all part of a bigger movement by fishermen to show they are good caretakers of the resources they and their communities depend upon for their livelihood.“Our halibut and sablefish fleet is very proud of the job they’ve done as stewards of the resource,” she said. “We believe they are best able to address any problems or challenges that come up, so managers don’t have to close big areas to deal with bycatch or other issues.”Learn more at: www.alaskansown.comCrew and skippers connectA ready workforce is standing by for jobs on Alaska fishing boats and processing plants. Since 1998, the Alaska Fishing Jobs Center has been connecting skippers and seafood companies with crews eager to work.“What we ordinarily do if we need crew is call a few buddies to see if they know of anyone, or occasionally hire a green guy. But generally speaking, you’re operating from a really small pool of people,” said AFJC originator/operator Scott Coughlin.Coughlin is a 24-year veteran of Alaska fisheries from Southeast to Nome.“I got to thinking, why shouldn’t every adventurous, motivated job-seeker who dreams of coming to Alaska have the opportunity to directly connect with Alaska permit holders and have a shot at this,” Coughlin explained.Anyone with an Alaska fishing permit can register for free at the on-line job center.“If you hold a permit to fish in Alaska, that number is already in the system. All you need to do is enter the last five numbers of your permit card and the check digit, and you’re in,” Coughlin said. “You immediately have access to hundreds of crew job applicants.”A quick glance at the www.fishingjobs.com site shows pictures of a large pool of jobseekers with diverse backgrounds in aircraft mechanics, tours in Afghanistan, students, people looking for a job change or who are unemployed, and several with extensive fishing experience in Alaska.“It is the only website that draws in skippers and puts the two groups together directly,” Coughlin said. “All I need now are a few hundred more skippers to register so that will absorb the current crop of adventurous, motivated and well-informed crew job applicants.”The job center is expanding to include a pool of workers for Alaska seafood processing companies. Coughlin said that component will be operational in about two weeks.Fish is Alaska-grown foodA Farm-to-School Act (HB 70) was passed by the Alaska Legislature this session which will facilitate increased procurement of Alaska-grown food by schools. Sponsored by Rep. Carl Gatto of Palmer, HB 70 creates a program within the state Dept. of Agriculture to give farmers, distributors and brokers more opportunities to sell produce directly to schools.“Not only would this allow students a better understanding of nutrition, but there’s also an opportunity for Alaska’s farmers and gardeners to develop a dependable new income stream,” Gatto said in a press release.What about Alaska’s farmers of the sea? No one has yet answered the question if the program includes fish.At a media teleconference the day after the legislature adjourned, Governor Parnell said he was unaware of the Farm to School Act. The House Majority Press Office responded only that the program “expressly prohibits farmed fish.” Other calls and queries to offices and industry reps went unanswered.Does the prohibition against “farmed fish” include Alaska-grown oysters and clams? Will Alaska’s fishermen be able to benefit from this “dependable new income stream” by selling to schools?No one seems able to answer that question. Meanwhile, the Farm-to-School Act is on its way to the governor for signature.<COL>Investing in future generations of fishermen<COL>2010-04-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/06/saving-the-town-of-robinson-crusoe/<COL>Saving the town of Robinson Crusoeby Laine WelchNorth Pacific fishing groups are leading an ambitious effort to save a South Pacific fishing town named Robinson Crusoe.The tsunami that followed the massive earthquake in Chile in February devastated the island community, located among the Juan Fernandez archipelago 400 miles offshore. It was here that the sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in 1704 and lived in solitude for more than four years. The sailor inspired Daniel Defoe to write the classic novel “Robinson Crusoe” in 1719. It is often considered to be the first novel in English.Today, Robinson Crusoe Island is home to 700 residents who depend entirely on a small-boat, spiny lobster fishery for their sustenance and economy.“It is the lifeblood of the community. It would cease to exist if the fisheries collapsed,” said Peter Hodum with the nonprofit “Oikonos,” which has worked within the community for a decade. “These fisheries are artisanal, and the entire island culture is founded on this traditional lobster fishery.”The tsunami in February washed away every boat and building on Robinson Crusoe, and the spring fishing season was already lost. To help the small fleet of wooden skiffs get back on the water, Hodum and a network of Pacific Northwest fishing groups are close to gathering $100,000 in cash and equipment — everything from fish hooks to batteries — to help jump-start the fishery by September.“Ranging from the winches to pull the boats up into the dry dock area each night, to fishing lines and buoys and spare motors and so forth,” Hodum said. “Once we acquire that equipment and materials, we will ship it to Chile, and then out to the islands this summer.”The rapid outpouring of support from the Pacific Northwest has been remarkable, he said, but not surprising.“They see themselves as part of a larger brotherhood; a larger community of people who fish for a living,” he said. “They recognize that they have the wherewithal to contribute to help rebuild this community. It’s very matter-of-fact.”“We are bound by the sea and our fishing heritage,” said Wally Pereyra, Chairman of Arctic Storm Management Group, who lived for a short time on Robinson Crusoe in 1972. While teaching and doing fisheries research at a Chilean university, Pereyra introduced new fishing systems, such as mechanized pot and line haulers, to fishermen at Robinson Crusoe and throughout Chile. Pereyra said the experience reminded him of fishing towns in bush Alaska — especially the Pribilofs.“I was shocked by how little it would take to make an enormous improvement in the lives of the people in this community,” said Jim Stone, a veteran Bering Sea crab fisherman. “You can spend $100,000 on a Bering Sea fishing boat in the blink of an eye, yet that is all it would take to get the entire community back on its feet. The items they need are so easily found all around the shores of the North Pacific. This is our opportunity to make a connection with people we don’t know, but who share similar life experiences on the sea.”Deadline to contribute to the Robinson Crusoe Fishing Restoration Project is June 18. Contact Edward Poulsen at (206)992-3260, or  edpoulsen@comcast.net for more information.Otter countsA project that gets underway next month aims to count sea otters throughout Southeast Alaska, where the animals pose a growing threat to several important fisheries. The two-year collaboration includes three segments, said Sunny Rice, a Sea Grant Marine Advisory agent in Petersburg.“The population estimate — which will be done by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service — a diet study will be primarily done by the School of Fisheries and Ocean Science and Sea Grant, and a tagging and tracking project funded by the North Pacific Research Board, which will be done by all of us together,” Rice said.Sea otters were hunted almost to extinction by Russian fur traders a century ago. Four hundred animals were reintroduced in six locations around the state about 45 years ago. Since then, the Alaska population has grown to about 75,000 animals. Roughly 11,500 sea otters are estimated throughout Southeast, but that was five years ago. They are able to reproduce at any time of the year and they have a population doubling time of about 5 years, said Nathan Soboleff at USFWS in Juneau.Several lucrative dive fisheries have been closed, due to presumed sea otter predation.“What we’re trying to do is estimate the take of four commercially important species by sea otters: Dungeness crab, geoduck clams, urchins and sea cucumbers,” said Zac Hoyt, a diver and research biologist. “When you’re underwater in a geoduck bed, it’s pretty amazing how efficient otters are at getting these clams that burrow a couple or three feet under the sand. It’s literally like a backhoe has been on the bottom.”At a meeting last week in Ketchikan, Phil Doherty, director of the  Southeast Alaska Regional Dive Fishery Association, said the booming otter population is a big concern.“The sea otters are primary predators of everything we fish for,” he said. “In a number of areas, they have completely wiped out the sea urchins and sea cucumber fisheries, and they are starting to make inroads into some of our geoduck areas. Over the long term, if there isn’t some sort of more active management plan for sea otters, I’m not going to say it will be completely wiped out, but it certainly will be scaled back tremendously.”Doherty added that the dive fisheries had a value of $8 million at the Southeast docks.Also worried about increased otter predation are Dungeness crab fishermen.“It will be nice to verify what we’re hearing from crabbers -— they’ll go into a bay and see evidence of sea otter predation all along the shore, and at the same time, they’re not catching any crab in their pots in that same area,” said Sunny Rice. “There is just such a lack of information for fishermen to try and make predictions about holding onto a Dungeness permit for another 15 years. If we can get data that gives them something to go on, we will have done something positive.”Shape shifterAlaska salmon has shown a big shift in the ways it goes out to market. More wild salmon is being sold as pricier fresh/frozen or fillets, instead of going into cans.According to ASMI’s Seafood Market Information Service, the wholesale value for frozen H&G (headed/gutted) salmon in the last sales quarter was $147 million, up from $128 million for the same time in 2008. Both chum and sockeye showed big value boosts; chums up 9 percent from $1.17 to $1.28 per pound, and frozen sockeye up from $2.52 to $2.74 per pound.For the priciest product form — salmon fillets — Alaska sockeye showed the most stable growth. Frozen sockeye fillets increased from 4 million to 16 million pounds from 2004 and 2009. Average wholesale price for frozen sockeye fillets increased to $5.23 per pound, marking the first time that product reached the $5-per-pound benchmark.“It’s exciting to see,” said Ray Riutta, director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. “There was a stigma a few years ago that fish had to be fresh. We’ve done a good job of changing that perception.”On the other hand, canned salmon — as a share of total salmon production — declined significantly between 2004 and 2009, from 41 percent to 30 percent. Canned sockeye production has declined steadily for four years, from 32 percent to 26 percent last year. For pinks, about 55 percent is being canned, with the rest being frozen.<COL>Saving the town of Robinson Crusoe<COL>2010-06-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/12/summer-not-alaskas-only-fishing-season/<COL>Summer: not Alaska’s only fishing seasonby Laine WelchSalmon will always be the heart of Alaska’s fisheries, and that’s why most people think of summer as the fishing season. But that’s not the case.The heart of winter is when Alaska’s largest fisheries get underway each year.On January first, hundreds of boats with hook and line gear or pots begin plying the waters of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska for Pacific cod, rockfish and other groundfish. Then on January 20th trawlers take to the seas to target Alaska pollock, the world’s largest food fishery with annual harvests topping three billion pounds.Crab boats will soon be out on the Bering Sea for snow crab, Alaska’s largest crab fishery. Early March sees the start of the eight month long halibut and sablefish (black cod) seasons. March also marks the beginning of Alaska’s roe herring circuit, usually at Sitka Sound, and those fisheries will continue for several months all the way up the coast to Norton Sound.And although wild Alaska king salmon is available from Southeast trollers for all but two weeks out of the year, mid-May is considered the “official” start of Alaska’s salmon season, when the runs of kings and reds return home to the Copper River.Salmon fisheries take center stage all summer and into the fall – that means one of Alaska’s highlights: red king crab at Bristol Bay in mid-October … and so it goes through the end and start of each and every year. In all, more than five billion pounds of fish and shellfish crosses Alaska’s docks each year and the industry puts more people to work that oil/gas, mining, timber and tourism combined.Fish watchHere are the 2015 catches for important groundfish species set by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and the percentage of change from this year (courtesy of Deckboss): Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands – Pollock, 1.3 million tons, up 3.4 percent; Pacific cod, 250,000 tons, down 1.8 percent; Yellowfin sole, 149,000 tons, down 19 percent; Atka mackerel, 54,500 tons, up 68.6 percent; Pacific Ocean perch, 32,000 tons, down 3.3 percent;Sablefish, 3,135 tons, down 0.5 percent.Gulf of Alaska – Pollock, 199,151 tons, up 13.8 percent; Pacific cod, 75,202 tons, up 16.2 percent; Pacific Ocean perch, 21,012 tons, up 8.8 percent; Sablefish, 10,522 tons, down 0.5 percent.Crabbers in Southeast Alaska had their best Dungeness crab fishery ever in terms of both catch and value. The combined summer and fall harvest topped five million pounds, well above the 10 year average of 3.78 million pound. The 137 participants in the fishery enjoyed an average price of nearly $3 a pound (compared to $2.49 last year), making the Dungie fishery worth $15 million at the Southeast docks.Seafood traditions – For centuries seafood has taken a special place on holiday tables all over the world served up with meaning.One of the oldest traditions stemming back to Roman times is the Feast of Seven Fishes, celebrated by Italian Catholics on Christmas Eve. The number seven is considered the perfect number in the Bible, and the feast symbolized the end of a month-long fast from eating meat or dairy products during Advent. One of the most popular of the seven dishes eaten is baccalà or salted codfish, along with fried fish such as smelt and calamari.Eating lutefisk is a Christmas tradition in Norway and Sweden that goes back to the days of the Vikings, and is even more popular among Scandinavian Americans. It is made from dried white fish, usually cod, that is prepared with lye in a long series of water treatments until the fish becomes jelly like.Or as Garrison Keillor wrote in Lake Woebegone Days: “Each Advent we entered the purgatory of lutefisk, a repulsive gelatinous fishlike dish that tasted of soap and gave off an odor that would gag a goat. We did this in honor of Norwegian ancestors, much as if survivors of a famine might celebrate their deliverance by feasting on elm bark.”Elsewhere, in Japan consuming prawns on New Year’s is to insure long life, and herring roe for fertility. Feasting on pickled herring at midnight in Germany and Poland is done in hopes of bringing in a bountiful catch. And in China a fish is served whole, symbolizing a good beginning and end in the coming year.One seafood that isn’t so popular in the holiday celebrations is lobster- because it swims backwards.<COL>Summer: not Alaska’s only fishing season<COL>2014-12-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2015/01/retrospective-fish-picks-and-pans/<COL>Retrospective, fish picks and pansby Laine WelchAlaska still has its share of naysayers who will quibble about the seafood industry’s importance to our great state. They dismiss the fact that fishing was Alaska’s first industry and was fish that spawned the push to statehood.“The canned salmon plants started in the 1870s and by the early 20th century, canned salmon was the largest industry and generated 80% of the territorial tax revenues. It had a position in the state economy that oil enjoys today,” said fisheries historian Bob King.The fisheries that Alaska inherited from the federal government at statehood in 1959 were in bad shape. That year the salmon catch of 25 million fish was the worst since the turn of the century, and total seafood production was just 324 million pounds. In contrast, salmon catches today often top 200 million fish, and more than five billion pounds of seafood cross the Alaska docks each year.Here are fishing notables from 2014, in no particular order, followed by my annual ‘fish picks and pans’:Alaska claimed the nation’s top three fishing ports for seafood catches last year: Dutch Harbor, Kodiak and Akutan.The 2014 salmon harvest totaled 157 million fish with a dockside value of nearly $577 million. That’s 116 million fewer salmon than last year, and a $113 million drop in value.Prince William Sound squeaked by the Panhandle to claim the year’s highest salmon catch at 49.35 million fish – topping Southeast’s landings by just 103,000 salmon.Bristol Bay’s sockeye catch of 28.8 million was 61% higher than expected and rang in at nearly $193 million at the docks. Fish forecasters said in 2015 Bristol Bay can expect the largest red run in two decades – 54 million with a harvest of 38 million.Norton Sound fishermen also saw a nice salmon payday from one of the best chum harvests in 25 years, plus the fourth best for silvers and the highest price in the state at $1.60/lb. Chums from the AYK regions fetched some of the highest prices at $.55 – $.60/lb.Salmon permits in many fisheries tripled in value since 2002. By mid-year Bristol Bay driftnet permits were listed by brokers at $150,000 to $170,000, compared to $90,000 in January. Southeast Alaska seine permits were the priciest in the state topping $300,000.Scientists discovered that crabs can hear through a small sac at the base of their antennae. Even more exciting, they found clues to determining crabs’ ages – parts of the crab stomach and eye stalks remain after molts and show bands similar to rings in a tree. It means that for the first time managers will soon know for sure how fast crabs grow, a key factor in stock assessments.Shrimp remained as America’s top seafood favorite, but salmon bumped canned tuna to take over the second spot. Each American ate 2.7 pounds of salmon, a 34% increase in one year.The pollock biomass in the Bering Sea more than doubled its ten year average to top 20 billion pounds, and the stock is healthy and growing. (The allowed catch is around 3 billion pounds.)A first lawsuit challenged a new law designed to clamp down on hired skippers fishing the halibut and sablefish quota shares owned by others. The rule took effect December 1; it bans using a hired skipper to harvest any quota acquired after Feb. 12, 2010.A massive tailings dam breach at the Mt. Polley gold/copper mine fouled lands and waters for miles in neighboring British Columbia. That began an uproar downstream at Southeast Alaska, where five huge mines are planned near watersheds that feed into some of the region’s most productive salmon rivers. Canadian officials rejected calls from Southeast and Alaska Senators for more thorough environmental reviews.More than 100 researchers and three dozen projects got underway to find clues to the seven year decline of Alaska’s king salmon. The state-backed five year, $30 million Chinook Salmon Research Initiative includes 12 major river systems from Southeast Alaska to the Yukon.Xtra-Tuf Boots partnered with the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA) to help expand training and reduce injuries to all mariners. The company sealed the deal with a $10,000 check at the Alaska State FairRussia began a yearlong ban on food products from the US and other nations over political grievances in the Ukraine. For Alaska the ban means a loss of 20 million pounds in seafood sales, mostly salmon roe and pollock surimi, valued at $60 million.Corrosive effects of ocean acids were documented by NOAA scientists on the shells of tiny, snail-like pteropods, which make up 45% of pink salmon diets. Unmanned gliders began tracking how melting glaciers may be intensifying corrosive waters in Prince William Sound.A Maritime Workforce Initiative was launched by the state Labor Dept. that targets 23 different occupation types such as fishing, research, machinists, ship building and repairs. Right now there are not enough skilled workers to meet demand.Researchers reported that nothing on retail shelves compares to the levels of antioxidants and other healthy compounds seen in Alaska seaweeds.The ‘graying of the fleet’ spawned a multi-year project to find ways to attract more young people to fishing careers. The average age of Alaska permit holders is 47, with twice as many permit holders aged 45 to 60 as there are between 30 and 44. With a $335,000 grant from the North Pacific Research Board, a team with the Alaska Marine Conservation Council and Alaska Sea Grant will focus on the Kodiak and Bristol Bay regions through 2016.Alaska processors launched a new line of pink salmon in smaller cans aimed at endurance athletes. The smaller cans also will let processors use the salmon development tax credit passed this year by the Alaska legislature to upgrade canning lines, many of which are from the 1950s.Bob Tkacz, one of Alaska’s best fishery writers, died suddenly in Juneau. Bob covered seafood industry issues for 33 years and published the weekly Laws for the Sea during the legislative sessions.Approval (or not) of genetically modified salmon, dubbed Frankenfish, remained in FDA limbo.A new Alaska Mariculture Initiative began “to grow a billion dollar industry within 30 years.” The first phase was bankrolled by a $216,812 federal grant to the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation as part of NOAA Fisheries’ national mariculture expansion policy.Slow growing halibut stocks showed signs of reversing a near decade decline that has seen commercial catches slashed by 70%. The price for halibut quota shares hit $50 per pound at Southeast Alaska, the only place where catches have increased in recent years. Dock prices for halibut topped $6/lb at major ports for much of the eight month season.A ballot measure to allow the Alaska legislature to ban large mining projects near Bristol Bay passed with a 65/35 vote. Currently, only state and federal agencies can decide on mining permits.Ocean Beauty Seafoods was awarded the 2014 Supplier of the Year by Whole Foods Markets. Whole Foods said it “admires Ocean Beauty’s partnering with port buyers to ensure fishermen are recognized and treated with respect.”Trial fisheries began for seine-caught pollock at Kodiak and Homer with little interest.Alaska seafood remained free of radiation stemming from Japan’s 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster.The EPA concluded that the Pebble Mine would be “devastating” to the Bristol Bay salmon fishery and Native culture. That set the stage for the agency to permanently ban large scale mining in the region.Federal fishery managers began a move towards a “bycatch mitigation” plan for groundfish trawlers in the Gulf of Alaska, which will include some form of catch sharing.A new Kenai-based sportfish group formed an Alaska Fisheries Conservation Alliance aimed at banning setnetting near Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula, Valdez and Juneau. It would eliminate Cook Inlet setnetters and affect 500 fishing families in all. The group is still gathering signatures to bring its case to Alaska voters.The “nation’s fish basket” was closed indefinitely by Pres.

The halibut bycatch levels, which are set by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, have not been changed for the flatfish fisheries in 20 years. Meanwhile, halibut catches for commercial and sport users have been slashed every year for a decade due to stock depletion and slow growing fish.Biggest fish story of 2014:Mark Begich’s defeat in November meant losing one of  Alaska’s most fish savvy US senators, as well as the loss of the chair of the Fisheries/Oceans/USCG committee and an Alaskan seat on Appropriations, where all those federal dollars get doled out.This is the 24th year for this weekly column that focuses on Alaska’s seafood industry. It began in the Anchorage Daily News, and now appears in over 20 newspapers and web sites, including in the UK. A spin off – Alaska Fish Radio – airs weekdays on 30 radio stations. The goal of both is to make all people aware of the economic, social and cultural importance of Alaska’s seafood industry, and to inspire more Alaskans to join its ranks.<COL>Retrospective, fish picks and pans<COL>2015-01-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/01/treadwell-touts-ocean-advocacy-in-senate-campaign/<COL>Treadwell touts ocean advocacy in senate campaignby Laine WelchGood science should drive all fisheries decisions, and Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell says he has the chops to maintain a true course.Treadwell, a Republican who hopes to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Begich in November’s election, paid a recent visit to Kodiak and “talked fish” in a brief interview.Few can claim Treadwell’s experience and understanding of the Arctic, where he has represented Alaska on U.S. Delegations in three circumpolar government groups, and been a director of the Institute of the North.  He said he “doesn’t expect any major fisheries there anytime soon.”Treadwell called ocean acidification one of the “most pressing effects” of climate change, and “one of the toughest things to adapt to.”The solutions, he believes, lie in better technology.“I have always supported trying to make our energy cleaner,” he said, pointing to potential in CO2 sequestration technology and use of hydrogen vehicles. “I believe we can and must be a proving ground for some of these new technologies.”Treadwell added that he has always been a “tireless advocate for our oceans.”“But you are not going to find me, as a responsible official from a state known for three things:  cold, dark, distance — and where people are already paying too much for energy — trying to raise their energy prices,” he said.Treadwell has played a leading role in the launch of nearly every Alaska research center from Ketchikan to Barrow; he is a past director of the state Dept. of Environmental Conservation, served as Cordova’s director of oil spill response after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and was a founder of the Prince William Sound Science Center.“I would come to the Senate with that background,” he said. I am probably one of the most scientifically savvy people to have ever served.”On the fisheries side, Treadwell believes “knowledge is power.” He said his entire career has focused on ‘commons management’ of resources, starting with his first job in Alaska as an intern to Wally Hickel when he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1974.  Treadwell helped Hickel pen his position on the 200 mile limit, and he later wrote his graduate thesis at Yale on the limit’s history going back to 1937.“I also am no stranger to the senior fisheries managers in this country. I have been part of the fight to get CDQ’s – and I will be there fighting with knowledge even if I don’t have seniority,” he said.Treadwell said he is “passionate” about protecting the livelihoods of fishermen and coastal communities.“I think of our fishermen as some of the last free people on earth and I want to make sure we maintain that freedom,” he said. “To do that, it takes three things: make sure the biology is sustained, make sure any program works economically and you don’t drive the fishermen out of business, and make sure there is equity so that you keep fishing families fishing.”“My motto to any young person is ‘never leave your government alone,’ the Senate hopeful added. “If you do, they will get their own ideas and they are not always useful to you.”Comment deadline flubNo one appears to know that a deadline to have a say on how man-made sounds affect marine mammals is January 27. Two days after Christmas, NOAA released its “Draft Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic [man made] Sound on Marine Mammals,” which seeks to improve understanding of acoustical impacts on the animals.Senator Lisa Murkowski was irate at NOAA’s untimely “holiday surprise” in announcing the opportunity for the public to comment.“This is a national issue, but when you think about Alaska, it is something that has the potential to affect our coastal communities, the maritime sector, the transit of all of our goods,   the fishing industry, oil and gas – basically anyone who is out on the water,” Murkowski said in a phone interview. “It will include the noises of seismic activity from exploratory depth soundings, or driving piles to expand a dock at the Port of Anchorage or a coastal community.”Salmon permits soarThe value of Alaska salmon permits are soaring in many fisheries.  In Bristol Bay drift gillnet permits are being offered at $140,000, compared to $90,000 at the same time last year.A scan of listings by four brokers shows that Prince William Sound seine cards are over $200,000 — they were in the $140,000 range a year ago. The Sound’s driftnet permits also are selling at over 200K.Southeast Alaska seine permits are the priciest at $320,000, up from  $250,000 last January. Kodiak seine values continued an upward creep to $50,000 compared to $36,000 on average. Chignik permits are listed in the $225,000 range. At Area M on the Alaska Peninsula drift cards were at $90,000 and seine cards at $65,000, down slightly.Cook Inlet drift permits are being offered at $85,000 or higher, which is $10,000 more than a year ago  Cook Inlet seine cards are listed in the  $65,000 range and setnets at $16,000.Cook Inlet will be the focus of the Board of Fish when it takes up 235 proposals at its meeting later this month. Fishery managers have provided a list of Frequently Asked Questions about managing king salmon on the Kenai River in advance of the meeting. It uses the 2013 season to explain escapement policies, how salmon are counted, king salmon research and more.

Crab legs and shrimp also get the nod as “romantic meals” on Feb. 14 — one of the busiest dining-out days for U.S. restaurants.In a national survey by Harris Interactive, chefs called lobster an “exotic delicacy that results in an intimate moment, because it is hand-held and shareable.” In fact, respondents called all shellfish “a catalyst for connection like no other food.”The links between seafood and love have a long history, including the belief that oysters enhance male desire and performance.Until recently, there was no scientific evidence to back that up. However, new studies by Miami and Italian researchers revealed that oysters contain compounds that prompt the release of sexual hormones.  The scent of oysters resembles the most potent female pheromone. Oysters also are loaded with zinc, a key nutrient for testosterone production in both men and women.Many “experts” have touted omega-3 fish oils as serious libido lifters because they help raise the amount of compounds that control “feel good” levels in the brain, and stimulate the release of sex hormones.Author Marrena Lindberg also sings the praises of fish oil in “The Orgasmic Diet.” Fish oil, like Viagra, increases nitric oxide levels in artery linings, she claims, which increases blood flow to the brain and sex organs. Seafoods from colder waters contain the most omega 3’s. Pacific oysters pack a special punch at 1700 micrograms, the same as Alaska king salmon.The Alaska seafood with the most omega’s of all? Sablefish.Salmon LoveThe Salmon Project is spreading the love on Valentine’s Day with special “salmon swag” gift packs created by women whose biggest passion is fish.“We feel like it is a natural holiday for us to help celebrate,” said Erin Harrington, director of The Salmon Project. “One of our brands and one of the key ideas that people really recognize about the Salmon Project is the concept of salmon love.”Since 2012, the Salmon Project has been undertaking in-depth, widely traveled scientific public opinion research to better understand Alaskans’ relationships with salmon.For the Valentine’s Day promotion, Harrington hooked up with Claire and Emma Laukitis of Homer, (aka the Salmon Sisters.) The trio created “his and hers” selections of their popular Salmon Love hoodies for women, and a new Lifeblood t-shirt design for men.“It really speaks to how salmon are the lifeblood of Alaska,” said Claire. “That is something we hear from people over and over again.”Salmon Love packs also include handcrafted salmon soap by Melissa Bravo of Kodiak and salmon rubs from Summit Spice in Anchorage. Check out other products at www.aksalmonsisters.com/Fish watchThe Alaska pollock fishery opened Jan. 20 to trawlers in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska; those fleets also will target cod, perch, flounder and other groundfish. Bering Sea crabbers were nearing 40 percent of their 61 million-pound snow crab quota. About 6 million pounds remain in the 15 million-pound Tanner crab catch.A Tanner crab and golden king crab fishery will open concurrently in Southeast Alaska on Feb. 13. The Tanner fishery will be assessed after five days to see how many pots are on the grounds. Stocks are looking good, and last year’s take of more than 1.25 million pounds was the best in 13 years. The limit for golden king crab is 336,000 pounds.Also at Southeast, the demersal shelf rockfish season opened on Feb. 6, and includes seven different rockfish species with a combined catch of 72,000 poundsBlack rockfish is another catch around Kodiak, while jig and pot boats await a state water cod opener in a few weeks. A pot cod fishery opened Feb. 9 at Dutch Harbor to boats under 58 feet. Up next is the  halibut fishery that opens Mar. 14. The herring fishery at Sitka Sound should follow soon after.Mmmm, a maggot mealMix up a batch of manure, flies and fish guts and you end up with a maggot-based meal that’s irresistible to fish.Idaho University scientists (and others around the world) have developed a maggot-based fish feed that also devours manure and fish wastes. Idaho is America’s largest producer of farmed rainbow trout, and with a half million cows, it also is the nation’s fourth-biggest dairy state.But along with all those cows come billions of pounds of poop. With fish meal prices skyrocketing and mountains of manure piling up, Idaho researchers created something cheaper,  that also eats up tons of dung and fish guts in the process.Enter black soldier flies; used widely in Asia to eat restaurant wastes. In tests by animal-waste management engineers, the flies quickly reduced 700 buckets of cow manure by half, and seeded it with their eggs. Two months later, fish guts from local farms were added to the brew to enrich the maggots with omega fatty acids.They were then cleaned, frozen, ground up and fed to rainbow trout in test stations along the Snake River. The fish snapped up the feed, which made sense to the scientists, since flies are a far more natural fish food than corn and soybean-based feeds.Waste engineers believe it could become an important niche industry for Idaho’s dairy farmers who can count on their cows to produce 30 billion pounds of manure each year.Giving backAmerican Seafoods Company is accepting applications for its Alaska community grant program. A total of $38,000 will be donated to projects that address  hunger, housing, safety, education, research, natural resources and cultural activities.The majority of grant awards range from $500 to $3,000 per organization.Deadline to apply is Feb. 17.

It really opens the door to more innovators,” said Julie Decker, executive director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, which has hosted the Symphony for 22 years as a way to showcase new Alaska seafood products. The event always attracts a wide array of entries from major companies to small ‘mom and pops.’Whereas the retail, food service, and smoked contest entries always feature tasty new fish and shellfish dishes, the new category literally goes beyond the plate.“It can be anything from fish oil capsules to salmon leather wallets,” Decker said, adding that AFDF hopes to attract people who might not be aware of the Symphony, or who haven’t participated before.“I personally believe that creativity is a key to solving some of our challenges in a positive way, and that’s what we focus on with the Symphony of Seafood,” Decker said.Deadline to enter new products for the 2015 competition is Dec. 31. All entries will be judged at a Seattle soiree on Feb. 5. Winners will be announced at a yet to be dated Symphony in Anchorage, followed by another gala in Juneau. Top winners in the four categories get a free trip and booth space at the International Boston Seafood Show in March. www.afdf.orgGet with the gurry, Alaska – Alaska’s annual fish wastes top one million metric tons (2.2 billion pounds) but the bulk is not making its way into new markets. In fact, production of fish meals and oils has declined, and state figures only appear through 2009.Based on figures from the Commercial Operators Annual Report  at the state Dept. of Commerce,  total pounds of fish meal production in Alaska declined from 111.5 million pounds in 2000 to 68.5 million pounds in 2009.  The volume of fish oil more than doubled and the price increased fourfold between 2000 and 2009 with eleven million pounds of fish oil worth $2 million processed in 2000 compared with 22.7 million pounds worth $7.5 million in 2009 (inflation adjusted to 2009 dollars). The number of fish oil processors ranged from a high of 19 in 2001 to just three in 2008, while the number of fish meal processors declined from a high of 62 in 2001 to 12 through 2009.How old is that crab?  Knowing the age compositions of marine stocks is crucial to sustainable management. Fish can be aged easily by examining their ear bones (otoliths) or scales. Not so with crabs, because they molt.“For years it’s been assumed that crabs that don’t retain their hard parts throughout their lifetime due to growth by molting, at which they lose their exoskeleton. It was always assumed everything went with that,” said Joel Webb, a researcher at ADF&G’s age determination unit in Juneau.But about three years ago, researchers in Australia and Eastern Canada produced evidence to the contrary.“Parts of the crab (and shrimp) stomach and the eye stocks are retained through the molt and may be retained through the lifetime,” Webb explained. “And if you process those structures into very thin sections and look at them under a microscope and shine light through them, there are band patterns present similar to rings in a tree, otoliths or scales used to age fish.”Researchers always are trying to determine how many crabs die of natural causes like old age, Webb said, because that death rate is factored in to annual fishing quotas.“It’s a key parameter – when you know how big an organism is and what age it is, you know fast it grows. The growth rates and mortality rates are key pieces of information for fisheries management and stock assessments,” Webb said.Studies are ongoing in Juneau to apply the aging technique with red king crab, Tanner crab and spot shrimp from Southeast Alaska, and preliminary evidence is showing promising results. It might be three to five years before the aging process transfers to the fisheries, Webb said, adding that it will be “transformative.”“It’s a phenomenal thing because the availability of age information is transformative for what we know about how these organism grow and survive,” Webb said.  “Those are two key pieces of uncertainty as to how we currently manage and assess these populations and set our harvest rates.  The availability of accurate information would shift the paradigm in what we know.”Researchers estimate it takes male king and Tanner crabs five to six years before they are big enough for harvest. Soon, they’ll know for sure.Buyback ok, but how?  Trimming the number of salmon fishermen at Bristol Bay has been discussed for decades. When limited entry began in the 1970s, the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission adopted an optimum number of 1,669 permits for the Bay’s drift gillnet fishery. Ten years ago, a CFEC study concluded that an optimum range of 900 to 1,400 permits would provide a “reasonable balance of economic, conservation and fishery management concerns.”Today there are 1,858 drift permits active at Bristol Bay. A buyback would retire 300 – 500 boats from the fishery.At a packed Expo gathering last month in Seattle, a majority of permit holders said that favored reducing the fleet.“When the question was raised of do you support a fleet reduction, probably 2/3 of the folks raised their hands. Then when the question was focused down to how many of you prefer a buyback, it dropped to about a third,”  said Sue Aspelund, executive director of the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association, which is operated and funded by drift fishermen with a one percent tax on their catches.At issue is how to pay for a permit buyback, which would likely come in the form of a hefty federal loan to be repaid by the fleet.Aspelund said the RSDA will survey drift permit holders again to see if they want a second study to analyze the socio-economic impacts of a buyback.“I think that’s the study that a lot of people, especially in the Bay, are really interested in,” Aspelund told KDLG. “The take home is how is it going to affect real people living in Alaska who are really dependent on that fishery.”The BBRSDA will organize and fund the study; it has not taken a position on the permit buyback.<COL>Seafood innovators see the ‘glurry’ in fish guts<COL>2014-12-22<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2015/01/snow-crab-and-sockeyes-to-flood-2015-fisheries/<COL>Snow crab and sockeyes to flood 2015 fisheriesby Laine WelchAlaska seafood marketers are facing some strong headwinds heading into 2015, notably, for sockeye salmon and crab.Snow crab is Alaska’s largest crab fishery, underway now in the Bering Sea. The fleet has a slightly increased 61 million-pound catch quota; boats also are tapping on a hefty bairdi Tanner crab catch, the larger cousin of snow crab.A 25 percent increase in snow crab, the unexpected 15 million pound Tanner fishery, a weak Japanese yen, plus several million pounds of Russian snow crab from a new fishery in the Barents Sea, (not to mention all the pirated crab) – all are combining to give buyers plenty of choices, said market expert John Sackton.Another twist: lower king crab prices have given retail and foodservice buyers more alternatives, including a new entry – Argentinean Southern red king crab.Global market forces are also causing downward pressure on Alaska sockeye prices. The unanticipated big run at Bristol Bay had processors producing more frozen reds than expected (while at the same time the 10 million sockeye catch from the Fraser River took some of the wind out of Alaska’s fresh sales).In the face of another huge sockeye salmon run expected at the Bay again this summer, unsold sockeye inventory remains piled up in freezers.According to reports by Japan’s Minato-Tsukiji, frozen H&G (headed and gutted) production topped 20,000 tons, and — in the face of another huge sockeye run to Bristol Bay this summer — “the industry believes that 5,000-8,000 tons of products are unsold, because buyers in the EU and USA could not catch up with the high prices.”Adding to the mixA record numbers of farmed salmon are coming into the U.S. from Norway and Chile. (A strong U.S. dollar means it’s cheaper for the U.S. to buy foreign fish, and more expensive for other countries/currencies to buy U.S. seafood.) Food commodities tracker Urner-Barry reports that Chile’s farmed coho volumes last year were the highest since a virus wiped out their fish farms in 2010.And Russia’s ongoing seafood ban prompted Norway to turn to the U.S. as an alternative market. U.S. sales of fresh fillets through the third quarter reached 18.5 million pounds, a five-year high. The holidays boost seafood demand, and Urner-Barry said the upswing could carry over into the New Year. The Lenten season begins early – on February 18, just four days after Valentine’s Day.Halibut hot seatAmidst some optimism that the Pacific halibut stocks appear to be stabilizing, the stage is set for some tension when halibut managers and stakeholders gather for the International Pacific Halibut Commission’s annual meeting later this month in Vancouver. The IPHC, which oversees halibut science and harvests from Oregon through British Columbia to the Bering Sea, will set catch limits, fishery start and end dates and take up regulation proposals.Only one catch limit comment was submitted by the Dec. 31 deadline. To reduce handling and wastage in the fishery, the Seattle-based Fishing Vessel Owners’ Association is asking the IPHC to reduce the minimum size requirement for commercially caught halibut from 32 inches to 30 inches. The FVOA claims that, based on observer data, a two inch size reduction could reduce handling by 58 percentage and wastages from 1.35 million pounds to .58 million pounds.Two regulation proposals will be considered: one would set a maximum size limit for halibut in both the commercial and sport sectors. Protecting the larger fish, which are the breeders, would help the halibut stocks replenish at a faster pace, it recommends. A second halibut charter proposal suggests retaining a first 29 inches – or less halibut in the Central Gulf to decrease throwbacks of injured fish.The biggest fish story in the room will be Alaska’s halibut bycatch problem, and driving the tension is a perverse situation in the Bering Sea.The IPHC doesn’t set bycatch levels; that falls to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The NPFMC in December allotted six million pounds of halibut as bycatch to Seattle-based trawlers in the two billion pound Bering Sea flatfish fisheries (based on a formula that has not been adjusted for 20 years). That left just 370,000 pounds for small boat halibut fishermen at the Pribilof Islands for the upcoming fishery, a 70% reduction. At that harvest level, the IPHC estimates that 93 percent of all halibut removals in the Bering Sea would be from bycatch and not the directed fishery.The communities of St. Paul and St. George, along with the six Alaskan members of the NPFMC and Dept. of Fish and Game Interim Commission Sam Cotton, sent an emergency request to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce seeking a 33 percent reduction in the 2015 halibut bycatch limits in the groundfish fisheries.The IPHC next  meets Jan. 26-30 in downtown Vancouver. The meetings are streamed live at www.iphc.int/Salmon at a glanceEverything you want to know about Alaska’s 2014 salmon season — prices, sales, harvests, exports and more – is available new Seafood Market Information bulletins from the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. The bulletins, compiled by the McDowell Group in Juneau, cover every salmon species and region, and show yearly comparisons from 2010. They reflect all the preliminary tallies of the salmon season, but don’t include bonuses or retro payments.Some highlights:The 2014 salmon catch of 157 million fish was the 27th year in a row that the catch has topped 100 million. Southeast had its best Chinook salmon harvest since 2005 at 423,000 fish. Bristol Bay’s 29 million sockeye catch was the largest since 2010, although the average size of the fish was the smallest in over 15 years. Kodiak salmon fishermen grossed $46 million, the lowest since 2010.Alaska’s Revenue Department tracks sales of salmon products all year – fresh and frozen, fillets, canned and roe. May through August reflects more than 90 percent of the year’s fresh salmon sales and gives a hint of how wholesale markets are responding to the recent harvest. Prices for most salmon products were down, except for frozen pinks and chums, called keta in the ASMI bulletin. Salmon roe sales changed dramatically in 2014, down 55 percent from the year before. (There’s that Russian seafood ban kicking in for pink salmon roe sales.)Seafood is still Alaska’s most valuable export totaling $2.6 billion from January through last September. Our number one customer is China, doubling Japan’s purchases. South of the border: Seafood sales to Brazil last year were up more than 400 percent. www.alaskaseafood.orgSymphony of Seafood dates: Thursday, Feb. 5 at 5 p.m, Palace Ballroom, Seattle, WA; Tuesday, Feb. 17 at 6 p.m/ Rockwell Ballroom, Juneau; Saturday, February 21 at 6 p.m., Hilton Ballroom Anchorage; March 15-17, Boston, MA, Seafood Expo North America. www.afdf.org<COL>Snow crab and sockeyes to flood 2015 fisheries<COL>2015-01-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2015/01/walkers-fisheries-transition-team-recommends-putting-fish-first/<COL>Walker’s Fisheries Transition Team recommends putting ‘fish first’by Laine WelchThe need for a clear “fish first” policy in Alaska tops the list of priorities compiled by the Fisheries Transition Team for Governor Bill Walker. The group also stated that, “fish and fishermen in Alaska are viewed as barriers to development,” and that there is “irreplaceable optimism” that fish can coexist with development at any scale.Fisheries was just one of the topics 250 Alaskans brainstormed about in 17 teams that newly elected Walker convened in late November. Their task was to identify the top five priorities in diverse categories, as well as the barriers to success and ways to overcome them. Their reports  were released to the public last week.The 25-member fisheries team, which included commercial, sport, subsistence and science stakeholders, strongly recommended re-enacting the Coastal Zone Management Program in its “fish first” priority list. They also said no significant loss of fish habitat should knowingly be permitted in the state.Roadblocks to success are cited as lack of scientific data due to lack of money, and “subversion of science to politics.” They called it a “myth” that fish, nature or habitat can be recreated, or that wild runs can be replaced with hatchery fish. The transition report also said that, “the economic value of fisheries is undervalued and not understood, and the monetary dollar value of clean water and habitat is not understood.”No. 2 on the transition list is to, “prioritize and improve fishery access for Alaskans.” That includes creating State funds or fishery trusts to recapture fishing licenses, permits or IFQs (with a subset for young entries), and allowing “community entities” to do the same. The report also recommends making it easier for small-scale processors and marketers to operate, and eating more locally caught seafood.Adequate funding for ADF&G and fisheries science is ranked as the No. 3 priority.No. 4 is that fisheries should be managed based on science over politics, with several suggestions for Board of Fish reforms.Finally, the team prioritized locally based, adaptive fisheries management. They recommend that area managers be based year-round in the regions they manage, and that lawmakers and administrators get out and listen to Alaskans in far-flung places. Find Transition Team reports atwww.gov.alaska.govIceland leads in adding valueIceland is a top fishing nation and leads the world in turning fish parts into high-value marine products. State and Alaska seafood company representatives recently visited to learn more about how Iceland does it.“The purpose was to increase our knowledge about the new full utilization technologies that Iceland companies are using to produce a variety of high value marine goods,” said Matt Catterson, an economist with the Alaska Dept. of Commerce and Economic Development which organized the trade mission. “It’s what they’re known for.”The Iceland Ocean Cluster, Juneau Economic Development Council and the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute also participated.The two countries share similar challenges in developing high-value products from fish parts, Catterson said, but Iceland has some clear advantages.“Iceland is a unique place in a lot of ways,” he said. “They have really abundant and inexpensive energy from all their geo-thermal resources; and they have great logistic connections within their country and to the European market.”One thing that really stood out was Iceland’s “collaborative culture,” especially with biotech companies and academia.“It’s a model that doesn’t really exist yet in Alaska, where smaller biotech companies associated with the university in Iceland have partnered with some of the larger seafood companies to produce these high-value marine products from fish wastes,” Catterson said. “They include a variety of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, as well as basic marine ingredients like collagen or other enzymes that have really valuable commercial applications worldwide.”Nine Alaska seafood companies are currently producing fish oils and meals, which is nothing new, and the volume and value has ticked upward steadily since 2010. The value of 25 million pounds of fish oils produced in 2013, for example, was $15 million; a $3 million increase since 2010. Many companies are already creating products from fish parts, such as Trident’s oil supplements and pet treats. Last week, Bering Select in Dutch Harbor began producing omega-3 products from cod, and the Alyeska Plant in Dutch (a Pacific Seafoods subsidiary) has started to produce collagen.“The global trend is utilizing all of the resources,” Catterson said. “There isn’t necessarily going to be more fish available to catch and process, so increasing the value of what you catch and process is how the industry will grow in Alaska. And this is not news to any of the seafood companies operating here.”Salmon milt magicSalmon sperm — or milt — is being called a miracle product by Japanese researchers for its ability to extract rare earth elements from various wastes.It turns out that salmon sperm has phosphate in its DNA, and previous studies showed that phosphate on the surface of some bacteria extracted rare earth elements. To test the idea, the researchers poured dried salmon milt into a beaker containing liquid ore waste. The semen did indeed absorb several rare elements from the solution, which were easily extracted using a centrifuge. And, the milt did it 10 times more efficiently than conventional methods.The scientists claim salmon sperm could someday replace the hazardous chemicals currently used to extract rare earth elements. And take note Alaska: the Japanese researchers said that before salmon milt can replace industrial pollutants, “cooperation from commercial fisheries will be required” … and “infrastructure will have to be set up for capturing and processing it at its source.”The scientists noted that the milt is very easily stored in its dried form.It’s not the first time salmon sperm DNA has been called a miracle. It was the first biological material ever used in LED lighting, now found everywhere.Photonics expert Dr. Andrew Steckl at the University of Cincinnati said it is the unique shape of the salmon DNA that produces the bio-magic. He added that the semi-conductor and flat panel display industries fear that the rare specialty metals they need to make their devices will soon run out. Steckl believes plentiful biomaterials will help save the day.“We have one of the biggest and most competitive industries in America with agriculture and fishing,” he said, “and it produces huge amounts of biomaterials that can be used in many different ways.”Fish corrections:The new Juneau Resources Weekly publication began distribution by email on Jan. 23, not in February.

The world’s largest grocer announced the expanded commitment to Alaska seafood last week.“We are so proud to bring these to our customers, and we also know how important it is to local fishermen and folks across the state,” said John Forrest Ales, Director of Corporate Communications for Walmart.Company stores already carry Alaska halibut and sockeye salmon. Added to the mix now is Alaska cod loins and fillets, coho, keta and king salmon, rockfish, sole  and Alaska king and snow crab.Also debuting last week: The Alaskan, from Trident Seafoods, featuring separately bagged items that include grilled salmon, pollock fillets, whitefish burgers and more.“We’re particularly excited about our expanded assortment which is highlighted by our exclusive line of The Alaskan,” Ales said in a phone interview. “These items are new, 100 percent Alaska seafood products exclusively for us. They’re all caught in those great Alaska waters and processed locally either in the state or in the Pacific Northwest.”The new partnership with Trident, Ales added, is Walmart’s “Made in the USA Manufacturing Initiative” in action.“In 2013 we committed to American renewal by announcing that we intend to help boost job creation here in the U.S., along with manufacturing, and we’re going to do that by buying an additional $250 billion in products that support American jobs by 2023,” he said.Walmart operates 11,202 stores in 27 countries. Might the Alaska seafood blitz extend to other stores?“We’re always listening to our customers and providing the assortments and items they want,” Ales said. “We know customers in all parts of the world recognize that Alaska produces high quality seafood; it’s a premium item with great dependability and great taste. And as our customers seek those items out, we absolutely want to be there to make these products available and to meet their needs from store to store and community by community.”Get growing!Grow what you’ve got is the trend in Juneau as the way to boost and sustain its economy. Last week’s annual Innovation Summit showcased ideas in four clusters: oceans, visitors, forests and renewable energy.“In an advanced economy like the U.S. and Europe, most of the growth comes from new ideas,” said summit host Brian Holst, executive director of the Juneau Economic Development Council, host of the Summit. “We’ve tapped out most of our opportunities to just pull resources out of the ground or water, so real growth happens when we innovate.”It also promoted the cluster-based model of growing an economy, which recognizes the strengths in a region and encourages building on those strengths.“Clusters are concentrations of businesses in a particular region that rely on a similar labor market,” Holst explained. “These firms complement each other, but also compete. Think of the seafood industry, tourism, visitor products: Those businesses that bring in money from Outside are especially important for our economy.”“We know that 95 percent of jobs come from industries that already exist within an economy,” Holst said. “A lot of people say, “Let’s attract a new company or industry into a town or region,” but that is very difficult and the return is very low. The best return is to focus and grow what you have.”The Ocean Products Cluster for the region is focusing on growing the mariculture industry, a sea otter garment business and full utilization of fish parts.Juneau has become a busy fishing town, Holst said, All combined, it’s the community’s largest employer. He believes there is heightened awareness of the seafood industry’s importance in the Capitol city.“I believe Juneau recognizes that the ocean and ocean harvests are going to be part of who we were, who we are and who we will be in the future,” Holst said, “We want to invest in and support the industry.”‘But’s up!Alaska’s 2015 halibut catch is 21.2 million pounds, an overall increase for the first time in a decade, and nearly 1.5 million pounds higher than last year. The International Pacific Halibut Commission finalized the numbers at its annual meeting on Jan.30. All but two Alaska regions will enjoy slightly bigger harvests. Here are the catch limits in millions of pounds, and comparisons to 2014.The 2015 halibut season begins on March 14 and ends on Nov. 7.Seafood trendsSeafood eating trends and market outlooks were a focus of the Global Seafood Market Conference last week in Las Vegas. Undercurrent News provided highlights and predictions by a wide range of experts at its on-site blog:For halibut, strong demand and high prices for fresh fish is set to continue, with halibut almost exclusively seen today at high end restaurants.Markets for tilapia, a tasteless farmed whitefish, continues to grow, with most of it coming from Mexico, Central and South America. Honduras increased its U.S. market share from 28 to 38 percent last year. Global tilapia production is pegged at 4.7 million metric tons this year, or more than 10 billion pounds.Alaska Pollock is the fish to push, said food service reps, because “anything can be done with it” and it is sustainably abundant.Prices for fresh Pacific cod fillets should increase due to drops in production on the east coast, and a 100,000 ton cut in the Barents Sea cod quota.For four years Sablefish Canada of British Columbia has been shipping farmed sablefish (black cod) from its Saltspring Island facility to white tablecloth restaurants in the U.S. and Asia. The goal is to produce one million sablefish annually. Sablefish are tough to grow and very carnivorous. It took 10 years before they were successful, a company spokesman said. Most of the world’s sablefish comes from Alaska, where the supply picture is flat.More U.S. oyster growers are following the lead of wine makers by promoting the regions where their shellfish come from. More production is needed to meet demands, as regulations, water quality and limited hatchery production are limiting supplies in the Lower 48. Ocean acidification also was cited as a threat to shellfish mariculture.Panelists said world currency weaknesses will hurt frozen sockeye sales this year. The Canadian dollar, British Pound, Euro, Yen and Norwegian Kroner all have plummeted — making it more expensive for them to buy Alaska sockeye. The market for pink salmon, however, is still strong.Jumbo Humboldt squid, which can grow to five feet, are continuing to move north to Alaska with red flags they could slam the salmon fishery. The squid are very aggressive predators that eat everything in their path.<COL>Walmart expands lineup of Alaska seafood offerings<COL>2015-02-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/06/smart-phones-track-tagged-fish/<COL>Smart phones track tagged fishBy Laine WelchIt’s back to the drawing board for halibut iTags that will soon tell us more about where the fish travels  than ever before.The internal tags, which were deployed in 30 halibut two years ago, were the first to test Smart Phone geomagnetic advances to track the migrations of fish.  The tags record magnetic field strength on three axises and have accelerometers and pitch and roll detectors, explained Tim Loher, a biologist with the International Pacific Halibut Commission.“Without being able to tell whether or not your tag is horizontal, you can’t really get the axis of the magnetism.  The invention of the iPhone pointed the way to make the pitch and roll detectors small enough to put in fish tags,” he said.The geomagnetic tags, which can record data every 30 seconds for seven years, are designed to give real time, daily positions on halibut and track them without any need for light, acoustics or communication with GPS satellites – all the information will be onboard when the fishermen catch them.But in the field tests, magnetism was the gut tags’ undoing.“The tags had some metal components inside them that were actually picking up magnetic charges and screwing up the calibrations,” Loher said.He added that a new metal-free version of the tags already has been developed, and will be deployed in Glacier Bay halibut  later this summer by project associate Julie Nielsen, a graduate student at UAF/Juneau.  Within a couple of years, the IPHC team plans to tag 1,000 or more halibut from Oregon to Attu.“We’ve got a lot of migration issues and we are trying to set our quotas and determine exactly how to assess the stock,” Loher said. “We know the halibut  are moving but we are having trouble getting refined estimates of movement by size, age and regulatory area, so hopefully this will help nail that down. It’s going to be a really powerful experiment..”The IPHC will pay a $500 reward for the return of any geomagnetic tags (which are accompanied by external wire tags).  Rewards ranging from $50-$200 also are paid for returns of halibut containing darts or wire tags.  www.iphc.washington.eduProfiler payoutsWater column profilers that provide ocean data are still sitting on the ocean floor and scientists hope to get them back. The profilers, purchased by the IPHC with a  half million dollar grant from NOAA Fisheries, were deployed four years ago at more than 1,200 halibut survey stations between Oregon and the Bering Sea. They measure salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll content, and the data is shared with many users.One profiler was lost off the east side of Kodiak; another disappeared on the south side of Adak. The 60 pound profilers are housed in a steel cage and could be snagged on the bottom or detected with depth sounders.“Particularly the one that is off Kodiak Island,” said Bruce Leaman, IPHC executive director.  “It doesn’t have the floats on top but it’s sitting on hard bottom and you would get a little bit of a bump in there. The one that is off Adak Island, you can actually see the floats on your echo sounder if you’re going by.”The IPHC will pay a $1,500 reward for the return of the profilers.“We   hope the money is incentive enough so people will actually go looking for them,”Leaman said.  “It’s a small thing in a large area but we have some fairly precise location information and  we would dearly like to get them back because they   have important data,  plus they are reusable and are durable pieces of equipment.”Daily salmon trackerYou can now track Alaska salmon catches by region and species on a daily basis with ADF&G’s popular Blue Sheet.  Starting this season, salmon managers made the change from weekly to daily catch updates from mid-May through September.A glance at the Blue Sheet through Monday showed that the total salmon catch had topped two million fish, most coming from the Copper River/Prince William Sound region; the remainder from the westward region.Along with the daily blue sheet, ADF&G also provides a weekly in-season summary that graphs the progression of commercial salmon harvests and compares it with the five year averages.More cod comingThe global cod glut is likely to continue into 2014 as quotas are expected to increase again in Norway, Russia and Iceland.  Market expert John Sackton said the Barents Sea cod catch could increase to 993,000 metric tons. That is seen as a peak, based on the age structure of the stock, but when declines begin in 2015 they are not expected to be significant, Sackton said.Iceland has announced another increase in its  cod quota to 215,000 tons next year, up 10%.  Researchers said Iceland’s cod spawning stock is the largest since the early 1960s.In Alaska, Pacific cod accounts for 11% of  total fish landings.  Harvest levels from the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska were set at about 320,000 tons this year and are not expected to change much in 2014.Unlike Alaska crab or wild salmon, cod has no special brand and is lumped in as a “whitefish” commodity. A portion of the Alaska cod pack goes to US markets as fillets, but most goes to China for reprocessing.<COL>Smart phones track tagged fish<COL>2013-06-19<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/07/stupid-robots-to-replace-fishery-observers/<COL>‘Stupid robots’ to replace fishery observersBy Laine WelchIf a picture is worth a thousand words, get ready for millions of undersea images; all brought to you by a handmade, high-definition undersea camera.“Alaska Cam Sled is a towed imaging system that takes a lot of high-resolution pictures of the bottom of the ocean,” said Gregg Rosenkranz, a state scallop biometrician based in Kodiak.Rosenkranz and his colleague, Rick Shepherd, built the cam sled, which lets them experience a live stream of the sea floor while onboard a research vessel. They hail it as a non-invasive way to observe and collect data in real time.“We found out pretty quickly after we started doing this about six or seven years ago that there is a lot of other stuff down there, for example, a lot of Tanner crabs live in the same areas as scallops do.“I like to think of it as a really stupid robot that does one job really well, and that is to take high-resolution photos,” Rosenkranz said, adding:  “It’s easier and cheaper than a lot of other ways, because it is towed. You’re not sending divers down there for example, who get tired out.”The Alaska Cam Sled will be showcased at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Sept. 26-28 in Kodiak.  www.aaas.org/Fish cam fast trackMeanwhile, Senator Lisa Murkowski is pressing federal managers for faster action on getting fish cams to monitor catches on small fishing boats.“With today’s advanced technology, NOAA Fisheries can figure out an electronic monitoring system that works for small fishing businesses,” Murkowski said in a phone interview.The EMS would replace fishery observers now required on halibut longline vessels during trips.“That is the one thing I’ve heard as I’ve been out walking the docks,” she said. “People take me onto their boats and say, ‘Where are you going to put an observer on this vessel that has room for three, maybe four?’”Murkowski said it troubles her that a crewmember often gets left behind to accommodate an observer, which affects the efficiency and safety of the fishing trip.She added, “I understand the data is important. I’m just saying we can be smarter in how we collect it.”Salmon scrambleA lackluster Alaska salmon fishery, combined with shortfalls in farmed fish, has buyers struggling to fill orders for U.S. customers.The statewide salmon catch has topped 81 million, less than half way to the 180 million fish forecast. It will take those hard-to-predict pink salmon to get us there. State managers anticipate a harvest of nearly 120 million humpies, 73 percent higher than last year.The pink numbers are adding up fast; already half of the total salmon catch is made up of pinks, mostly from Prince William Sound (26 million). The biggest push is still to come from Southeast Alaska, where a catch of 54 million pinks is predicted this summer.Trade reports say supplies for wild and farmed salmon are down across the board and prices are increasing for both. Notably, Alaska’s sockeye harvest was disappointing; at the same time, shipments of farmed salmon from Chile are on hold pending FDA inspections for a banned chemical.‘But’s upRemember two years ago when people were aghast at halibut quota share prices hitting $30 a pound? It’s gone even higher. A scan of top brokers shows the asking price has reached $50 for some IFQs in Southeast Alaska, with most going for $40-$43 per pound. Prices for halibut shares in the Central Gulf were ranging from $30-$38.   For sablefish, quota shares in Southeast were going from $26 to $32; slightly higher at west Yakutat, and in the $20-$30 range in the Central Gulf.Fish bitsThe year’s first red king crab fishery is underway at Norton Sound with a half-million pound quota. The Dungeness crab fishery in Southeast will end Aug. 8, a week earlier than usual, with a 2.25-million-pound projected catch.The golden king crab fishery begins way out along the Aleutians on Aug. 15, where more than 6 million pounds will be hauled up. Pollock boats are fishing in the Bering Sea, and pollock reopens in the Gulf on Aug. 25.Comments extendedNoting the comment period falls at the height of Alaska’s fishing season, NOAA Fisheries has extended the public comment period for the proposed halibut catch share plan for commercial and charter operators through Aug. 26. The plan, which will allocate fish between the two sectors in Southeast Alaska and the Central Gulf, is scheduled to be in place next year.For more information, please check outwww.regulations.gov<COL>‘Stupid robots’ to replace fishery observers<COL>2013-07-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2015/01/seafood-marketers-bring-global-media-blitz/<COL>Seafood marketers bring global media blitzby Laine WelchAlaska seafood marketers are ramping up promotions and bankrolling a $1 million global media blitz to counteract a tough sockeye salmon market.Sockeyes are by far the most valuable salmon catch, often worth two-thirds of the value of Alaska’s entire salmon fishery. But last summer’s unexpected surge of reds left lots of inventory in freezers, and record U.S. imports of competing farmed salmon from Chile and Norway combined with the prospect of another big run at Bristol Bay make for a sockeye sales squeeze.Alaska’s approach will be patterned after the $1 million canned pink salmon campaign, when the record catch in 2013 plugged that market, said Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute Communications Director Tyson Fick.“We’re targeting — in particular — the UK, Japan and Canada with canned sockeye, and domestically with retailers to the tune of 6,000-7,000 individual stores to run sockeye promotions through the spring, as well as a joint promotion with Chateau St. Michele that will reach another 10,000 or so stores,” Fick said.The campaign also will advertise in overseas media, and — as with pink salmon — work directly with retailers and distributors to move product and “move the needle on awareness. ““We look to take advantage of some of the larger food trends – knowing where your food comes from, local seafood, clean waters — things like that,” Fick said.It’s a good strategy, but he admits there are many factors over which the industry has no control, including currency exchanges, international global politics and what not.“But the whole idea of this marketing operation is to buffer that and to — at all times — have a preference for Alaska out there,” Fick said. Referring to the pink campaign that has kept sales steady, he added: “All of the data coming back indicates it’s working pretty well.”New products debutThe Alaska Symphony of Seafood attracted 17 new products for its 22nd-annual competition. The contest showcases new seafood items in retail, food service and smoked categories with top winners getting a trip to the Boston Seafood Show.This year, the Symphony added a Beyond the Plate category for fish parts, which attracted five entries: Baltica Style Fish Broth by Ed’s Kasilof Seafoods; 54 Degrees North Omega-3 Oil by American Seafoods Company, and three pet treat products — Alaska Naturals Wild Seafood by Trident Seafoods, Wild Catch for Pets Salmon Sticks by Copper River Seafoods and Yummy Chummies by Arctic Paws.Other new seafood entries include: Trident’s Alaska Whitefish Burger, Copper River Seafoods Zesty Grilled Cod Portions, Kodiak’s Pickled Willies with Smoked Black Cod Tips, and several offerings from C&H Classic Smoked Fish and Tilgners Specialized Smoked Seafoods of Ninilchik, last year’s grand prize winner.A notable thing about the annual Symphony is that it includes seafood producers ranging from the very small to the majors.“No matter what size you are or whether you’re trying to get into a niche market or competition on a global basis, winning the Symphony of Seafood really makes you stand out. And it showcases what the industry does all the way to the final product on the plate,” said Julie Decker, executive director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, host of the event.Dates of the competitions and tastings are Feb. 15 in Seattle, Feb. 17 in Juneau and Feb.21 in Anchorage. www.afdf.orgInlet watchersOne good thing that came out of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill was the creation of laws creating citizen councils to oversee oil industry activities and regulators.Since 1990, the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council has promoted environmentally safe transportation and oil facility operations in the region, which includes downstream.The Council has several seats set to expire, including a commercial fishing seat on its board of directors.“Those seats belong to certified aquaculture associations and commercial fishing groups, and the Cities of Kenai, Homer and Kodiak,” said Lynda Giguere, CIRCAC Public Outreach Director.“If something happens upstream, they are definitely in our area of concern,” Giguere said. “Our role is to continue to bring local voices and communities to the table.”Cook Inlet is home to a patchwork of 16 fixed platforms tapping into about 250 oil and gas wells and 1,000 miles of pipelines. Giguere said people are surprised to learn that the citizen’s group does much more than oil spill prevention and response programs.“We have a biological and chemical monitoring program, and we have taken the scientific lead for Alaska on a contaminant study for the Western Gulf including Kodiak,” Giguere said. “We also introduced the Alaska shore zone mapping project, which has since expanded to include the entire state.”Add to that habitat mapping, studying winter prey for beluga whales, and working with the Coast Guard to create an area-wide harbor safety committee.Names for CIRCAC seats are being accepted now.

And the Park Service is requiring that all food vendors at its parks and monuments, etc. can only serve seafood endorsed by those private enterprises.Senator Lisa Murkowski blasted the Park Service for ignoring federal guidelines that state, “the government does not endorse any particular labeling or documentation program over another.”The Park Service also brushed aside the government’s own FishWatch program that has been rating U.S. fisheries for years.Murkowski also criticized Wal-Mart for turning its back on USA salmon and Alaska’s small fishing businesses.Likewise, Governor Sean Parnell sent a letter last week to Wal-Mart CEO Michael Duke expressing “great disappointment,” and saying that while he commends Wal-Mart’s desire to source its products responsibly, he believes the decision was based on “incomplete information.”“I encourage you to recognize that sustainable labeling has grown beyond the days when domination by a single eco-label was a viable option,” Parnell wrote.He added that, while Wal-Mart’s “commitment to source only MSC seafood may have been sensible when first declared back in 2006, that policy is now sorely dated and is serving only to deprive your customers of high quality products produced in America and forcing your company to source salmon from less sustainable fisheries in foreign nations.”Parnell pointed out that the Alaska State Constitution has mandated management of fishery resources on a sustained yield principle; the only U.S. state with such explicit conservation language in its constitution.“No one understands more than Alaskans what it takes to protect fish stocks and their habitat,” Parnell wrote. “Because we have chosen, as a state, to put sustainability above profit, our historic fisheries have thrived famously and the Alaska model serves as an example to other regions.”Big Bay payday  A base price of $1.50/lb for fishermen at the world’s biggest sockeye salmon fishery Bristol Bay, an increase of $.50 higher per pound over the past two years. The final price will be even higher for many fishermen who will get an extra $.15 for chilled fish and another nickel for bled.The price boost comes from a slightly lower catch than expected (15.5 million so far) — and big improvements in fish quality. Last year, for the first time, more than half of the Bristol Bay salmon catch was chilled. That number will climb even higher this summer.Spearheaded by the fishermen funded/operated Regional Seafood Development Association, more Bristol Bay fishermen are routinely using improved handling techniques and the group has partnered with processors to barge ice out to the far flung fishing fleets.“Everyone literally has stepped up; harvesters, processors, marketing, sales transportation, everything has improved in the whole supply chain. It’s taken a lot of hard work from a lot of people,” Glenn Reed, director of the Pacific Seafood Processors Association told KDLG, radio news, during a visit to Dillingham.Sockeye salmon are Alaska’s big money fish and the bulk of the catch comes from Bristol Bay. Last year, for example, sockeyes were worth fully half of the statewide salmon value of $505 million at the docks.The economic benefits of the fishery circulate far beyond Bristol Bay. The salmon also supports thousands of jobs in Pacific Coast states and beyond. According to a University of Alaska report, the Bristol Bay fishery also creates nearly 8,000 jobs nationwide in transportation sectors and all along the distribution chain as it heads to markets in the U.S. and around the world.Seafood feedback Next to catching the fish, the biggest challenge is getting people to buy it. Seafood sales approached $15 billion at American seafood counters last year, a $1.5 billion increase since 2008.  That’s good news for Alaska, which provides nearly 60 percent of the nation’s wild caught seafood and 95 percent of its salmon.According to “Fish and Seafood Trends in the U.S.” by Packaged Facts,  40 percent of consumers regard seafood as  a healthier protein than meats. At the same time, 25 percent said they worry more about spoilage and contamination of fish than beef or poultry.Fifty one percent of customers believe that fresh seafoods are healthier than frozen. (Wrong).   Packaged Facts projects that overall and depending on the rate of the economy, the U.S. retail market for seafood will top $17 billion by 2017, reflecting a three percent annual growth rate.Americans eat most of their seafood at restaurants and the National Restaurant Association predicts it will make an bigger splash this year.   A survey of its 2,000 members revealed the hottest dining trends are locally sourced meats, seafood and produce. Another top trend is using new cuts of meats and sustainable seafoods.A recent survey of 1,100 Americans by the Chicago-based Perishables Group showed that 40 percent said they were not familiar with the sustainable seafood concept -  topmost on their minds was food safety, followed by price.Less than 20 percent said they recalled seeing any  eco-labels or messages in supermarkets or restaurants – yet 62 percent said they recalled messages about wild or farmed seafood.  In terms of organizations that promote sustainability, 46 percent were familiar with the World Wildlife Fund; only five percent were familiar with the Marine Stewardship Council.<COL>Wal-Mart ‘turns its back’ on US salmon<COL>2013-07-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/07/revisiting-the-magnuson-stevens-act/<COL>Revisiting the Magnuson-Stevens ActBy Laine WelchThe rules that govern our nation’s fisheries are being retooled, so it’s reassuring that Congress isn’t traveling in uncharted seas.More than 80 percent of Alaska’s fish landings hail come from federally managed waters, and the Magnuson-(Ted) Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is the primary law ruling U.S. fisheries. The Act is undergoing reauthorization for the first time in seven years.First enacted in 1976, the MSA “Americanized” the fisheries by booting out foreign fleets to beyond 200 miles from our shores. It created the nation’s eight fishery management councils, and its laws dictate everything from fishing and bycatch quotas, to catch shares, observer coverage, habitat protection and more.The MSA legislation is now in the lap of the Senate Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard subcommittee, chaired by Alaska Senator Mark Begich.“It’s the big deal; it really does dictate for generations to come the parameters for managing the fishing industry of this country,” Begich said from his DC office.The sessions are not designed as debates, but to “put things on the table,” he said. “Both the positive and the negative; what’s working and what’s not. So at the end of the day, we can look at it in a broad perspective and determine where and if we need to make modifications.”The main issues he’s heard from Alaskans so far include the lack of mention of subsistence needs in the Act, and the “need for balance” among commercial, sport and subsistence users. Topping them all, is the need to have fishery decisions driven by good science.“We hear over and over again to make sure decisions continue to be driven by science and not just some political decision, or who has the majority on a board or a commission,”  he said.Begich is working with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), the ranking Republican on the Oceans Committee, to schedule listening sessions across the country.“We want to make sure we continue to develop fish policy that is not only good for Alaska, but good for our nation,” he added.Senator Begich expects the MSA to be reauthorized early next year. Send MSA comments to: msacomments@begich.senate.gov.On Frankenfish: Senators Begich and Murkowski and Rep. Young all have come out strongly against the Food and Drug Administration potentially giving a green light to genetically modified Atlantic salmon. The fish, tweaked to grow three times faster than normal, would be the first animal approved for human consumption. No labeling would be required to alert consumers they are purchasing a GMO fish. A ruling by the FDA is expected this fall.“We are working double time to prevent that product from coming to the marketplace,” Begich said. “I met with the White House two weeks ago and expressed concern that the FDA does not know what they are doing.  They are going to introduce a product into the marketplace that could damage this country’s seafood industry,” Begich said, adding that at a minimum, the man-made fish needs to be labeled.“It will be guilt by association. We already are hearing grumblings from major Alaska salmon customers in Canada and Europe. We cannot have this as part of this country’s seafood industry,” Begich fumed.He cited a recent bipartisan victory with a Murkowski-sponsored GMO labeling requirement being added to the Agriculture Bill. The measure squeaked by on a 15-14 vote, with Begich putting it over the top.“We are going to keep skinning this cat any way we can,” Begich said.On Wal-Mart’s salmon diss – The nation’s largest retailer has said it will not sell Alaska seafood if it is not labeled as “sustainably managed” by the London-based Marine Stewardship Council. The MSC spearheaded the sustainable seafood movement in 1997 – showcasing the good management of Alaska’s salmon industry as its first big “certification” success. More recently, the industry has opted out of the MSC program, believing the Alaska brand trumps a high priced eco-logo.“If I ask a consumer, do you want an MSC labeled salmon or wild Alaska salmon, I can guarantee what they will say,” Begich said.He added:  “Name me one other state that has sustainability written into its constitution. We are the role model and the MSC used Alaska as its shining example of sustainable fishery management. We don’t need to pay high logo and licensing fees to an organization in order to prove something that we already know.”Salmon sales through April – Alaska’s salmon is marketed in several forms – such as fresh or frozen, fillets, roe and in cans. The State tracks sales by product, price, production and region and reports on it three times a year.Here’s a snapshot of the January through April 2013 wholesale compared to the same time last year: The bulk of Alaska’s salmon pack goes out frozen, in headed and gutted form. Chinook prices bumped up by 90-cents to nearly $4/lb through April.Frozen cohos averaged $2.54/lb, a 30-cent increase.  Frozen sockeyes slumped below $3/lb, a drop of 31 cents on half the volume. Chum salmon prices dropped from $2 to $1/lb a pound on double the sales volume. Prices for frozen sockeye fillets also fell below $6/lb from January through April, compared to an average $6.25 for the same time last year. Chum fillets dropped by more than a dollar to $3.20 a pound.Sales of canned sockeye and pink salmon showed steady price increases, but hold onto your hats for the price gains for Alaska salmon roe.For pink salmon, average wholesale prices approached $12/lb through April, nearly double last year. Coho roe ticked up from $9.90 to nearly $12 a pound. For chum salmon, the average roe price topped $20/lb, an increase of five dollars from 2012.Fish watch – The statewide salmon catch was nearing 50 million fish out of a 179 million forecast; Bristol Bay’s sockeye catch is likely to total a disappointing 14 million fish after the reds came and went eight days early; Alaska’s first red king crab fishery kicked off last week with a half-million-pound quota; Halibut longliners have taken over half of their 22 million pound catch limit; for sablefish, 60 percent of the 28 million pound quota has been landed; The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute is searching for a new International Program Director.

Ballot Measure 4, sponsored by the group Bristol Bay Forever, asks voters to give the Alaska Legislature final say on any large oil, gas and mining projects in the 36,000 square miles of the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve.The initiative does three significant things to the existing reserve, said Dick Mylius, a former state director for the Division of Mining, Land, and Water.“It adds large-scale metallic mines to things requiring legislative approval, it broadens the geographic area to include the entire drainage including uplands, and it also applies to state, private and federal lands within the reserve,” Mylius said at a recent forum hosted by Alaska Common Ground in Dillingham.The proposed Pebble Mine, he said, would take a direct hit if the ballot measure passes.“Pebble is within the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve, it would be greater than 640 acres, and it is a large scale metallic sulfide mine. So if this (ballot measure) passed, it would require that the legislature approve the Pebble Mine at the end of the permitting process,” Mylius told KDLG.The Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve was created in 1972 as a way to safeguard salmon from oil and gas development. Legislative approval would add another layer of protection, said Anders Gustafson, Director of the Renewable Resources Coalition.“In the end, there’s no one saying, ‘you’ve got this permit to dredge here, you’ve got that permit to build this road,’ but where is the permit that says should we do it at all,” Gustafson said. “I see the ‘could’ permits, but where are the ‘should?’ Is this going to have a bad effect overall, is this the right thing to do in general? There is no end result that evaluates the impacts of all these permits together.”Mining engineer Richard Hughes argued that the Alaska Legislature doesn’t have the authority to regulate permits.“They could have the right to designate a special area, no question about it, “Hughes said, “but I think moving the approval process to the legislature is a separation of powers issue, and a usurpation of the authority of the state administrators.”Regardless, Alaska voters will have their say on protecting salmon at Bristol Bay at the polls on Nov. 4.Crab creeps upAlaska’s biggest crab fisheries in the Bering Sea just got a bit bigger. When the season opens Oct. 15, crabbers at Bristol Bay can drop pots for 10 million pounds of red king crab — a 16-percent increase.Similarly, the snow crab harvest was bumped up 26 percent to 68 million pounds.The biggest Bering Sea crab surprise is the whopping increase for bairdi Tanners, the larger cousin of opilio, or snow crab. Long closures to help rebuild the stock over the past 20 years appear to be paying off: State managers announced a Tanner harvest of 15 million pounds this year — the largest in 20 years — and an increase from just 1.4 million pounds last season.At far away St. Matthew Island, a blue king crab fishery will reopen with a small 655,000 pound catch limit. That fishery has been closed for two years.Closer to shore, the news isn’t so good for Southeast Alaska crabbers. Biologists say the stock of red and blue king crab is at the lowest level in more than two decades and will remain closed. The region has not had a king crab fishery since 2011, after being closed for six years prior.Hats off!Kenai attorney and longtime fisherman Jim Butler headed a list of “Fisherman of the Year” awards at the United Fishermen of Alaska 40th anniversary celebration in Anchorage. Butler was cited for his long advocacy for Alaska fishermen; notably, his work on advisory groups and oil legislation after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.The 2013 award also went to Bruce Schactler of Kodiak, a veteran fisherman and USDA food aid program coordinator for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. Schactler is credited with breaking trail to get Alaska fish into hunger relief and food aid programs around the world.Jim and Rhonda Hubbard of Kruzhof Fisheries in Seward scored the high honor for 2014. The Hubbards were hailed for drawing attention to the complexity of state and federal regulations for seafood sellers, and for their advocacy for “fair and reasonable regulations” for the fishing industry.United Fishermen of Alaska is the nation’s largest commercial fishing group, representing 35 fishing organizations and thousands of fishermen.<COL>Voters asked to give Alaska Legislature final say<COL>2014-10-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/10/fisheries-meeting-gained-from-sullivans-rebuff/<COL>Fisheries meeting gained from Sullivan’s rebuffby Laine WelchI must admit that U.S. Senate candidate Dan Sullivan achieved something I have been trying to accomplish as a fisheries writer for more than a quarter of a century: he gave long legs to media stories about Alaska’s fisheries and, more importantly, attracted unparalleled recognition of the seafood industry nationwide.How did that come about for a fractious industry that bemoans a la comedian Rodney Dangerfield — “I don’t get no respect?”When Sullivan’s campaign announced he would not attend a traditional Kodiak fisheries debate scheduled with all U.S. Senate candidates in late May, he said it was due to a military obligation. Then, after winning the August primary, and despite months of advance notice, Sullivan’s campaign abruptly brushed off a fisheries face-off against incumbent Sen. Mark Begich set for Oct. 1. Dan had no other commitment, his manager said, his travel schedule was just “too busy.”The fish gurry immediately hit the fan. Press releases from opposing factions started flying; newspaper, radio, TV and blog headlines screamed that Sullivan dissed Alaska’s largest work force and simply didn’t give a “crappie.” The story even outran the 24-hour news cycle, staying for weeks and on people’s minds.Enter Senator Lisa Murkowski.Word quickly spread on the fish vine that she advised Dan that a “no-show” was a really bad move, and to reconsider. He did, and Murkowski — who can talk fish with the best of them — schooled him for two weeks in a total immersion kind of way. Senator Lisa even accompanied Sullivan to Kodiak a day before the fisheries debate to make an even bigger splash.It paid off fairly well. Dan held his own against Begich, who is a passionate fisheries whiz, as well as chairman of the U.S. Senate subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and U.S. Coast Guard.It was a first opportunity for Alaskans to hear Dan Sullivan’s ideas and opinions on fishery-related issues. As a result, he fielded most questions from the media panelists, along with hard balls from Begich.No one could pin Dan down on his position on the Pebble Mine. Claiming that he “has never come out in support of the mine,” he resorted to the tiresome talking points  of “not trading one resource for another” and “supporting the process.” Begich has come out strongly against the proposed mine, and echoed the words of the late Ted Stevens that Pebble is “the wrong mine in the wrong place.”Begich pressed Sullivan to answer yes or no on his support of oil and gas exploration leases. Those are set to become available in federal waters off Bristol Bay in 2017, an area dubbed “the nation’s fish basket.”“I’d look at the science and see what the federal agencies are doing to balance resource opportunities in the state. When I see the science and the recommendations, I would make the decisions,” Sullivan responded.“These leases have happened before and we bought them out based on the science,” retorted Begich, who opposes the idea.When asked by Begich if he acknowledges climate change, Sullivan said, “Yes, but as for the causes, the science is still out. I would not be for a one-size-fits-all solution. We’ve got to get the science right before we take some big action that will further limit or hurt our fisheries.”The Kodiak fisheries debate — which is always broadcast statewide, was also covered by Japan Broadcasting Corp., C-Span, National Public Radio, Associated Press, KTUU, KTVA and Alaska Dispatch News.House raucousFollowing U.S. Senate candidates Begich and Sullivan to the fish debate stage were Alaska Congressman Don Young and Democratic challenger Forrest Dunbar. It was the first time the two candidates had met face to face, and Dunbar was clearly prepared to take on the 42-year House of Representatives veteran.Young set an argumentative tone by quibbling over debate protocols, referring to 30-year-old Dunbar as “naïve” and “immature,” and often glaring at and interrupting moderator John Whiddon, a decorated retired USCG helicopter pilot who has pulled off some of the hairiest rescues on record in the Bering Sea. (He didn’t bat an eye.)The audience gasped when Young glibly announced that he had not bothered to prepare any questions for Dunbar as part of the debate format. But it did not take him long to get serious once he realized how well-prepared, knowledgeable and articulate his opponent is on Alaska’s fisheries.Young and Dunbar agreed on many issues, such as the need to make sure fishing futures exist for young Alaskans, and the need to reduce Chinook and halibut bycatch by trawlers.“The Gulf is where most of the problem lies, not the Bering Sea,” Young pointed out. “It can be done with excluder panels and modern technology. If they don’t clean up and do it better, someone else will do it for them.”Likewise, they saw mostly eye-to-eye on: the need for better seafood labeling, stopping fishing pirates on the high seas, opposing genetically modified fish and offshore fish farming, home-porting more vessels in Alaska and increasing resident and corporate involvement, and that ocean “assification” (Young’s term) is a threat to Alaska’s fisheries.Dunbar is strongly opposed to the Pebble Mine, whereas Young said: “It is the state’s land and it has control over the resources. Let the state do its job.”No one can discount Don Young’s knowledge and caring for Alaska’s seafood industry. He helped write and pass laws in the 1970s that “Americanized” our nation’s fisheries, by booting foreign fleets to beyond 200 miles from U.S. shores. He also is credited with pushing through an international ban on the use of miles of driftnets on the high seas.But his condescension of Dunbar did not reflect well on Alaska’s lone Congressman.“Why do you think in your young years that you can better represent Alaska,” Young asked his competitor. Dunbar, who is from Eagle and Cordova and has a Yale law degree, responded that he was an intern in DC for Frank Murkowski and another legislator.“I have more experience than you did when you went to DC. And I grew up in this state and represent Alaska values,” Dunbar said.“Sounds good, looks good, but it doesn’t quite pass the smell test,” Young retorted. “You are a very ambitious young man, but you don’t know the ropes. What I have done is represent and fight for all Alaskans every day.”When Dunbar questioned Young about past ethics violations and referred to his “lack of clout” in Congress, Young upraided him saying: “Right now you are a young man all fired up and wanting to make an impression. Attacking a Congressman for 42 years is wrong and demeans the office. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”Fish watchMany Alaskans are surprised to learn that salmon fishing goes on in Southeast Alaska almost year-round. Trollers there are heading back out for winter king salmon on Oct. 11 in a season that can run all the way through April.Southeast’s pot shrimp season opened Oct. 1 with a regionwide harvest of about half a million pounds. Crabbers also began dropping pots that day for the fall Dungeness fishery. The total Dungie catch this year could top 6 million pounds. Dive fisheries for sea cucumber and urchins also got underway Oct. 1 first in Southeast and Kodiak.A little over 1 million pounds remain for Alaska’s halibut fleet out of a nearly 15-million-pound catch limit. Prices at major ports remained in the high $6 and over $7 range for fishermen. Weekly landings have been less than 500,000 pounds over the past month.   Sablefish prices also are through the ceiling, topping $4.25 for under three pounders and $7.55 for seven ups.The Alaska pollock fishery wrapped up nearly a month early in the Bering Sea. At nearly three billion pounds, that’s a lot of fish sticks!   Fleets are also targeting cod, flatfish, and many other types of groundfish.In the Central and Western Gulf, trawl, hook and line, pot boats and jig bots are targeting P-cod. Gulf trawlers also are back out on the water for the final pollock fishery of the year.The Aleutian Islands golden king crab fleet is tapping away at its 6 million pound quota. Catches for Bristol Bay red king crab and Bering Sea snow crab should be out any day.<COL>Fisheries meeting gained from Sullivan’s rebuff<COL>2014-10-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/06/crab-fisheries-open-mid-june/<COL>Crab fisheries open mid JuneAmid the salmon fisheries starting up all across the state, several Alaska crab seasons also get underway each summer.  In mid June, the summer Dungeness crab fishery opens in the panhandle, as does red king crab at Norton Sound. Those are followed in August by golden kings along the far flung Aleutian Islands, which might soon take the title as Alaska’s largest king crab fishery.Unlike other Bering Sea crab stocks, surveys on golden kings have been limited due to distance and high costs. The deep water stocks have sustained a fishery for 30 years, but managers aren’t sure about what’s really going on down there.The golden crab catch has been limited with a conservative six million pound cap, and crabbers have long believed that the harvest could be higher – but the lack of research left too many questions about the overall abundance of the resource. Until now. An experiment by the crab fleet and researchers has revealed that golden king crab stocks around the Aleutian Islands are not only stable, they are thriving.“The fleet has over the years changed the pot mesh size to allow little crabs to escape. That’s great fishing practice, but unfortunately, it is not great scientific information. Managers have been concerned as to whether there is any recruitment of small golden crab into the population,” said Denby Lloyd, science advisor for the Aleutian King Crab Research Foundation, formed by the harvesting vessels.In the experiment, pots with small mesh designed to not let the little ones go, were put down next to strings of regular gear during the commercial fishery. (Golden king crab pots are strung together with long lines to prevent them from getting lost in the region’s massive underwater mountain ranges.)  The results were very clear, Lloyd said.“The regular pots caught good numbers of legal sized crab but not many sub legals. But the paired research pots right next to them caught as many or more legal crab and very large numbers of smaller crab,” he said.Research will be ongoing and fishery managers will use the data in stock assessment modeling.  The end result could be a new king of the crab hill.“With this level of productivity,” Lloyd said, “potentially those quotas will increase for golden king crab. We might be in competition with Bristol Bay for Alaska’s largest king crab harvest.”The Aleutian Island crab fleet also is helping with ocean acidification and handling studies. Lloyd had high praise for the collaboration: “Having the industry be this enthusiastic and having the agencies open up to immediate cooperative research opportunities like this, it’s really fun stuff.”Steller upticks – There is “strong evidence” that the numbers for both western and eastern populations of Alaska’s Steller sea lions appear to be, by and large, on an upward trajectory.  That’s according to a May 15 technical memorandum by researchers at the (Seattle-based) Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which summarizes results of air and ship-based sea lion surveys from 2000 to 2012.The upticks are good news. Since the late 1990s many Alaska fisheries have been restricted in regions where numbers of sea lions have been dwindling for decades, notably, in Central Gulf and areas further west.The AFSC memo said that while the western Aleutian stocks still appear uncertain, numbers increased in the eastern and western Gulf of Alaska, and the eastern Aleutians.  If those counts continue to tick up through 2015, some Steller stocks could be on track toward a down listing from ‘endangered’ to ‘threatened’ status under the Endangered Species Act.Conversely, in Southeast Alaska sea lion numbers remain on an increase, a trend since the 1970s. The surveys showed at least 1,600 sea lions moving from the central gulf to southeast during breeding season, the memo said.  www.afsc.noaa.govFrankenbreed – Studies from Canada show that genetically modified salmon can cross breed with a close relative: brown trout, and produce an even faster growing hybrid.  Researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland said the study highlights the ecological consequences should so called Frankenfish get into the wild.Ronald Stotish of Aqua Bounty, the Massachusetts and Panama-based company creating the GMO salmon, insists the risk of it breeding in the wild is ‘negligible.’The application calls for  land-based, contained cultivation of all sterile female populations  that will be reared only in FDA inspected facilities,” he said.The Food and Drug Administration will announce in a few months if it approves GMO salmon for human consumption. Congress is still debating whether the GMO fish will be labeled to alert American consumers.Speaking of labels – should the government have a role in certifying sustainable seafood?  The Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, an advisor to the Secretary of Commerce, wants feedback “on the benefits and limitations of third party seafood certifications and the potential for a federal government role.” Having a fishery certified as being well managed for sustainability has become a necessary part of global seafood commerce.  Find a link to the MAFAC survey at   www.surveymonkey.com/s/TZZHNZB.

A strong U.S. dollar against the Yen, Euro and other currencies also makes it more expensive for foreign customers to buy Alaska salmon. At the same time, record numbers of cheaper, farmed salmon continue to flood into the U.S. from Norway and Chile.Combined, those factors are having a downward press on permit prices – notably, at Alaska’s bellwether sockeye fishery at Bristol Bay.Drift permits last fall were fetching a record $175,000; now they’ve dipped to $164,000.“Permit prices have softened in the Bay and kind of across the board for any salmon permits,” said Doug Bowen with Alaska Boats and Permits in Homer. He added that there “is concern about the price in the Bay this year.”“A lot of sockeye is left in the market from the big run in the Bay last year, plus from the Fraser River. And another big sockeye run is forecast for Bristol Bay this summer. So there are some negative price rumors out there about the exvessel (dock) price in the Bay dipping below a dollar a pound.”Even if a permit buyer is interested, both brokers said it could be tough going for anyone trying to break into the fishery.“Some of these guys buying in are having quite a bit of difficulty just lining up a market and finding anyone who will take them on, because the processors at Bristol Bay are bracing for another big year and not really looking to expand their fleets,” Bowen explained.Elsewhere, Prince William Sound seine permits have dropped below $200,000 for the first time in several years. Cook Inlet drifts are $65,000, down from $90,000 two years ago. Kodiak seine permits are flat around $50,000.Still, both brokers said the mood on the Alaska waterfront is very upbeat.“I could feel it in the fall with how busy we were,” Olsen said. “People are looking forward to a good year.”“We do see a lot of optimism among the fleets,” Bowen said, “and people are building new boats. That is definitely the biggest vote of confidence you can make.”Praise seafood!The 40-day Lenten season began early this year, giving a traditional boost to seafood sales. Lent is a time of fasting and soul-searching for millions of Christians around the world. It dates back to the fourth century, and many believers give up favorite foods, or devote time to volunteering or charity work.What the peak holiday selling season from Thanksgiving to Christmas means to retailers, Lent means to the seafood industry. Food Services of America, for example, reports that Ash Wednesday is the busiest day of the year for frozen seafood sales, and the six weeks following is the top selling season for the entire year. Restaurant trades say weekly sales of seafood increase 25 to 40 percent during Lent.While nearly all seafood enjoys a surge of interest during Lent, the most traditional items served are “whitefish” species, such as cod, pollock, flounder and halibut.But no matter what the seafood favorite, the six-week Lenten season is good news for Alaska, which provides more than 60 percent of America’s wild-caught seafood to our nation’s restaurants and grocery stores.Crabby clothesStylish work out gear made from crab and shrimp shells is drawing raves from exercise enthusiasts in Vancouver, British Columbia.“The clothes are breathable, durable and fast-drying,” said Quincy Samycia, co-founder of Strongbody Apparel. “Everything we use is non-toxic so they are environmentally friendly as well.”The fashion-forward line is designed for the gym, and its uniqueness comes from its “odor crush” technology.“The magic ingredient comes from the ocean – it’s a natural biopolymer in crab and shrimp shells called chitosan,” explained Megan Conyers. “When it is combined with the fabric, it inhibits the growth of bacteria on the clothing and that is what makes it odor-free.”Samycia and Conyers spent years researching fabrics and making designs to fit their active lifestyle before launching the apparel last year. (Google chitin-based fabric producers.)Between 500-700 crab and shrimp shells are used to make a few ounces of solution that is then combined with the fabric. Because chitosan’s structure is similar to cellulose, it blends easily with cotton and other fabrics.“One thing that definitely drew us to this particular solution is that it is environmentally friendly and a by-product of the fishing industry,” Conyers said. “All that stuff is just going to go to waste, so why not find a use for it?”Estimates claim that nearly 25 billion tons of chitin from seafood is dumped each year.Along with being odorless, the chitosan-infused fabric also is super durable – and it is safe for those who may be allergic to shellfish.The Strongbody line includes workout shorts and leggings, tanks and sports bras, and Quincy’s favorite — the pulse elite tee. He agreed that it’s the chitin technology that has made their clothes stand out in the market of fitness gear.“People like different. Nobody just wants to go out and get just another T-shirt,” he said. “There is a strong market for what we are doing; people are definitely looking to have a unique piece of clothing and they want a story to tell.”  Visitwww.strongbodyapparel.com<COL>Fishing mood ‘upbeat’ despite drop in salmon permit prices<COL>2015-02-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/10/graying-crab-fleet-needs-to-recruit-younger-sea-crabbers/<COL>‘Graying’ crab fleet needs to recruit younger sea crabbersby Laine WelchThe Bering Sea crab fleet now stands at 77 vessels; a far cry from the nearly 250 boats before the fishery downsized to catch shares in 2005. Fewer boats mean less hands on deck, and as with many others, the Bering Sea crabbers are “graying” and need to recruit young entrants to sustain the iconic fisheries. To do so, shareholders have devised a way to give captains and crews first crack at available crab.“The long-term future of the fishery is dependent on bringing young people in. That’s not unique to crab, we are seeing it all over Alaska and fisheries in the US.,” said Mark Gleason, executive director of harvester group Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers. “There just isn’t that pipeline of young people coming up through the ranks, and a ‘Right of First Offer’ program is one of the ways we hope to change that.”It has long been a goal of fishery managers to make sure active participants have access to crab quota shares. Gleason said in numerous workshops in recent years, ABSC got feedback from captains and crewmembers on road blocks to buying in, such as not knowing when quota was up for grabs and the need for smaller portions to buy. That helped shape the ROFO program.“Basically, it carves out a minimum 10 percent of a (catch share) transaction, and is then offered on a Right of First Offer basis to active participants,” Gleason said.He called it a more affordable way to get ownership in crab fisheries, without needing to buy or build a big boat.“With quota-based management and the opportunity to buy smaller chunks of quota, a guy can get in with relatively little amount of money,” he said. “He can buy quota, bring that to the boat he’s fishing on, and use it to build his assets over time.”All crab transactions are handled by permit brokers, such as Dock Street in Seattle, regarded as the “go-to” place for crab shares. Specialist Jeff Osborn admits availability is sketchy, and shares of red king crab are very rare. Dock Street currently has one listing for 120,000 pounds of snow crab at $20 per, and four listings of bairdi Tanners at $18-$20 per share. Shares of red king crab are reportedly valued in the $35 range.Bering Sea crabbers can register to be notified when quota becomes available at www.crabqs.com.Seafood bash gets biggerAlaska’s biggest seafood bash is expanding to include more new products and a third venue. Added to the traditional mix of retail, food service and smoked entries at the 22nd-annual Alaska Symphony of Seafood, judges and fish fans will taste and rate items in a new byproducts category called “Beyond the Plate.”“The definition of this category is a consumer-ready product made with parts of seafood which would typically be deemed fish waste or a by-product of the primary processing,” said Julie Decker, Executive Director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, which hosts the Symphony.All new products will be judged in February by a panel of experts in Seattle. That’s followed by a seafood soiree in Anchorage, where all the winners are announced. Then, it’s off to a new venue – Juneau – for a third seafood celebration. The event is topped off for the winners with a trip and booth space at the International Boston Seafood Show in mid-March.The Symphony of Seafood dates in February and the” call for products” will be out by the end of October. Entry forms are due by Dec. 31. For more info, check outwww.afdf.org/symphony-of-seafood/Diving for dollarsEvery October, divers head to the depths for sea cucumbers, giant geoduck clams and sea urchins. Most action occurs in Southeast Alaska, where 70 divers search the bottom for booty. For cukes, the harvest guideline is just over 1 million pounds; that’s an increase of 8.5 percent from last year. For geoducks, the 750,000 harvest is decreased 12-percent.Kodiak is the only other region where dive fisheries for sea cucumbers and urchins occur, although on a much smaller scale. This year, the harvest for 20 divers is set at 140,000 pounds for cukes, which could fetch $5 a pound. No divers have signed on for more than 15 years for Kodiak’s green sea urchin fishery, which typically paid at over $1 a pound.Fish WatchAlaska’s largest herring fishery at Togiak in Bristol Bay will be even bigger next year. State managers are expecting a harvest of 29,012 tons next spring; an increase of nearly 4,000 tons over the 2014 fishery. The grounds price was a dismal $50/ton. That could increase if processors add canning lines to their operations, instead of using only the herring roe.Salmon fishermen at Upper Cook Inlet caught fewer fish, but scored higher prices. The catch of 3.2 million sockeye salmon was 20 percent below the 10-year average, but the value of the fishery at $35 million was the ninth best since 1960. Sockeye salmon represents more than 90 percent of the value of the Upper Inlet fishery.<COL>‘Graying’ crab fleet needs to recruit younger sea crabbers<COL>2014-10-21<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/08/people-magazine-calls-farmed-fish-better-choice/<COL>People Magazine calls farmed fish ‘better choice’By Laine WelchAlaska salmon continue to get broadsided by ill-informed, far-away big wigs who believe they are best suited to make seafood choices for their customers.Sodexo, one of the world’s largest food service contractors, said last week that its policy is to only serve seafood certified by (you guessed it) the London-based Marine Stewardship Council. In this case, the fish is targeted to the U.S. troops. Sodexo, a Fortune 500 company home-based in France, has an eight-year contract to provide food services to U.S. military mess halls, including $22 million of seafood each year.It’s very likely that many other Americans also are not benefitting from Alaska seafood, as Sodexo provides foods to hundreds of federal, state and private hospitals, schools, prisons, assisted living centers and other facilities across the country.In a letter to Sodexo USA CEO George Chavel, Senator Mark Begich called the salmon snub, “outrageous” and an “appalling insult.”“This company has decided that, because of some labeling issue, they don’t think Alaska fish products meet their standards,” Begich fumed during a phone call as he was leaving a fisheries hearing in Kenai. “We believe the certification we have through Global Trust, the same that Canada and Iceland receive on their fish products, is as high a standard, if not higher, than what Sodexo wants.”The MSC spearheaded the sustainable seafood movement in 1997, showcasing Alaska’s salmon fishery as its first big certification success.  The Alaska salmon industry opted out of the MSC program last year, due to growing logo and licensing costs and concerns over inconsistent standards.Sodexo follows Wal-Mart and the U.S. Park Service in the fish fight of opting to exclude Alaska salmon based on an eco-label. Both were quick to claim “salmon love,” but admitted they do not have a clear understanding of Alaska’s new third-party certification standards.“What we are really asking is for ASMI, and others who are closely involved in the industry, to educate us and give us more information,” said Chris Schraeder, Wal-Mart’s Senior Manager of Sustainability Communications. Members of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute and other industry stakeholders are scheduled to meet with Wal-Mart at its Arkansas headquarters next month.Similarly, Senator Begich said on Friday that Sodexo USA called him to say they want to work with Alaska and resolve the seafood spat.“They understand now that there are issues they were unaware of about Alaska’s sustainability programs, and how we track our products. We are happy to educate them,” Begich said.He added: “In a backhanded way, all of this lets us tout the benefits of Alaska fish and make something positive out of an adverse situation. I feel it is my responsibility to promote seafood for Alaska and all U.S. Fisheries, and this gives me a chance to contact these companies directly.”As chairman of the committee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, Senator Begich said he is ready to add eco-labeling clarifications to the Magnuson-Stevens Act as it undergoes reauthorization.“People” put downPeople Magazine is next up to receive an irate letter from Senator Begich and other Alaskans for its recommendation that farmed fish is “a better choice” than wild-caught fish.In his blog this week titled, “The best fish to buy,” fitness and health food guru Harley Pasternak wrote that the many benefits of farmed seafood include, “a reduced likelihood of contamination from mercury and PCBs,” which “are not as much of a risk in a controlled, farmed environment.”It is gratifying to see that readers gave the guru’s fish recommendations big thumbs down. Nearly all of the 60 comments bashed Pasternak: “a hit job on our fisheries;” “a shill for the farm fish industry;” “think he’d eat it with a 10-foot pole;” “Real fish don’t eat pellets;” “farm-raised is genetically modified food;” and chastised him for a poorly researched article that will likely scare people away from eating more seafood.  People ranks in the top 10 of America’s most popular magazines with a circulation of 3.5 million.Who fishes whereMany people are surprised to learn that 80 percent of Alaska’s seafood landings come from federal waters; meaning from three to 200 miles offshore. Oversight falls to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and their staff has compiled a booklet profiling the fishing fleets through 2010. That includes an addendum for 2011 with names of every boat.Some highlights for 2011: 81 trawl boats and 16 catcher-processors fish in the Bering Sea; 98 trawlers fish in the Central and Western Gulf. There are 67 groundfish longline vessels, 137 pot boats and 118 vessels in the jig fleet.Seventy seven boats make up the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands crab fleet, four scallopers and 1,457 boats fish for halibut and sablefish.While most people imagine huge vessels in the federal water fisheries, 80 percent are less than 60 feet. By far, most of the boats were built in the 1970s and 80s.Most of the catch in 2010 – 54 percent – was Alaska pollock, followed by flatfishes at 18 percent and cod at 15 percent. Halibut and sablefish were just one percent of the total catch; shellfish were 2 percent.As to where the fleets call home, most of the large, at-sea catcher processors report Seattle as their homeport, while most of the catcher boats that deliver to shore plants hail from Alaska.Major ports for groundfish include Kodiak, Homer and Sand Point. For halibut and sablefish, top homeports are Homer, Kodiak, Juneau, Petersburg and Sitka.

By Aug. 23, the total harvest topped 241 million (the old record was 222 million in 2005), pushed by huge surges of humpies.The total pink salmon catch was 192 million; the old record was 161 million in 2005. At Prince William Sound, the pink harvest was more than 87 million fish; at Southeast, the pink catch was approaching 73 million; and at Kodiak, the pink catch topped 23 million.Other statewide salmon totals were: Chinook – 303,000; Chum – 17 million; Coho – 3 million; Sockeye – 29 million.<COL>People Magazine calls farmed fish ‘better choice’<COL>2013-08-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/08/alaska-educates-wal-mart-park-service-after-salmon-snub/<COL>Alaska educates Wal-Mart, Park Service after salmon snubBy Laine WelchOncorhynchus! Any doubts about the brand power of Alaska salmon can be put to rest after the high visibility contretemps over the past few weeks – and the fish story has a happy ending.All of Alaska’s “powers that be” converged on Wal-Mart and the National Park Service when both reportedly snubbed Alaska salmon over a labeling issue.  Both Governor Sean Parnell and Senator Mark Begich sent letters to Wal-Mart, blasting the ill-advised decision. Senator Lisa Murkowski verbally (and very publicly) spanked the NPS for not following its own rules.The dust-up stemmed from Alaska’s decision to opt out of a pricey eco-label by the Marine Stewardship Council that, since 2006, Wal-Mart has used to guide its purchases of seafood from sustainably managed fisheries. The process is complex and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to an industry or trade group – but a green label has become part of doing seafood business around the globe.The London-based MSC spearheaded the sustainable seafood movement in 1997 and can take credit for setting the standards followed by other groups in the fisheries certifying business. Ironically, Alaska salmon was the MSC’s first”‘poster fish,” but the State/industry is in the process of transitioning to another fisheries certifier called Global Trust.A routine letter sent to its seafood suppliers whipped things up at Wal-Mart, said Chris Schraeder, Senior Manager of Sustainability Communications.“The letter contained a footnote saying that at this point, Alaska salmon did not have an equivalent certification. People interpreted that to mean that Wal-Mart would no longer be purchasing Alaska salmon,” Schraeder said in a phone call from Wal-Mart’s Arkansas headquarters.It is the first time Wal-Mart has found itself in this type of eco-incident, he added, saying that the company  commissioned two studies earlier this year to review the standards of other certifiers to make sure the company can deliver on its earth-friendly fishing commitment. “What we are really asking is for ASMI, and others who are closely involved in the industry, to educate us and give us information so we can make a sound assessment,” Schraeder said.“We are proud to offer Alaska salmon in our stores,” said Andrea Thomas, senior vice president of sustainability. “It is important to us because we know it is important to our customers.”Wal-Mart last week invited Alaska to send a team to its headquarters “to educate senior executives and buyers about Alaska’s sustainable fisheries and management practices,” Gov. Parnell said in a press release.Meanwhile, Sen. Murkowski followed up with U.S. Dept. of Interior /NPS officials to make sure Alaska salmon can be on the menus at food outlets at nearly 130 parks and monuments nationwide.The senator grilled NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis last week before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and he conceded:  “What I am willing to do is change the guidelines so it includes Alaska wild-caught fish. I think that’s the simple fix here.”After a meeting with Jarvis on Friday, Murkowski  said she believes the perspective of NPS officials has been broadened, “not just for Alaska, but for all U.S. fisheries.”“We’ve turned heads in the right direction,” Murkowski said in a quick phone call as she headed back to Alaska from D.C. for the August break.Salmon sales 2012A snapshot of salmon sales through 2012 shows some good signs for sockeyes. The Alaska Salmon Price Report by the Dept. of Revenue/Tax Division shows market prices for salmon by species, region and product. Here’s a snapshot of 2012 wholesale prices, along with some telling comparisons.The bulk of Alaska’s salmon pack goes to markets frozen whole, headed and gutted. Those values for sockeye salmon continued to slide last year, averaging $2.89 a pound, compared to $3.20 in 2011.That trend already has turned around this year, however. The average price for frozen sockeye salmon ticked up a dime from January through April. Canned reds jumped to $193 per case of talls, a $23 increase from the previous year. Lower supplies and strong demand should keep an upward press on sockeye sales prices throughout the year.Frozen pink salmon prices took a dip last year, averaging $1.29 a pound; down from $1.44.Pink salmon roe prices averaged $10.29 a pound in 2012, an increase of $2.63/lb. That brought the total  value  to more than $100 million. Pink salmon roe prices from January through April 2013 topped $12 a pound.Chums followed a similar pattern: Frozen chums averaged $1.38 a pound, a drop of 44 cents from 2011. But chum roe rang in at nearly $17/lb, for a total value of $120 million. And prices of chum salmon roe through  April topped $20 per pound.Happy Birthday USCG!Aug. 4 marked the 223rd birthday of our nation’s oldest sea-going service – the U.S. Coast Guard.The USCG was launched in 1790 as the U.S. Lighthouse Service when the first Congress gave orders to build 10 vessels to enforce tariff and trade laws, and to prevent smuggling. At the time, that was the only source of revenue for the federal government. The Coast Guard was called the Revenue Cutter Service until 1915 when it was merged with the Life-Saving Service and received its present name from Congress.Back then, historians say rescuers would use a small cannon to fire a sort of giant clothesline toward the masts of stranded ships. Attached to the line was a bulky pair of canvas pants, which sailors would climb into and be hauled ashore.In the Coast Guard’s Top 10 list of most memorable missions, the response to Hurricane Katrina ranks as No. 1. The Coast Guard is credited with saving more than 33,000 people after it took charge there.Two Alaska events made the list: the rescue of 520 people after a fire broke out and sank the cruise ship Prinsendam 130 miles off Ketchikan in 1980. (Maggie Wall of Kodiak took the distress call via Morse Code.)In 1897, six Coast Guardsmen set off from a Cutter near Point Barrow to save the crews of eight whaling ships trapped in the ice. Using dog sleds, they brought 400 reindeer to the whalers in a 1,500 mile journey that took more than two months.The single largest rescue effort in Coast Guard history was in 1937, when a flood on the Mississippi River led to the rescue of 44,000 people — and more than 100,000 head of livestock.Today, roughly 40,000 men and women serve in the U.S. Coast Guard. They are credited with saving more than one million lives — and counting.<COL>Alaska educates Wal-Mart, Park Service after salmon snub<COL>2013-08-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/07/use-grasshoppers-to-grow-fish/<COL>Use grasshoppers to grow fishBy Laine WelchAlaska spends more than $20 million on fish feed each year for its 35 salmon hatcheries — feed that comes primarily from anchovies caught in South America. Meanwhile, Alaska seafood processing companies produce more than 200,000 tons of fishmeal each year — for customers in Asia.Last year, 33 million fish — 20 percent of the total Alaska salmon harvest — originated in hatcheries; in some years, the figure has topped 30 percent. At Prince William Sound, for example, 73 percent of the salmon catch originated in local hatcheries.The most costly part of any hatchery or farmed fish business is the feed. It represents 60 to 70 percent of production costs. The bulk of the feed is made from ground-up wild fish, such as anchovies, herring or menhaden. That market totaled 870 million tons in 2011, valued at $350 billion.According to Chilean fish feed company Camanchaca, fishmeal prices are set to increase 18 percent this year to  $1,750 per ton this year.Roughly 10 per cent of global fish catches go to fishmeal, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.  It takes up to four pounds of wild fish meal to grow one pound of farmed salmon, and the industry is facing increasing criticism to find other food sources.  To the rescue in the search for alternative and sustainable proteins come  —- insects!Tests are showing that all kinds of insects can be an attractive option in the global search for alternative and sustainable proteins. The FAO’s Animal Feed Resources Information System, called Feedipedia, claims that the high crude fat content in black soldier flies provide “high-value feedstuff” for both fish and livestock. Silkworms, maggots, mealworms and termites all provide meal nutrients of varying types and degrees.Topping the list for best insect-based fish feed is grasshoppers or locusts (acridids) of any kind. Feeding trials on certain fish species showed that diets in which 25 and 50 per cent of fishmeal was replaced with grasshopper meal produced results as good as the control diet comprising 100 per cent fishmeal. All growth parameters measured for the selected fish were higher for the feed containing grasshopper meal than for those fed with conventional feeds.  The possibility of recovering chitin from the insects used for fish feed is also being explored.Find the Insects as Animal Feed report at www.thefishsite.comhttp://www.thefishsite.com/articles/1683/insects-as-animal-feedsDippin’ in the YukonThe first-ever commercial salmon dip net fishery on the Lower Yukon River is a resounding success. Seafood.com reports that landings by about 90 fishermen are approaching 40,000 chums so far.The use of dip nets is a new regulation passed by the state Board of Fisheries in January as a way  to allow a chum fishery, while protecting the Yukon’s dwindling numbers of king salmon. Over the past several years, the chum fishery has been held up due to Chinook conservation needs. The dip nets allow for the safe return of king salmon into the river; not a single king salmon has been harmed so far.The Yukon chum run is extremely strong this summer and could top three million fish. The dip net fishermen are earning about $5,000 per week in the new fishery.Salmon watchSockeye salmon are surging into rivers at Bristol Bay, where catches had topped five million fish; more than one million were taken in a single day. The Bay total is projected to be about 17 million reds.  Statewide, the total salmon catch/all species was approaching 13.5 million fish.Salmon competitionFresh salmon prices are up 47 percent from a year ago and imports from Chile are at record levels, according to Urner Barry, the nation’s oldest market watchers since the late 1800s. Imports to the U.S. have approached 80 million pounds of fresh Atlantic salmon fillets,  an increase of roughly 21 percent and an all-time record for U.S. salmon imports.Overall, the U.S. salmon market has expanded significantly, with strong demand and prices, although retail prices tend to drop off a bit at this time of year.Antacids save shellfishThe nation’s largest shellfish producer is dropping the equivalent of Tums and other antacids into its tanks to help oyster larvae build their shells. The environmental news site Grist reports that Washington-based Taylor Shellfish Company believes adding the sodium carbonates will help the oysters and other bivalves battle the corrosion caused by increased acidity in the ocean.Marine ecologist George Waldbusser admitted it’s a less-than-perfect solution, saying: “At some point, they have to be able to address the bigger global CO2 problem.”<COL>Use grasshoppers to grow fish<COL>2013-07-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/11/state-forecasts-banner-year-for-2015-alaska-fisheries/<COL>State forecasts banner year for 2015 Alaska fisheriesby Laine WelchAlaska is poised for some big fish stories next year, based on predictions trickling in from state and federal managers.For the state (and nation’s) largest fishery — Alaska pollock — the Eastern Bering Sea stock has more than doubled its 10-year average to top nine million tons, or 20 billion pounds.And the stock is healthy and growing, according to annual surveys.“It is one of the most stunning fisheries management successes on the planet,” said global market expert John Sackton about pollock numbers released by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. He said Alaska pollock represents 40 percent of global whitefish production.Out of the nine-million-ton pollock biomass, a catch of 1.3 million tons is being recommended for next year; about three billion pounds. Federal managers will set all groundfish harvests in early December.The state is also projecting an “excellent” catch of 58 million pink salmon next year in Southeast Alaska. That would be well above the 10-year average of 41 million, and would rank among the top 10 harvests since 1960.From pink to redThe world’s premier sockeye salmon fishery at Bristol Bay can expect the largest red run in two decades in 2015. Fish and Game predicts a run of 54 million reds and a harvest of 38 million fish — 10 million more than this year.The 2014 run was 53 percent higher than expected, and fish forecasts always are variable and tough to peg, said Tim Sands, area manager at Dillingham. But, he added that all the data points to another big run.“Everybody seems pretty optimistic about the return next year,” he told KDLG. “Everybody’s looking at the data in different ways, and they’re all coming up with numbers around 50 million. I think that shows the run is healthy and sustainable.”The state’s largest herring fishery at Togiak is expecting another huge haul next spring of 29,012 tons in the sac roe fishery; 4,000 tons more than this year.Red king crab wrapIt took crabbers just four weeks to haul up the 9 million pound red king crab quota in this year’s Bristol Bay fishery. The season opened Oct. 15 and fish managers posted the catch at 100 percent as of Nov. 17.The fishery was, for the most part, uneventful, and the fleet was able to dodge some gnarly weather. The biggest crab concern came from an unexpected source, said Heather Fitch, regional manager at Dutch Harbor.“We did have a scare with a lot of barnacles in the beginning of the season and a lot of sorting through the crab at sea,” she said. “But the fishermen moved off those right away and that scare went away.”She called the numbers of heavily barnacled red king crab unusual.It’s likely nothing to worry about, said Bob Foy, director of the NOAA “crab lab” at Kodiak. He added that more of the crusty crabs have been showing up in annual surveys for the past two years.“There is probably just a higher proportion of older shell crab,” Foy explained. “These are crab that are probably not molting every year and the fleet just happened to be working an area where they were aggregated.”Crabs with barnacle-encrusted shells fetch a lower price, because they are less appealing to customers. They also force more sorting and handling on deck, which crabbers try to minimize to prevent damage.A fleet of 63 boats fished for red king crab this is year, which has been the standard for several years. They averaged 28 crab per pot, which Fitch called “pretty decent.”Already half the boats have switched to Tanner crab. That Bering Sea fishery took everyone by surprise when the catch was boosted to 15 million pounds, up from 1.5 million last season.“Normally, when red king crab is over, a few boats switch over,” Fitch said. “This year, we’ve got 33 vessels that already switched over to the Eastern Bering Sea Tanner crab. That’s quite a few more boats than we’ve seen in the last number of years.”Oceans amok!Making sure Alaska’s crab and other stocks remain healthy is the focus of an upcoming Ocean Acidification in Alaska workshop in Anchorage.The informal, open event has attracted a who’s who of OA experts to share what is known today about the ocean’s changing chemistry and how it is corroding Alaska’s marine creatures.In 2011 the state funded $2.7 million over three years to jump start an OA monitoring program in Alaska, and create an OA center at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks. The money also was used to fund monitoring systems and deploy them at four moorings in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea.What is known is that the effects of increasingly acidic oceans — which prevent creatures from growing skeletons and shells — are already visible. And it is happening faster in colder waters than anyone thought possible.“Alaskans are used to lots of variability in fisheries, but you talk about ocean acidification and it terrifies people because it is such a big unknown as to what kinds of impacts it is going to have,” said Molly McCammon, executive director of the Alaska Ocean Observing System and host of the workshop. “We want to highlight what we know today, and talk about how we prepare to adapt or mitigate it.”State funding for Alaska’s OA program is set to expire next June, McCammon said, and national funding has been stalemated at about $6 million a year “with most being spent in other regions of the country.”“We’ll be looking at how we can keep the state program going, where are the gaps in the program, how can we get additional funding and partners, and how we can keep this issue at the forefront of the public and legislators’ minds,” McCammon said.The Ocean Acidification in Alaska workshop is set for Dec. 2-3 at the Anchorage Marriott. Satellite listening stations for the workshop are being set up around the state.

It’s been a wait-and-see attitude among fish circles: Will Alaska’s catch limits again be reduced, down already 70 percent over a decade to just 16 million pounds? Or has the Pacific halibut stock started to rebound as some of the science indicates?Upcoming changes to the observer program for small vessels is the focus of the meeting tomorrow, Dec. 4 in Homer.Salmon, herring and state-managed fisheries at Prince William Sound and the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna Rivers will be the focus now that the Board of Fisheries is back to business in Cordova.

Sponge Bob, for example, could be the next rage in fiber optics. Researchers at Bell Labs have found that a certain type of sponge grows a network of glass fibers far more advanced than any found in today’s telecommunications networks.• New Zealand researchers have found that adding fish oil to animal feed reduces the release of methane gas by 25 to 40 percent in sheep. More than 20 percent of global methane emissions come from farm animals. The potent greenhouse gas traps nearly 20 times as much heat as carbon dioxide.• For hundreds of years, Asian cultures have used jellyfish to treat arthritis, high blood pressure and back pain. Some jellyfish have a special bio-luminescence useful in medical research.• Chitin, a substance found in the shells of crab, shrimp and other crustaceans, is packed with medical miracles. The carbohydrate that makes up chitin bonds with red blood cells to form an artificial clot, and seals massive bleeding wounds in just 30 seconds.

The lowly sea squirt appears to be especially promising.Fish bitsA first lawsuit is challenging a new federal rule that aims to clamp down on the use of hired skippers who fish halibut and sablefish quota shares owned by others. The rule takes effect Dec. 1, and will ban using a hired skipper to harvest any quota acquired after a cutoff date of Feb. 12, 2010.Since the Individual Fishing Quota plan was put in place in 1995, the number of hired skippers has topped 50 percent, and quota owners have been charging high rents for the fish which has inflated the cost for IFQs. The goal now is to get back to a predominantly owner-operated fleet that provides entry level opportunities for coastal Alaskans.Fairweather Fisheries of Gig Harbor, Wash., and Ray Welsh of Anchor Point, filed the 40-page complaint signed by six lawyers against NOAA Fisheries. Welsh claims the new law is discriminatory because he is disabled and can’t fish his quota. Fairweather claims, as a corporation, it relies on a hired skipper to harvest its shares. The lawsuit is filed in federal court at Tacoma.Fisherman-owned Silver Bay Seafoods of Sitka has announced that StarKist and Dongwon Fisheries of South Korea have acquired a 12.5 percent equity interest in Silver Bay. A spokesman said it will help build the Alaska brand from boat to retail shelves. Silver Bay was founded eight years ago, and has processing and freezing facilities in Sitka, Craig, Valdez, Bristol Bay and Metlakatla. The company also plans to expand to the squid fishery at Ventura, Calif.Ocean users’ guidePlanning and mapping ocean uses, both on and under, is a goal of the National Oceans Policy set in place by the Obama Administration in 2010. It is similar to land-use planning, but for marine waters, said Kathryn Sullivan, Administrator of the NOAA.The buzz phrase has become “ocean zoning,” but Sullivan said it is more correctly called Marine Spatial Planning, and is intended to bring together all ocean users, along with multiple layers of information, so everyone is on the same page.“It’s using basic Geographic Information Systems to guide community decisions,” she explained in a phone interview.“The central thrust of GIS is that, instead of having 12 people each bringing separate pieces of paper all done to different scales – we can bring them all together into one common, shared view.”Sullivan said with marine mapping, planners can consider the cumulative effects of ocean uses, make industries more sustainable and proactively minimize conflicts between all users. Ultimately, it helps form common understandings among people from coastal regions.<COL>Fisheries talk changes, catch limits and coastal cures<COL>2014-12-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/10/long-term-crab-fisheries-dependent-on-young-people/<COL>Long term crab fisheries dependent on ‘young people’By Laine WelchThe Bering Sea crab fleet now stands at 77 vessels — a far cry from the nearly 250 boats before the fishery downsized to catch shares in 2005. Fewer boats means less hands on deck, and — as with so many others —  the Bering Sea crabbers are “graying” and need to recruit young entrants to sustain the iconic fisheries. To do so, shareholders have devised a way to give captains and crews first crack at available crab.“The long-term future of the fishery is dependent on bringing young people in,” said Mark Gleason, executive director of harvester group Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers. “There just isn’t that pipeline of young people coming up through the ranks, and a ‘Right of First Offer’ program is one of the ways we hope to change that.”It has long been a goal of fishery managers to make sure active participants have access to crab quota shares. Gleason said in numerous workshops in recent years, ABSC got feedback from captains and crewmembers on road blocks to buying in, such as not knowing when quota was up for grabs and the need for smaller portions to buy. That helped shape the ROFO program.“Basically, it carves out a minimum 10 percent of a (catch share) transaction, and that is then offered on a Right of First Offer basis to active participants,” Gleason explained. “So there is prior notification when quota becomes available; it takes large blocks and chops them up into smaller chunks; and it increases transparency.”Gleason called it a more affordable way to get ownership in the crab fisheries, without the need to buy or build a big boat.“With quota-based management and the opportunity to buy smaller chunks of quota, a guy can get in with relatively little amount of money,” he said. “He can buy quota, bring that to the boat he’s fishing on, and use it to build his assets over time. That’s a new pathway into ownership in this fishery that never existed before.”All crab transactions are handled by permit brokers, such as Dock Street in Seattle, regarded as the “go-to” place for crab shares. Specialist Jeff Osborn admits availability is sketchy, and shares of red king crab are very rare. Dock Street currently has one listing for 120,000 pounds of snow crab at $20 per, and four listings of bairdi Tanners at $18-$20 per share. Shares of red king crab are reportedly valued in the $35 range.Bering Sea crabbers can register to be notified when quota becomes available at www.crabqs.com.Seafood bash gets biggerAlaska’s biggest seafood bash is expanding to include more new products and a third venue. Added to the traditional mix of retail, food service and smoked entries at the 22nd-annual Alaska Symphony of Seafood, judges and fish fans will taste and rate items in a new byproducts category called “Beyond the Plate.?”“The definition of this category is a consumer-ready product made with parts of seafood which would typically be deemed fish waste or a by-product of the primary processing,” said Julie Decker, Executive Director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, which hosts the Symphony.“The seafood industry has heavily invested in the development of new products from traditionally unused seafood parts,” Decker said. “We are excited to offer this new category to highlight and promote the improvements the industry has made to reduce fish waste, develop new products and increase the value of Alaska’s seafood.”All of the new products will be judged in February by a panel of experts in Seattle.  That’s followed by a seafood soiree in Anchorage, where all the winners are announced. Then, it’s off to a new venue – Juneau – for a third seafood celebration. The event is topped off for the winners with a trip and booth space at the International Boston Seafood Show in mid-March.“The multiple locations give seafood promoters the opportunity to introduce new value-added products from Alaska and gain exposure with industry and culinary experts, seafood distributors and national media,” Decker said. “The overall goal is to inspire innovative ways to use Alaska’s natural seafood resources.”The Symphony of Seafood dates in February and the” call for products” will be out by the end of October. Entry forms are due by Dec. 31. For more info, check out www.afdf.org/symphony-of-seafood/Diving for dollarsEvery October, swarms of divers head down to the depths for sea cucumbers, giant geoduck clams and sea urchins. Most of the action occurs in Southeast Alaska, where 70 divers search the bottom for booty. For cukes, the harvest guideline is just over 1 million pounds. That’s an increase of 8.5 percent from last year. For geoducks, the 750,000 harvest is a 12 percent decrease. Southeast’s red urchin availability often tops 5 million pounds, but there is little interest in that fishery which pays out at about 30 cents a pound.Kodiak is the only other region where dive fisheries for sea cucumbers and urchins occur, although on a much smaller scale. This year, the harvest for 20 divers is set at 140,000 pounds for cukes, which could fetch $5 a pound. No divers have signed on for more than 15 years for Kodiak’s green sea urchin fishery, which typically paid out at over $1 a pound.Fish WatchAlaska’s largest herring fishery at Togiak in Bristol Bay will be even bigger next year. State managers are expecting a harvest of 29,012 tons next spring; an increase of nearly 4,000 tons over the 2014 fishery. The grounds price was a dismal $50/ton. That could increase if processors add canning lines to their operations, instead of using only the herring roe.Salmon fishermen at Upper Cook Inlet caught fewer fish, but scored higher prices. The catch of 3.2 million sockeye salmon was 20 percent below the 10-year average, but the value of the fishery at $35 million was the ninth best since 1960. Sockeye salmon represents more than 90 percent of the value of the Upper Inlet fishery.<COL>Long term crab fisheries dependent on ‘young people’<COL>2014-10-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/08/alaskans-tell-dominos-pizza-quit-hatin-on-halibut/<COL>Alaskans tell Dominos’ Pizza, ‘quit hatin’ on halibut’Alaska salmon catches are poised to blow past the pre-season forecast of 179 million fish due to a plug of pinks that is coming in stronger than expected.“We are going to be short on sockeyes by five million or so, and we’re probably not going to make the chum salmon numbers either. So we’ll have to go over with pinks, but at the rate things are going that is entirely possible,” said Geron Bruce, deputy director of Fish and Game’s Commercial Fisheries division.As of Friday, the total pink salmon catch had surged to nearly 114 million (the forecast was for 118 million pinks, 73 percent higher than last year) – and catches were still coming on strong.Three regions provide the bulk of Alaska’s pink pack: Southeast, Prince William Sound and Kodiak. At Southeast, where 15 million humpies were taken in a single week, the catch had reached 43 million and is likely to exceed the 54 million forecast.“The next two weeks are typically the peak, so if catches stay at that level, that’s another 30 million pink salmon,” Bruce said.At Prince William Sound, the pink returns were so strong, fishermen were put on trip limits due to a lack of tender capacity. Still, they took 10 million pinks in a matter of days and the total PWS catch was approaching 57 million fish (the forecast was just over 38 million).Kodiak’s pink catch had topped nine million out of a 17 million pink forecast with steady catches coming in. Even the Alaska Peninsula was yielding larger catches than usual, topping five million pink salmon so far.At a dock price of roughly 45 cents a pound, pinks will really boost the value of Alaska’s total salmon fishery this summer.“When you’re talking about the volumes in these fisheries, that really drives up the value rapidly,” Bruce said.For the past couple of years, some salmon runs have peaked and waned early, as with Bristol Bay reds this summer. Bruce cautioned there is a chance that pinks could be following a similar trend.“But if the catches continue to remain high over the next week, we could end up close to 200 million pinks,” he said.If so, that will break the record pink salmon catch of 161 million taken in 2005.Halibut hateDominos’ Pizza is getting heat from Alaskans for a new national television ad called “Powered by Pizza.” The ill-advised campaign claims pizza is “the food of big ideas” – and in doing so, the ad demeans halibut.The narration says: “At Domino’s, we take our job seriously because we know Americans order pizza when they are building, creating and innovating. Without pizza, school projects and music albums might go unfinished…startups unstarted…No one is coming up with a world-changing idea over halibut. No way.”At the same time, an on-screen actor takes a mouthful of halibut with a plastic fork, and then spits it with a look of disgust on his face!Alaskans quickly let Domino’s know of their displeasure. Senator Mark Begich entered the fray telling Domino’s they obviously have never sampled one of Alaska’s iconic fish, and urging them to stop being “a halibut hater.”Jeanne Devon of The Mudflats blog fame contacted Domino’s and got a quick response from Tim McIntyre, VP of communications.“In no way did we intend to disparage the hard-working men and women in the fishing industry… It was simply meant to be a bit of humor,” he said, adding that Domino’s was “sincerely sorry for any offense the ad caused.”But … the fish-offensive ad is still running nationwide!Well, Domino’s is obviously oblivious to the fact that the adage “fish is brain food” is not just an old wives tale. Several studies in Europe and the U.S. have proven, among other things, that pregnant women who eat fish promote brain development in their babies. And elderly people who eat fish at least once a week are less likely to develop dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Now, that’s brain power!A “Team Fish” campaign is gaining steam and urging Alaskans to contact Domino’s with Twitter – using the hash tag “Powered by Halibut” or via Domino’s Facebook page. So far, the response to the ad has reportedly been intense – and it is likely to remain so until Domino’s Pizza pulls the attack ad that treats halibut as an inedible food choice.Fish watchThere will be even fewer sockeye salmon to meet strong market demand this summer.By now, British Columbia’s Fraser River reds are usually filling orders as the Alaska catch tails off, but dismal returns mean it is likely there won’t even be a Fraser fishery.The lack of reds will push prices even higher. … Alaska longliners have taken 61 percent of the nearly 22 million pound halibut catch limit. For sablefish, the catch tally was at 68 percent of the 28 million pound quota.Southeast Alaska’s Dungeness crab fishery ended Aug. 8 — a week earlier than usual. That catch should top two million pounds and the dungy fishery will reopen Oct. 1. The year’s first king crab fishery is underway at Norton Sound where 35 small boat crabbers have a half million pound quota. The golden king crab fishery way out along the Aleutian Islands starts Aug. 15 – that harvest will top six million pounds.Pollock boats are back out on the water in the Bering Sea; trawlers also are targeting cod, and pot cod opens Sept. 1. In the Gulf, pollock reopens Aug. 25, mostly around Kodiak. Cod opens for all gears in the Gulf (except jig) on Sept. 1.<COL>Alaskans tell Dominos’ Pizza, ‘quit hatin’ on halibut’<COL>2013-08-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/11/alaskas-largest-employer-continues-to-add-more-jobs/<COL>Alaska’s largest employer continues to add more jobsBy Laine WelchCommercial fishing jobs grew last year to a level not seen since the year 2000, according to the State Department of Labor.  Driven primarily by an increased salmon harvest — notably from the record run of pinks — fishing jobs grew by nearly 2.5 percent last year.  That brought the annual monthly average to 8,400 jobs, just 400 shy of the record more than a decade ago.Seafood harvesting and processing jobs are a focus of the November Alaska Economic Trends, which breaks down the numbers by region. Some highlights:• Salmon fishing jobs were the main source of growth between 2012 and 2013, with a statewide gain of 452 jobs, or 10 percent.• Salmon at Bristol Bay accounted for 98 percent of harvesting jobs, and 73 percent in the South Central region.• Alaska crabbing dropped by about 100 jobs over those two years, down 17 percent. The average loss for groundfish harvesting jobs was 187 jobs, or 15 percent.• Southeast Alaska has steadily been generating the most fishing jobs at 2,510, gaining 210 last year – the most since 2000. Southcentral was next at 1,619 jobs, due to the region’s halibut fleets and the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet salmon fisheries. The Aleutians/Pribilof Islands ranked third for fishing employment at 1,513, followed by Bristol Bay with 1,364. Conversely, jobs in Kodiak fisheries dropped nearly 13 percent last year to 770 due to decreased landings of halibut and groundfish. A total of 380 fishing jobs was listed for the Yukon Delta,and 146 for the “Northern” region.The Trends report also highlights jobs in 170 Alaska seafood processing plants, which are projected to grow by nearly seven percent through 2022; the highest-paid processing occupations are expected to grow at nearly twice that rate. These jobs are related to high-level management, engineering, metal fabrication installation, maintenance and repair.Because of the remoteness of Alaska’s fisheries and the low resident population, it’s necessary for processors to seasonally bring in nonresident workers, which top 73 percent.Interestingly, next to slime line workers, the highest rates of nonresident workers were among vessel engineers (59.5 percent); captains, mates and boat pilots.The Economic Trends report also looks at Alaska’s Community Development Quota program. Find it at http://labor.alaska.gov/trends/nov14.pdfSalmon loveShrimp remained America’s favorite seafood last year, but Alaska is credited for pushing salmon to the second spot due to the huge production of pink salmon. That’s according to the National Fisheries Institute, which compiles a top-10 list of seafood favorites each year based on NOAA’s annual Fisheries of the U.S. report. The list makes up nearly 97 percent of all the seafood Americans eat.Each American ate 2.7 pounds of salmon in 2013 — an overall 34 percent increase from the year before. Imports of farmed salmon increased just 5 percent to 620 million pounds – meaning it was Alaska salmon that drove increased consumption, said market expert John Sackton. He added that salmon imports to date this year are up 8 percent, meaning American’s strong usage of salmon is continuing. Salmon pushed canned tuna to third place for favorites, with per capita consumption of tuna down 4 percent.Cod moved up a notch to seventh place with a nice 16 percent jump in U.S. per capita consumption. Sackton said that increase stems from more availability from that million tons of cod coming out of the Barents Sea.Rounding out the Top 10 list of seafood favorites were catfish, crab and clams.In all, each American ate 14.5 pounds of seafood last year, the same as in 2012. The NOAA report says imports represented 94 percent of all seafood eaten, but that figure is being reworked. For one thing, it doesn’t reflect seafood sent to China for processing and then re-imported to the U.S.Fish watchAlaska’s halibut fishery ended Friday and nearly all of the 16 million pound catch was  pulled aboard during the eight month season. It’s a toss-up to see which will be the top halibut port; Homer’s lead was only about 150,000 pounds more than Kodiak. The halibut fishery will reopen in March.Sablefish also ended on Nov. 7, with longliners taking about 90 percent of that 24 million-pound quota.Bering Sea crabbers were making short work of the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay. In little more than two weeks, the fleet had taken 90 percent of their 10 million pound quota. No word on dock prices, which might not settle out until mid-January, said Jake Jacobsen of the crabbers’ Inter-Cooperative Exchange.  Processors have been offering king crab at wholesale for $13 per pound, 50-cents less than last year, according to market reports.Jacobsen said the unexpected 15 million pound Tanner crab fishery might run through the end of March, with price negotiations continuing through June.Congratulations to Nick Sagalkin of Kodiak, who was named ADF&G Supervisor of the Westward region.

It would turn the tide of a decades-long decline that has caused halibut catches to be slashed by more than 70 percent in Alaska, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.Three Alaska areas showed improvement in the annual stock surveys that range from Oregon to the Bering Sea, and could have higher catch levels in 2015. That’s according to information revealed at the International Pacific Halibut Commission’s interim meeting last week in Seattle.Two are the most prime halibut fishing spots: Southeast and the Central Gulf; the third is the Alaska Peninsula Region.Surveys showed the fish are still growing much slower than normal, but after more than a decade of conservative management, the halibut stock is showing signs of rebounding. Surveys this year showed total weights per unit of effort (fishing gear) were 6 percent higher than in 2013.“The trend estimates for this year are a bit more optimistic,” said Ian Stewart, a quantitative scientist with the IPHC. “What we are starting to see is more sensitivity to management actions than we have seen in previous years. As the stock begins to stabilize at this level, the level of catch is becoming relatively even more important to future trends.”Stewart added that it’s unclear what is causing the individual halibut to grow so slowly.“Probably climate change and prey, or competition with other species, perhaps density dependence and size selective fishing are all playing a role,” he said.One change in factoring the halibut catches is a full accounting for all sizes and sources of fish removals, including for first-time guided sport charters.The 2014 coast-wide halibut catch was 27.5 million pounds; Alaska’s share was about16 million pounds. Final catch decisions for 2015 will be made at the IPHC annual meeting Jan. 26-30 in Vancouver.  (www.iphc.int)One fish, two fishTallies for all seafood crossing Alaska docks this year are trickling out from various fishing agencies, and — as usual — they show ups and downs.Starting with salmon, the 2014 statewide harvest totaled 157 million fish with a dockside value of nearly $577 million. That’s 116 million fewer salmon than last year, and $113 million less, according to the state Commercial Fisheries Division.Prices to fishermen took a dip for three of the five salmon species:Chinook salmon averaged $4.07 per pound, compared to $5.31 last year; sockeyes averaged $1.37, down from $1.60. For pink salmon, the average price was $.30 a pound, down a dime. On the up side, coho prices increased by $.07 to average $1.15; likewise, chums increased $.08 to $.60 pound.Alaska’s halibut fishermen enjoyed high halibut prices during the eight-month season that ended in early November. This year, 1,989 long liners participated in the fishery; 35 less than last year, said Troie Zuniga at NOAA Fisheries in Juneau.The average dockside halibut price this year was $6.36 a pound, an increase of $1.30 over last year. Still, the overall dockside value of the halibut fishery at $100 million is down $5 million from last year. Once again, Homer held on to the top spot for halibut landings, beating out Kodiak by less than 150,000 pounds for the season (2,762,345 pounds vs. 2,613,194).  Seward and Petersburg were the other top ports for halibut landings.For sablefish, or black cod, the average fisherman’s price was $3.59 a pound this year, a $.55 increase. The value of Alaska’s sablefish fishery at $76 million is $4 higher than last year.The value of the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay took a big dip in 2014 to $209 million, down $22 million from a year ago. The decrease is blamed primarily on competition from pirated king crab from Russian fleets that are flooding the market. The Alaska crab price this year averaged $6.10, down more than a dollar.Tanner time outThe popular Tanner crab fishery at Kodiak is on hold again for a second year; likewise, at Chignik and the Alaska Peninsula.“Based on the results of our 2014 crab survey, the abundance of legal-size male Tanner crab were all below the minimum threshold for us to have a commercial fishery,” said Mark Stichert, area manager at the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game at Kodiak.There is a bright side: the surveys also showed one of the largest waves ever poised to enter the Tanner fishery since the late 1980s.“In fact, the total abundance of crab specifically in Kodiak was the third or fourth highest in the time series of our survey. So there is still a lot of Tanner crab in the water, but they are fairly small,” Stichert added.The crab recruits measure between 2.5-3.5 inches, Stichert said, still shy of the 5.5 inch legal size.“So we are cautiously optimistic that those crab will continue to persist and translate into a fishery down the road,” Stichert said. “But we are looking forward to potentially having stronger seasons again, or reopening again, potentially next year and more likely 2017.”It takes about six years for Tanner crab to grow to their full, two-pound size. That’s an educated guess, Stichert said, because crabs can’t be aged by scales or ear bones, like other species.“We think a male Tanner crab will molt up to 15 to 16 times throughout their life history, but we don’t really have a method of aging crab and getting a good idea of how much they grow year to year, or how old they really are when they hit the fishery,” he explained.The mid-January Tanner season provides a nice mid-winter boost to 50 or more Kodiak boats and about 30 at the Peninsula. The 2013 total catch was less than 1 million pounds, but it still brought in several million dollars to local communities.Share the SeaProviding 1 million seafood meals to hungry Americans during the holidays is the goal of a month-long campaign by SeaShare, a Seattle-based nonprofit that for 20 years has provided seafood to food banks across the nation.Starting with its “bycatch to food banks” campaign in the 1990s, SeaShare has built a nationwide network that includes fishermen, seafood processors, freight, storage and packaging companies and financial donors to get valuable seafood protein to the needy.The Share the Sea campaign began Dec.1 and aims to receive enough donations to provide one million servings of seafood to the food bank network.

Furthermore, they rate the health and abundance of salmon as a top concern on par with the federal budget deficit, and even higher than concerns about jobs.Those are the primary results of a new survey of 500 Alaska voters done by Public Opinion Strategies for the Alaska chapter of The Nature Conservancy. (The survey also conducted additional interviews to reach 200 respondents in the Mat-Su Valley and 200 in the Southeast Alaska regions.)According to an executive summary, the strong connection to salmon extends across all ages, ethnicity, demographic and partisan sub-groups, with Native Alaskans and voters in Southeast showing the strongest personal connections on multiple questions.In the survey, 96 percent of Alaskans said salmon are essential to the Alaskan way of life, and 97 percent said salmon are an important part of the Alaska economy.  Statewide, 89 percent said that even in tough economic times, it is important to maintain funding for salmon conservation.  Four of every five Alaskans polled said they are personally concerned about the health and abundance of salmon in Alaska.Other noteworthy findings:• 93 percent of Alaskans say protecting Bristol Bay is important and 91 percent of southeast Alaskans say it is important to protect the Tongass National Forest.• 78 percent of residents of the Mat-Su region report fishing for food for the family in the last year; 95 percent said salmon are essential to the Alaskan way of life.More than eight out of ten Alaskans say protecting the forest, tundra and wetlands around streams is as important as protecting the streams themselves.• 58 percent of all Alaska voters and 69 percent of Southeast Alaskans said they would have a more favorable impression of a community leader who worked to maintain the level of funding that helps protect and manage salmon, salmon streams and the lands along those streams.• Two-thirds of Alaskans eat salmon at least once a month.Statewide, 79 percent of Alaskans are concerned about pollution of rivers, lakes and streams (55% very or extremely concerned) which is on par with pocketbook issues like unemployment and the deficit.• A majority of Alaska voters support a number of specific actions to conserve salmon and its habitat, including increasing funding even if it requires an increase in taxes.• 93 percent of state residents believe developers should be required to leave a certain amount of water flowing through streams and rivers to ensure the health of salmon and other fish and wildlife.• 77 percent say a natural filter of undisturbed forest, wetland or tundra should be required along salmon streams.• 83 percent say land should be conserved in its natural state along salmon rivers and the streams that flow into them.• 81 percent says rivers and streams that were damaged by past development should be restored.• 75 percent say it should be a  priority to create special areas that protect free flowing salmon streams from pollution.The Nature Conservancy is a non-profit conservation group that leads salmon habitat projects in Bristol Bay, the Matanuska-Susitna Basin, and the Tongass National Forest regions in Alaska.Coal noteStill no word from the Dept. of Natural Resources on the Unsuitable Lands Petition that requests buffer zones (similar to logging operations) to protect salmon streams on the Upper Cook Inlet’s Chuitna River, should Alaska’s largest strip coal mine get the state’s OK.A decision was due on April 19, but the state asked for a 45 day extension until June 3.  In a June 7 email, DNR’s Ed Fogle said they “are jamming to get the decision out the door.”There is no mention of the petition status, nor any other updates since Feb.1 on the DNR website.   http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/coal/chuit/index.htmHerring hypotheses – Prince William Sound was home to Alaska’s most lucrative herring fisheries until the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and the stocks have struggled to recover since 1993.  A new scientific report claims the collapse is likely due to the release of up to 600 million juvenile pink salmon each year into the Sound, which has the fry and herring competing for food.Another cause might come from humpback whales that overwinter in Prince William Sound and feast on herring, although the report said more research is needed on that hypothesis. Researchers said they found no evidence that lingering effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill are to blame. ?       The report, titled Hypotheses concerning the decline and poor recovery of Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, is funded in part by  Exxon Mobil Corp.Death by sunscreen – All that sun block being slathered on by beach-goers around the world is causing major damage to ocean corals. A study funded by the European Commission revealed that the mix of 20 compounds used to protect skin from the harmful effects of the sun causes rapid bleaching of coral reefs.  ? 	The World Trade Organization reports that 10 per cent of world tourism takes place in tropical areas, with nearly 80 million people visiting coral reefs each year. The WTO estimates up to 6,000 tons of sun screen lotions are released into reef areas each year – and that up to 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs are at risk of ‘death by sunscreen. ? 	While Alaska’s deep sea corals face threats from ocean acidification, they are safe from sun screens. Unlike tropical varieties, Alaska corals don’t form reefs – they grow into dense gardens and can live for hundreds of years.  The waters surrounding the Aleutian Islands are believed to harbor the most abundant and diverse coldwater corals in the world.   ??Death by plastics – Researchers found plastic in nearly 1 in 10 small fish collected in the northern Pacific Ocean in the latest study to call attention to floating marine debris entering the food chain.  A new study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at San Diego estimated that fish in the northern Pacific Ocean are ingesting as much as 24,000 tons of plastic each year.  The L.A. Times said the study raises concerns that plastics and pollutants they contain could be making their way up the food chain into seafood ingested by humans.<COL>Salmon deemed essential to Alaskan’s lives<COL>2011-07-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/11/coming-soon-to-a-small-halibut-boat-near-you-fishery-observers/<COL>Coming soon to a small halibut boat near you: fishery observers.By Laine WelchNew rules set for 2013 will change how observers are placed on fishing boats as small as 40 feet – and for the first time, they will be aboard longliners.Onboard observers have been deployed on larger U.S. vessels since the early 1990’s, when fisheries were “Americanized” and all foreign fishing within a 200 mile zone of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska was terminated. Prior to that, fleets from Japan, Russia, Poland and other nations were tapping Alaska’s groundfish and crab resources starting in 1933.Fishery observers, who are trained and overseen by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Monitoring and Analysis Division, do not play an enforcement role; rather, they take biological samples of the catch, track bycatch and collect other data for fishery managers and scientists. Observers also are on the job in Alaska processing plants during fish deliveries. Currently, there are about 400 observers working in Alaska’s seafood industry.Observers were originally deployed according to vessel length. Boats less than 60 feet were exempt from coverage; vessels from 60-125 feet carried observers 30% of the time, and larger vessels had 100% or more coverage.The “restructured” observer program will expand coverage to vessels “all the way down to 40 feet, and NMFS has the authority to place observers on vessels below that,” explained Julie Bonney, a trawl  industry consultant and director of Alaska Groundfish Data Bank in Kodiak.And for the first time observers will be aboard longline vessels.“There’s never been observer coverage in the IFQ halibut fisheries, so now we’ll have information from that sector, as well as all the small vessels,” Bonney said.  “We all have issues and we all need to work hard to address those. So getting that information will help us understand how we can move forward in the best practices.”Another fisheries first – for both Alaska and the U.S. – collecting data via video cameras that monitor the catch.“Vessels in the 40 to 57.5 foot sector that are not capable of carrying another person on board  can have that as an option,” Bonney explained.“It’s kind of exciting because electronic monitoring has not been approved in any regional areas in the US as a monitoring tool. So this will really push the envelope to move that technology forward through the observer restructuring package.”The 2013 launch of the retooled observer program depends on getting a $3.8 million jump start from Congress. Alaska is the only state where for over 20 years, the seafood industry has paid for fishery observer coverage.   Senator Mark Begich said it is time for the federal government to kick in a little.“We’ve been doing it all along with our own money. This is an important national resource it is a small amount that can be added to make sure we maintain our sustainable fisheries,” Begich said at a press conference.“The good news is that it has made it through the process to date, which is very positive. They are working under the financial limitations and caps of the budget, so that’s good,” he added.Learn more about Alaska’s fishery observer program atwww.afsc.noaa.gov/FMA/default.htm.AK opinions – A statewide poll of 802 Alaska voters done last month asked opinions of various public figures, industries and issues. The poll was done by research powerhouse Strategies 360 for the Bristol Bay Native Corporation and included voters from all demographics and regions.A sampler:  54% said they believe Alaska is heading in the right direction; 27% said the economy and jobs is the most important issue facing Alaska today.The fishing industry got the highest favorable rating at 79% followed by the Alaska gas pipeline at 75%, and the oil and gas industry at 66%.Senator Lisa Murkowski had a 61% favorable rating, Governor Parnell was at 52%, Rep. Don Young at 51% and Sen. Mark Begich at 48%.   The Alaska legislature had a 45% favorable rating by voters.The proposed Pebble Mine ranked last among voters with an unfavorable rating of 54%.Meanwhile, as exploration at the Pebble site expands, BBNC President and CEO Jason Metrokin said he worries that the state Dept. of Natural Resources simply doesn’t have the manpower to monitor a project the size of Pebble, along with other big development projects.“From what we’ve seen the DNR has not been able to handle sizeable projects that are on the time and horizon today. The project is expanding, the potential footprint is getting larger, and there is a lot of activity happening in Bristol Bay today. We are not convinced the state is doing its part to monitor this exploration,” Metrokin said in a phone interview.  “But beyond that, if the Pebble project continues to go forward and they  get into a permit application phase late next year, is the state prepared to take on that process, knowing that there are several other development projects happening around the state? The DNR should be gearing up and staffing up and resourcing up now in order to prepare for something like that, and we just don’t see that happening.”See the voter survey atwww.bbnc.net/images/stories/newfolder/release_toplines.pdfFish watch – The Southeast red king crab fishery (201,000 pounds) ended Nov. 13. The Bristol Bay red king crab fishery (7.8 million pounds) wrapped up on the15th.  The halibut fishery ended on Nov. 18 and when all the final numbers are tallied, the catch should hit the 30 million pound target. Industry will find out at the end of November how much halibut might be available in 2012 when preliminary catch limits are unveiled by the International Pacific Halibut Commission in Seattle. The sablefish (black cod) fishery also ended on the 18th and it looks like nearly 3 million pounds might be left in the water from the nearly 27 million pound quota. The Bering Sea 2012 pollock catch is likely to be set at 1.08 million tons, down 180,000 tons from this year.<COL>Coming soon to a small halibut boat near you: fishery observers.<COL>2011-11-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/12/help-for-fisheries-ahead-in-2013/<COL>Help for fisheries ahead in 2013Alaska’s commercial fisheries programs could get a slight boost if the Governor’s budget for the next fiscal year gets a nod from legislators.The proposed  FY2013 operating budget for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, including all state and federal funds, is just over $209 million, a 5.1 percent increase. For commercial fisheries, the department’s most expensive unit, a budget of $70.5 million is a 4.4 percent increase.Gov. Parnell also is proposing a bond package that includes $10 million to help Seward prepare to homeport large at-sea processing boats owned by communities in the Kuskokwim region.  The vessels now are based in Seattle, and it could begin a transfer of other big boats to remain in Alaska year round.In the ADF&G budget, Commissioner Cora Campbell listed harvest management as a top budget item for fisheries. The report highlighted Yukon River salmon fisheries as a management priority due to its continued low productivity of Chinook.  Another is managing Southcentral region Chinook salmon fisheries in the face of low numbers of returning adults.  The state Board of Fish has designated seven king salmon “stocks of concern”, six in Northern Cook Inlet and one in Kodiak.The ADF&G budget report cites several fishery successes in the past year.   Managers achieved a huge milestone in rebuilding Alaska snow crab stocks to sustainable levels within a federally mandated 10 year time frame, while still providing a viable harvest. Also mentioned:  Alaska’s 2011 salmon harvest was the 3rd best since 1975; and the second best for groundfish in a decade.

Health and Social Services at 65; ADF&G at 59; and the Dept. of Transportation would lose 58 jobs.Deleted positions in other agencies range from 22 to zero within the university system, according to an Associated Press report. The AP said: “Parnell’s spokeswoman said most of the positions were vacant at least 11 months. The deleted posts are intended to help the state better absorb positions needed for a new prison.”Future fishermen– Building future fishing leaders is the goal of the Alaska Young Fishermen’s Summit scheduled for mid February in Juneau. The Summit began in 2007 as a way to address the many changes the industry and the business of fishing have undergone in recent years. The two day event provides basic training on four fronts:   managing the financial aspects of a fishing business, participating in the regulatory   processes, Alaska’s role in the world seafood market  and  the science and management of  sustainable fisheries.“It’s complicated— there are state managed fisheries, federally managed fisheries, hatcheries,   people are looking at more financing to get into the fisheries, and the global marketplace has changed,” said AYFS co-organizer Sunny Rice, a Sea Grant Marine Advisory agent in Petersburg.Summit attendees will hear from fishermen who have participated in the political process, network with young and old fishing veterans, and mix with a wide range of industry experts – including Fish and Game Commissioner Cora Campbell, who will talk about “where and how a young fisherman can get involved.”  Fishermen also will see the Alaska legislature at work in Juneau.Nearly 200 fishermen have taken part in the AYFS so far and Rice said one thing is for sure — young people are eager for a fishing career.“I’ve seen an exciting uptick of young people wanting to get into the fisheries and they are coming at it with a cool perspective,” she said. “They think it is exciting and they are really dedicated to all the things that go along with it. It’s not just because it’s the closest job nearby that can make them some money.”The AYFS is set for Feb 13-14 in Juneau. Some travel scholarships are available, as are Alaska Airlines discounted constituent fares.  Rice cautioned that lodging in Juneau is really tight.

Meyers added that the state is “sort of in a holding pattern,” awaiting more information.The West Coast fishing industry was stunned last week when Canadian scientists at Simon Fraser University detected Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) in two wild sockeye smolts at Rivers Inlet in northern British Columbia. ISA is harmless to humans, but it is the single most feared virus in the fish industry.The highly contagious virus can quickly kill tens of millions of fish confined in net pens, as happened with Chile’s multi-billion dollar farmed salmon industry in 2007. Fish farms in Norway and Scotland also have suffered lethal ISA outbreaks. The big unknown is how vulnerable wild Pacific salmon and also herring might be.Virus experts called the news “alarming” but cautioned that the test results do not indicate how wide-ranging the virus is, and the results have not been confirmed by additional testing.“Anytime ISA is present, there is potential for an outbreak,” said Jim Winton, a microbiologist at the USGS Western Fisheries Research Center in Washington. “The virus has great potential to mutate, which raises concerns about its impact on wild salmon.”Neighboring U.S. senators want answers fast. Sens. Murkowski and Begich of Alaska and Cantwell of Washington state have already asked Congress to require federal agencies to assess the ISA virus risks to Pacific fish and report back in six months.King crab prices soar– A price of $9 a pound for Alaska red king crab reflects a “market frenzy seen only twice in the past,” said industry expert John Sackton of Seafood.com. He was referring to 1994 when the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay was closed, and in 1999 when purchases for “millennium” celebrations led to a price surge.The reduced Bering Sea harvest of red king crab to just eight million pounds has buyers scrambling for product, especially by Alaska’s number one customer: Japan. With a strong yen to dollar exchange rate, as much as 80 percent of the Bristol Bay king crab pack is likely to go to Japan.The U.S. also has a big appetite for Alaska crab and those customers will likely enjoy the six million pounds of lower priced golden king crab caught around the Aleutian Islands, and the 2 million pounds of blue king crab from St. Matthew Island off Norton Sound.“King crab is not differentiated in the US, but it is in Japan, so the golden and blue kings will stay in the US,” Sackton said. “So the overall ratio for Alaska king crab between the US and Japan will be closer to 50/50.”The Bristol Bay king crab fishery got underway on Oct. 15. It usually wraps up by late November in order to make sales deadlines for the holidays.Price check!The first thing fishermen want to know is the prices for their fish, but sometimes that can be tough to come by. Final sales for most of Alaska’s seafood are made long after a fishery closes, and settlements to fishermen may not be known for several months. But there is an easy way to find out how fish prices are tracking. The state Dept. of Revenue’s Tax Division compiles prices for every kind of fish and shellfish caught by Alaska fishermen by region. The prices are not in-season; they show a snapshot of the previous year and how fish prices are trending.Here’s a sampler from 2010: Alaska halibut went from a low of $4.49 a pound on the Alaska Peninsula, to a high of $5.17 in the Cook Inlet region. The highest price average paid for sablefish was $5.97 at Juneau/Yakutat to a low of $5.46 at Ketchikan/Craig. Herring at Bristol Bay averaged 7 cents a pound last year to a high of 65-cents at Ketchikan. Octopus fetched 45 cents at Kodiak and a nickel a pound for squid. Gray cod got the lowest price at 13-cents at Petersburg/Wrangell to a high of 49-cents at Sitka/Pelican. Lingcod went for a low of 46 cents at Kodiak, up to $1.22 at Juneau.Kodiak fishermen got the lowest price for Chinook salmon at just 64 cents per pound compared to $5.41 at Prince William Sound. Chums saw a low of 28 cents at Bristol Bay to a high of 86 cents at Sitka/ Pelican. Cohos fetched 50 cents a pound at the Alaska Peninsula and averaged $1.55 at Sitka. The lowest price for pinks was at Cook Inlet at 30 cents to a high of 44 cents at Kodiak, Petersburg and Wrangell. For sockeye salmon the lowest price was at Bristol Bay at $1.07; the high topped $2 a pound at the Prince William Sound region.There are prices for 15 different kinds of rockfish on the list – the lowest paid was a dime paid at Kodiak for red banded rockfish to a high of $1.42 for thorny heads at Dutch Harbor. The priciest Alaska seafood last year? Spot shrimp at $7.81delivered to Juneau/Yakutat, followed by Bristol Bay red king crab $7.42 a pound. The lowest valued were rex sole, flathead sole and arrowtooth flounder, each at 2 pennies per pound.<COL>Risk from fish virus low, but still unknown<COL>2011-10-26<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/10/red-king-crab-fishery-cut-47-percent/<COL>Red King Crab fishery cut 47 percentBy Laine WelchBering Sea crabbers got good news and bad news last week when catch quotas were announced for fisheries that open next week.The bad news:  the catch for Alaska’s most famous crab fishery – Bristol Bay red kings – was slashed by 47 percent to just 7.8 million pounds. Crabbers were expecting a reduced harvest, but they were shocked by the big drop.The crab harvest is the second lowest since 2001 when 7.1 million pounds were taken, according to Wayne Donaldson, a longtime crab biologist at ADF&G in Kodiak.The Bristol Bay king crab catches have been trending downwards for several years due to low numbers of legal sized males recruiting into the fishery, the only crabs that can be retained for sale.  There are hopeful signs of stronger year classes showing up – but it is slow going,  as it takes about seven years for the crab to reach market size.Prices for red king crab set a record last year, averaging $7.42/lb at Dutch Harbor ($7.32/lb delivered at Kodiak), making the value close to $112 million at the docks.  Since the bulk of Alaska’s king crab goes to Japan, prices are likely to be high again this season because the yen is very strong against a weakened US dollar.  The king crab season opens Oct. 15.The good news:  Bering Sea crabbers also were shocked at the catch increase for Alaska’s largest crab fishery, snow crab. The harvest for the 2011/2012 season was boosted by 64 percent to nearly 90 million pounds.The snow crab fishery is likely to remain at that level for several years, or go higher.  Based on annual trawl surveys, biologists estimate the total mature snow crab population has surged to more than one billion pounds.  Most importantly, it means Alaska’s snow crab fishery now merits “rebuilt” status by federal overseers, following a collapse of the stocks over a decade ago.The average base price for Alaska snow crab last season was $2.12/lb, compared to $1.25 the previous year, making the fishery worth $103 million at the docks.Gooey ducksUrchins and gooeys and sea cukes, oh my! Each October divers head down to the frigid ocean floor around Southeast Alaska and Kodiak Island, searching for urchins, sea cucumbers and giant geoduck clams (called gooeyducks).Kodiak’s fisheries attract fewer than 20 divers, who this year will compete for roughly 150,000 pounds of sea cucumbers; none has signed up for the green urchin fishery (60,000 pounds) for several years.Southeast is “dive central” and has several hundred permit holders on the books – 180 are active in the sea cucumber fishery, 70 for geoducks, and three for red urchins.  Divers use scuba gear or more commonly, hookah gear to seek out their catches.Geoduck clams, which weigh 2.5 pounds on average, have a harvest limit of 560,000 pounds this year.  The clams are sold live to Asian markets, and are fetching $9/lb, compared to $7.50 last year.Just under one million pounds of sea cucumbers are up for grabs, and they also are destined for Asia. Cukes, which average half a pound, also are worth more this year at $4.25/lb, up from $2.50.The higher prices will result in ex-vessel values to Panhandle communities of $5 million and $4.25 million, respectively.Hebert said Southeast Alaska’s dive fisheries are “fully developed,” and there is not much opportunity for expansion. Plus, the fisheries face a growing threat: sea otters.“There is quite a lot of impact on all these species from sea otters.   It’s probably the single most thing that is threatening the fisheries,” Hebert said.Surveys this past year saw dramatic declines of red urchins and geoducks in once plentiful areas, and Hebert said all evidence points to otters.  Broken urchin shells and spines are left behind, and the same goes for geoducks.“If we are in a sea otter area, we will see large craters that have been dug up by sea otters, pits that might be five or six feet across, and we’ll see freshly broken geoduck shells,” Hebert said.It is harder to tell with sea cucumbers because no clues remain.“It’s more circumstantial evidence,” he added. “You see large, rapid declines of biomass where there are large numbers of sea otters in an area, and the presumption is they are eating the  sea cucumbers. In some areas that used to be very productive, now there is virtually zero.”Salmon wraps – State fishery managers stopped posting salmon catch updates on September 16, and the early statewide tally  is 172 million fish.  Some highlights include the bumper catch of  pink salmon in Southeast Alaska at nearly 59 million, blowing past the 55 million forecast. At an average at 40-cents a pound, pinks will ring in at more than $23.5 million at the Southeast docks. Southeast also hauled in the most coho salmon at about 1.8 million, and chums at more than 15 million, although catches for both species are below forecasts statewide. The exception is the AYK region where more than one million chums were taken; more than half from the Yukon River.For the big money fish – Alaska sockeye – Cook Inlet hit the jackpot with nearly 5.5 million reds, more than double what was expected.   . Of course, it’ s sockeye from Bristol Bay that provide the biggest boost to the industry’s bottom line, accounting  for over half the value of Alaska’s total salmon fishery.Fish managers summed up the run this year as ‘early and weaker than forecast.’ The catch of 22 million reds was 27% below projections, but   close to long term averages.“The last several years we have had very high production from all systems in the Bay, well above historic averages and at the top of the data sets. To have folks expect that to maintain for indefinite periods is not very realistic,” said ADF&G’s Paul Salomone.Despite the lower numbers, the value of the sockeye catch ranks in the top six for the past 20 years. The average base price of $1/lb is up a nickel from last year, and adds up to a $136 million pay day for the Bay.   That value will be much higher, as that  figure does not include bonuses for chilled fish or other post season price adjustments.<COL>Red King Crab fishery cut 47 percent<COL>2011-10-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2012/06/cranes-symbols-of-marriage-fidelity/<COL>Cranes symbols of marriage fidelityBy Kachemak Crane WatchWhere do cranes nest and what materials do they use to build their nests?Sandhill Cranes are ground nesters, building their nests primarily in wetlands, but also in upland grassy areas. Cranes create a nest from whatever plants are available. In the Homer area, cranes use both wetlands and upland areas. Known nests consist primarily of grasses and sedges. When the cranes return in the spring, the grasses and sedges are dull brown in color, offering cranes sufficient camouflage to help prevent detection from predators. Cranes often paint their feathers with mud to help them blend in with surrounding vegetation.  The mud stains their gray feathers a rich brown/rust color. The more rust colored the feathers, the more iron in the soil used to paint. Cranes who paint their feathers are much more difficult to see on their nests.Cranes establish nesting territories and will return each year to that territory. However, cranes do not necessarily use the same nest. At one known nesting location,  cranes used three different locations within their territory in the past three years.Cranes may abandon their territory due to: (1) Loss of nest or chicks, (2) disturbance by humans or predators (including dogs), (3) nesting pair are young inexperienced birds, (4) lack of adequate food or water in the territory, (5) conflicts with neighboring pairs or aggressive non-paired cranes, (6) loss of mate.Do cranes mate for life? When do they first nest?Cranes are considered symbols of marriage fidelity and loyalty. These long-lived birds, which can live 25-40 years in the wild, are basically monogamous and “mate for life.”On average, they usually don’t begin nesting or egg-laying until around age 4 or 5, and may not successfully breed the first few attempts.Sometimes the pair may divorce in this early stage of pair bonding.  Those that are successful will form permanent pair bonds, possibly for the rest of their lives. Occasionally, however, even older pairs may divorce.Cranes are sometimes killed by predators, hunters, or accidents with cars or powerlines. In this case, the crane will likely seek another compatible mate.The elaborate dances that crane pairs often perform is part of the pair bonding ritual. These intricate performances will include bowing with stretched out wings, leaping high into the air, throwing sticks or plants, as well as other moves. Often these dances occur before the nest is ready and just before the pair copulates.The pair stays together throughout the year.  If they have colts, the whole family will migrate south together and return to the nesting territory in the spring.  Then the colts will be driven off the territory.<COL>Cranes symbols of marriage fidelity<COL>2012-06-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2010/12/sea-yields-unique-products-for-technology/<COL>Sea yields unique products for technologyby Laine WelchDuring the season of gift-giving, don’t overlook the gifts from the sea.Sponge Bob, for example, is set to be the next rage in fiber optics.

Researchers have found that adding fish oils to animal feed reduces the release of methane gas by 25 to 40 percent in sheep.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that traps nearly 20 times as much heat as carbon dioxide. Over 20 percent of global methane emissions come from farm animals.Gifts that keep on givingAlaskans will again reap the economic benefits from huge seafood harvests next year. Notably, the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) pollock fishery is back on track to handle a catch of 1.25 million metric tons (nearly three billion pounds). That is a 54% increase of over the past two years, but in line with the average catch of pollock sustained by the Bering Sea fishery for the past 30 years.In the Gulf of Alaska the pollock catch also was boosted by 13.5 percent  to  96,215 tons (13.7 million pounds). Together the BSAI and Gulf of Alaska pollock fisheries comprise the largest fishery in the U.S. and one of the biggest in the world.Similarly, Alaska provides much of the world’s codfish and 2011 catches got the nod for nice increases by fishery managers. In the Bering Sea, the harvest of half a billion pounds (228,000mt) of Pacific cod is a 35 percent increase. The Gulf quota of 65,100 mt (143 million pounds) is an increase of 9 percent.Sitka Sound will be home to an even bigger herring fishery next year. State managers peg the annual spring harvest at 19,490 tons, compared to 18,293 tons in 2010.  Biologists believe the Sitka Sound herring stock is at the highest level since the state began monitoring the stock in 1964.The big fish picture from ADF&G, 2010:Salmon corrections – A few corrections have been made to the Alaska Salmon Price Report which covers the crucial May-August sales season.  Number crunchers at The state Dept. of Revenue/Tax Division discovered some inadvertent “mislabeling” and “miss-categorizing” of salmon from one region of the state, according to market watcher Ken Talley.The amended numbers  show that the average price for frozen sockeye fillets was a whopping $5.06/lb this summer, not $3.62/lb. as was originally calculated.“This coincides more closely with anecdotal evidence at the time,” Talley said.It also shows that supply is a key ingredient in determining the price, he added.  Corrected figures show that sales of  frozen sockeye fillets were “more modest” at 7.4 million pounds,  instead of the 10.4 million pounds originally reported.Sales of frozen H&G (headed/gutted) chum salmon turned out to be 34.7 million pounds, or three million pounds higher than originally calculated. H&G remains the dominant product form for Alaska chum salmon.<COL>Sea yields unique products for technology<COL>2010-12-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/01/berring-snow-crab-fishermen-hope-for-patrols/<COL>Berring snow crab fishermen hope for patrolsby Laine WelchThe Bering Sea snow crab fishery has been stalled so far by bad weather. Most of the catch is delivered to St. Paul, where the Trident Seafood plant was awaiting supplies to get going.  A Northland barge has been stuck in Dutch Harbor due to weather, delaying operations.“We’re hoping for a clearing in the weather so the barge can get up there and we can get the season underway,” said Jake Jacobson, director of the Inter-Cooperative Exchange (ICE), which represents vessels holding 70 percent of the Bering Sea king and snow crab catch shares.When the fishery is underway, crabbers can plan on a nice payday. Most major buyers have agreed to an advance price almost a dollar higher than last season.“It’s usually 90 percent of what our expectations are for a final price after sales. So we’re expecting an advance price of $2.12 per pound,” Jacobson said.So far 18 crab boats are registered for the fishery, which is a ‘typical’ season start said biologist Jeanette Alas at ADF&G in Dutch Harbor.“A lot of boats will fish cod and when they are done they will trickle into the snow crab fishery,” Alas said.The 2011 snow crab catch quota is just over 54 million pounds, a 13% increase from 2010.Meanwhile, the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay ended a few weeks ago amidst little fanfare. Dock prices did indeed set a record – crabbers were advanced $6.25/lb, compared to $4.76/lb last year.“It’s a very strong market due to a decrease in supplies, primarily from Russia, and a very strong exchange rate with Japan,” Jacobson explained.He said some sales prices are still being finalized, but “the final price we received that can be made public right now is $7.44/lb for red king crab.”The portion of crab (13 percent) that is not locked in to certain processors and can be sold on the open market is fetching 37 cents over that, Jacobson said, bringing the final price to $7.81/lb.  The previous record price for red king crab was $6.27/lb set in 2002.Jacobson cautioned that the high crab prices are luring Russian pirates back to poaching millions of pounds of illegally caught, unreported king crab.   Bering Sea crabbers are launching an ‘ask for Alaska’ campaign so chefs, retailers and the public can be certain they are purchasing  crab that are caught legally from a well managed fishery.Halibut bait and bycatchBesides setting halibut catch limits, this month fishery managers also will take up several proposals for regulation changes.  Among them:    the Halibut Coalition is asking that specific limits be set for guided sport halibut harvests in Southeast Alaska.  Trident Seafoods is asking that regulations be modified to allow for possession of filleted halibut on board boats.  Now, even people living aboard a vessel are banned from having halibut fillets on board, even if they were purchased at a grocery store. Similarly, Coastal Island Charters is asking that overnight charter operators be able to cut up  and freeze halibut on board.Four research projects also are highlighted this year —  using new tagging technologies,  expanding halibut genetic work , and testing different baits during annual stock assessments.We have been using #2 semi-brite chum salmon since 1996, but now it’s just getting too expensive, said Bruce Leaman, director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission.“A lot of the salmon which was considered bait quality before are now being processed, particularly in overseas markets for human consumption,” Leaman told KDLG. “So we need to look at something that will give us a long-term guaranteed supply and a lower price. We are looking at testing pollock, pink salmon and herring against our standard chum bait next year.”The Commission also is refocusing more attention on halibut bycatch.  It’s estimated that 12 million pounds of halibut are taken as bycatch in other Pacific coast fisheries each year.   A halibut bycatch working group was formed to examine how those removals affect halibut stock assessments and fishery management.The recommended 2011 halibut catch limit for Alaska is 32.5 million pounds, down from 40 million pounds in 2010.  The IPHC meets January 25 – 29 in Vancouver.Aqua farm apps openEvery two years the state accepts applications for new aquatic farm sites, or farmers can choose pre-approved sites at any time.“Those are designated areas that have gone through preliminary review.  Other sites are pre-authorized,  maybe they have been opened at one time and then closed, those are available ‘over the counter’ as well,” said Cynthia Pring-Ham, mariculture coordinator for ADG&G which oversees  aquatic farm sites that are leased by the state Dept. of Natural Resources.There are  67 aquatic farms permitted in Alaska as of 2009, of which 25 are producing sales valued at just under a half million dollars. The farms are scattered throughout Southeast, Prince William Sound and Kachemak Bay near Homer. So far 93% are growing oysters, little neck clam production is at 5% and mussels at one percent. Other species of interest include various scallops, seaweeds and geoduck clams.“For oysters we are not even coming close to meeting the demands in Alaska and other markets,” Pring-Ham said.Major training programs are offered throughout the state by various growers and by Alaska Sea Grant to help people get started, and interest is definitely growing, Pring-Ham said. However, aquatic farming has yet to make headway in westward regions.“It is colder there and the environmental conditions with icing and extreme wave action don’t always make it conducive to the type of farming techniques we have established now in the state,” she said. “Not that it’s impossible, and there could be some other technology developed.”Pring-Ham added that the state, through its fish resource permitting process, can do mariculture site suitability projects if people want to invest some money to try it.Interested aqua farmers can apply for new sites through May 2nd.

Cash rewards of $500 are being offered to get the tags back so scientists can see how well they work.“This year the technology that everyone has been talking about for a decade but hasn’t been able to miniaturize are tags that record magnetic field strength on three axes and have accelerometers and pitch and roll detectors. Those were the lynch pins– without being able to tell whether or not your tag is horizontal, you can’t really get the axis of the magnetism. The invention of the iPhone and its advancements made the pitch and roll detectors small enough to put in fish tags,” said Dr. Tim Loher, a biologist with the International Pacific Halibut Commission.The IPHC oversees the health of the halibut stocks from California to British Columbia and the Bering Sea, and sets yearly catch limits for all fisheries.Loher said the iPhone has used “the rolling bead in the maze game” as an electronic component that  in real time is doing all the calculations ­­needed to horizontally calibrate a fish tag.“If you know the tag is horizontal you can get dip angle which is the angle at which the magnetism is entering the earth’s crust and that becomes steeper as you go to the poles.  That will hopefully give real time, daily positions on the fish and track them without any need for light, acoustics or communication with GPS satellites. All the information will be just be onboard when the fishermen catch them,” he explained.To field test the new technology this summer, 30 halibut were double tagged both inside and out and released in the Central Gulf and Southeast Alaska regions.“Almost all of the external tags either fall off or they will grow giant balls of fouling organisms and barnacles and mussels that eventually either kill the fish or screw up what the fish is doing. So what seems to work best is surgical implantation,” Loher said.The implanted geomagnetic tags have memory and battery life that records data every 30 seconds for seven years, meaning they could provide migration data from fish ‘adolescence’ into their breeding years.   If the geomagnetic field test works out, IPHC scientists aim to tag nearly 2,000 halibut  from Oregon to Attu and out to the US/ Russian border.  The goal is to build a better migration model to assist with fishery management.“We’ve got a lot of migration issues and we are trying to set our quotas and determine exactly how to assess the stock,” Loher said. “We know the fish are moving inshore to feed in the summer and offshore to spawn in the winter, but we are having trouble getting refined estimates of movement by size, age and regulatory area. Hopefully, this will help nail that down.”See tagged fish photos and get more info at www.iphc.washington.edu.Future seafood processors – There is lots of talk about the ‘graying of the fishing fleet’ and the same applies to seafood processing.“One of the big issues in the seafood industry is where the next generation of plant managers is coming from.  We are a graying institution,” said Chuck Crapo, a seafood specialist at the Fishery Industrial Technology Center in Kodiak.“You look at the plant managers in Alaska and many of them have been in their positions for 20-30 years and they are contemplating retirement. As an industry we have had a hard time finding and convincing some of the young promising people that working in the seafood industry is a good career choice.”To help turn the tide, Fish Tech will again host students of the Alaska Seafood Processor Leadership Institute this fall. The  program began in 2006 by Alaska  Sea Grant’s Marine Advisory Program to provide intensive professional development for plant supervisors, foremen or others working their way up in the processing industry.Classes begin with 10 days of technical immersion in Kodiak in October where the focus is on technical issues of operating a processing plant, such as   energy efficiency and lean management techniques.  Training moves to Anchorage in early spring where the focus shifts to leadership skills and project management. The program ends in mid-March with a trip to the  Boston Seafood Show to show how Alaska seafood plays in the  international scene.Nearly 30 students have gone through the ASPLI program so far and    most have remained in the seafood processing industry.“About 70% have remained,” Crapo said.  “I was just in Dutch Harbor and found out that one of our alumni is about to become the plant manager and Westward Seafoods.”ASPLI students must be sponsored by a seafood company, who pay a $3,000 tuition fee. The program provides the airfare, and room and board at the various training locations, and also has vocational training funds to help offset fees.“It is an opportunity for processing companies to provide an intensive, professional development experience for the up and coming, next generation  of managers,” Crapo said.Deadline to apply to the ASPLI training program is Sept. 15. www.seagrant.uaf.edu/mapFish watch – Alaska’s salmon season is on the home stretch but other fisheries are just getting underway.  Pollock fishing reopened around Kodiak on August  25 and  that fishery was expected to deliver 42 million pounds of pollock in a matter of days.  The fleet and local processors are partnering to donate all bycatch to food banks…. The Gulf also reopens to Pacific cod on September 1. … Alaska longliners have about 8 million pounds remaining in the 30 million pound halibut catch limit. The golden king crab season got underway August 15 the in the Bering Sea, the same day that the summer Dungeness crab fishery ended in Southeast Alaska. Early reports indicate a so-so catch of about two million pounds. The crab fetched higher prices – $2.20, up 60 cents from last year.  The Southeast crab will compete against the bumper catch that just wrapped up in Oregon, where for the fifth time in 10 years, Dungeness landings topped 20 million pounds.Get on yer fish soap box!

At a glance:   62 percent of all U.S. seafood landings come from Alaska … 96 percent of all wild- caught salmon come from Alaska …  Seafood is by far Alaska’s #1 export, valued at nearly $2 billion (next in line:  zinc and lead at $785 million) … Alaska ranks 9th  in the world in terms of global seafood production.The seafood industry is second only to Big Oil in revenues it generates to Alaska’s general fund each year. The industry provides more Alaska jobs than oil/gas, mining, tourism and timber combined.Here are some fishing notables from 2010, in no particular order, followed by my annual ‘fish picks and pans’:The University of Alaska created a center devoted entirely to ocean acidification studies. Meanwhile, acid levels in the Gulf of Alaska and the Chukchi and Bering Seas continued to increase faster and more severely than previously thought.?   Catch share programs became the preferred tool for managing U.S. fisheries. Federal managers budgeted $54 million as ‘incentive’ for catch shares to catch on in fishing regions.The North Pacific Council approved sweeping changes to its fishery observer program that will include all vessels longer than 40 feet.Alaska’s biggest fishery  rebounded on schedule to accommodate a 2011 pollock catch of nearly three billion pounds, a 54 percent increase over the past two years (but in line with the average catch for the past 30 years.)Kodiak and Sitka were the latest fishing towns to add some local catch to their school lunch menus, following Dillingham, Kenai, Fairbanks and Mat-Su.The Chuitna coal mine project set its stakes (literally) on setnet lease sites in Upper Cook Inlet. The sites would make way for a 2-mile dock to shuttle coal to ships.Halibut prices seldom dipped below $5 per pound, boosting the value of the fishery to $193 million, an increase of $61 million over 2009.Halibut catches continued a downward trend and managers plan to trim the harvest again in 2011.   Halibut catches in Southeast Alaska have dropped by more than 60 percent over the past five years.Alaska salmon fishermen were paid an average of $.66 per pound this year, a 16 percent increase over 2009.The 2010 catch of 169 million salmon was the 11th largest on record. The dockside value of almost $534 million was an increase of nearly 30 percent and the best showing in 18 years.Two areas, Bristol Bay and Prince William Sound, accounted for 55 percent of the value of the total Alaska catch.Prince William Sound set a record with a total catch of 75.4 million –nearly 45 percent of all salmon harvested in Alaska this year! The PWS harvest of 69 million humpies accounted for 66 percent of Alaska’s total pink salmon catch.Norton Sound fishermen saw some of the best chum salmon runs in 25 years. At Kotzebue, the chum catches tracked the best in 15 years.  Upper Cook Inlet fishermen hauled in a huge 2.7 million sockeye harvest, almost a million more fish than expected. King salmon continued to decline on the Yukon River.A surprise pink salmon fishery at Bristol Bay (Nushagak) attracted 60 boats and 35 setnetters who pulled in over one million humpies along with 60,000 cohos.  It’s been so long since a pink and coho salmon fishery occurred, managers had no numbers to compare the catches to.Peter Pan Seafoods and Bristol Bay fishermen were recognized by Alaska Head Start Association for providing local salmon to children and elders throughout Southwest Alaska.Frankenfish!  After a decade of debate, the Food and Drug Administration officially proposed regulations to allow genetically modified animals for human consumption.  First up: a salmon that grows up to 30 times faster than normal.  Alaska Senators said they will try and stop the fish from ever getting to market.Salmon “e-tenders” field tested a new system that computes the number of fish delivered, weights, species, then prints out a fish ticket and tally sheet.It turns out that the deadliest catch is the safest catch. A federal report showed that  salmon fishing is Alaska’s most dangerous fishery with 39 fatalities over the past decade.  That compares to a death toll of 12 Bering Sea crabbers during the same time.For the 21st year in a row Dutch Harbor ranked as the nation’s #1 port for seafood landings.  Kodiak ranked #4, up from the #5 spot.  Eleven Alaska fishing towns made the list of top 50 U.S. ports.Americans ate slightly less seafood – 15.8 pounds per person, the lowest level since 2002.  Beef is still what’s for dinner: 108 pounds per capita, followed by   73 pounds of poultry.Alaska king crab also fetched some of the highest prices ever. Bering Sea crabbers got an advance of $6.25 a pound, compared to $4.76/lb last yearHigher fish prices drove up both the demand and value for fishing permits and IFQs/catch shares in most regions of the state.The story of Yukon River salmon claimed a food Oscar from the James Beard Foundation as part of a PBS series called “Chefs A’ Field.”Anchorage and the Mat-Su Valley became home to 1,744 fishing permit holders – the most in Alaska.Amidst much controversy, federal managers closed huge fishing regions to allegedly protect sea lions in the western Aleutians.  Economic losses to the cod and Atka mackerel fisheries are estimated at $200 million a year.President Obama withdrew offshore oil and gas leases for Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering Sea, at least until 2017. The area encompasses 5.6 million acres of   fishing grounds that supply more than 40% of the total U.S. seafood harvest.Two hundred Alaska fishermen field tested PFDs (personal flotation devices) as part of a national study and rated the Mustang inflatable PFD the highest.The two year project to collect labor data on Alaska deckhands imploded when concerns by United Fishermen of Alaska stopped it from advancing to state lawmakers. At issue: skippers, not crew, would be tasked with all the paperwork.All of Alaska’s cod fisheries merited an eco-label from the international Marine Stewardship Council.Alaska’s sustainable fishery resources remained the envy of all other seafood producing nations.

The petition, by the Chuitna Citizens Coalition and Cook Inletkeeper asked that buffer zones be required to protect salmon streams of the Chuitna River should a coal mine be built. In a 109-page report, Dept. of Natural Resources commissioner Dan Sullivan claimed the petitioners’ request would ‘ban all surface coal mining on these lands.’The Chuitna strip mine, so called because it removes wetlands and land overlay, would be the largest coal mine in Alaska.  Plans by developer PacRim of Delaware call for removal of 11 miles of Middle Creek, an important salmon spawning stream.   PacRim claims it will be able to restore the stream after 25 years of strip mining. DNR’s Sullivan said he agrees such reclamation of areas affected by strip coal mining is possible.Deputy DNR Commissioner Ed Fogels said the citizens’ petition would have called a halt to the permitting process.“We decided there is simply not enough evidence to say there is no way you can reclaim the land, and we were not about to pull the plug on this thorough environmental impact process. And that is the appropriate place to make these decisions as to whether reclamation can be done properly and in accordance with the law,” he told APRN.United Fishermen of Alaska, the nation’s largest commercial fishing trade group, was disappointed with the DNR petition denial.“UFA has commented in opposition to the mine and in support of the petition for unsuitable lands, and we remain skeptical of the idea that large sections of salmon streams hosting five species of salmon could be removed and then successfully replaced,” said Mark Vinsel, UFA director.DNR’s Ed Fogels said an environmental impact statement should be out for public review in about nine months, and  final decisions will be made only after a new round of public meetings is held.“No way is this petition decision giving the green light to the mine. We still have a long way to go,” Fogels said.Meanwhile, Cook Inletkeeper’s Bob Shavelson cautions that permitting the Chuitna mine will set a dangerous precedent.“Because it is going to be the first time in state history that we are going to mine through 11 miles of a salmon stream. If they can do it here in Cook Inlet, they are going to be able to do it anywhere in the state,” Shavelson said. “Gov. Parnell has said repeatedly that he would not trade one resource for another. He has gone back on that promise to Alaskans.”Crab dipKodiak crabbers were disappointed when catches below one million pounds were announced for the Tanner crab fishery that starts in January.  For several years Tanners have been trending upwards due to strong year classes recruiting into the fishery. Kodiak’s take last season was 1.4 million pounds, and crabbers and fishery managers anticipated a higher harvest for 2012. But annual trawl surveys showed a turn around.“During the fishery we heard reports of a fair number of crab that were just under legal size, and we saw those same crab in the survey. The expectation was that they would molt and be available for this next year’s fishery, but that crab didn’t materialize. It was a little unexpected,” said Nick Sagalkin, a fishery manager at ADF&G in Kodiak.Sagalkin said the lack of legal crab (only mature male crabs of about two and a half pounds can be retained for market) was fairly widespread.“We saw it throughout the  Kodiak area, along the Alaska Peninsula and at Chignik. So whatever happened, it occurred throughout the Gulf,” he added.In all, the Westward fisheries will yield about 3.3 million pounds of Tanner crab, down by more one million pounds from last season.The Kodiak district crab harvest is 900,000 pounds. The Alaska Peninsula fisheries also took a cut to 1.6 million pounds, down from 2.3 million. At Chignik, Tanner catches got a slight boost to 700,000 pounds.   Last season 70 boats dropped pots for Tanners around Kodiak, 53 at the Alaska Peninsula and 16 at Chignik. Crab prices averaged $2.40-$2.50 a pound at the docks, and are likely to be higher in 2012.Fast crabCrabbers took more than half of the 7.8 million pound red king crab harvest in the first 10 days of the Bristol Bay fishery.  The base price is a record at $9/lb and will go higher pending post season sales adjustments.Salmon sales sizzle – Wild salmon was a hot commodity all summer.  Alaska’s total salmon catch of 172 million fish was 2% higher than 2010, but the first wholesale value (not including roe) topped $540 million, an increase of more than 5%.   The Alaska Department of Revenue’s latest Salmon Price Report covers sales volumes and prices for the busy May-September sales season.  Market expert Ken Talley provided a snapshot of trends and highlights during that four months:Salmon sellers made a big push to get fresh fish to customers this summer and gained a nearly 10% market share, while frozen sales tumbled by more than 7%.  For headed and gutted salmon, the industry mainstay, fresh production increased nearly 6%  while the frozen H&G salmon pack dipped by 9.5%.Customer-friendly salmon fillets continued to make big gains -Alaska production was up nearly 26% and approached 20 million pounds.  Over 6 million pounds of salmon fillets went out fresh this summer, a gain of more than 30 %.Alaska Chinook salmon saw a big average price jump to $10.76/lb. for fresh fillets this summer, on reduced production of just 32,000 pounds.  Fresh also was the name of the game for coho salmon. Wholesale prices increased from $3.02/lb. to $3.40/lb. for fresh H&G cohos on a nearly 40% drop in volume.Talley said for the first time in recent memory, fresh and frozen pink salmon wholesaled for virtually the same price this summer, both at about $1.45/lb.Chums saw gains in prices for  fresh and frozen H&G, along with fresh fillets, while prices for frozen fillets fell as volume went up.For sockeye salmon, fresh prices for both H&G and fillets dropped slightly this summer on higher output of those products. Sales of frozen fish over coming months will be important to watch.Fewer than 30,000 cases of canned sockeye were put up this summer, down more than 63% from last year. That pushed prices to a whopping $151 per case of talls, compared to $113 last summer.  For pinks, case prices dropped slightly to about $78, on gains of nearly half a million cases of canned pinks, a 62 increase in production.Get Smart Gear!The international Smart Gear competition rewards new gear ideas that help fishermen retain their target catches while letting marine mammals, turtles, birds or small fish swim away. The contest, which began in 2005 by the World Wildlife Fund, set a record this year.“We received 74 entries, the second highest number,  (80 in 2006)  but from 31 different countries, and that is the highest we have ever had,” said Mike Osmond, WWF project director.The competition attracted one entry from Alaska.“ It did quite well, I can tell you that, but that is all I can say at the moment,” Osmond said.The bi-annual Smart Gear competition awards cash prizes to three winners: a $30,000 grand prize; two runners up prizes of $10,000 each, and a regional $7,500 award for gear that reduces tuna bycatch.Long after the contest ends, WWF continues to work with the innovators to get their gears out on the fishing grounds.“At present around 45% of the ideas are out there on the water,” Osmond said.The 2009 winning gear from Australia was a stern mounted, underwater baited hook that reduces seabird bycatch. And, because it minimizes drag, it is the most fuel-efficient method of delivering baited hooks at required depths.In 2007, Rhode Island’s “Eliminator” took home the top prize – it is a high rise modified trawl net that takes advantage of fish behavior to allow cod bycatch to escape.“That has been adopted by quite a number of  fishermen on the east coast, and a modification of the net is being used successfully in the United Kingdom,” Osmond said.Another gear – the Flexi-grid from the Faroe Islands – targets bycatch in blue whiting fisheries. Its use has become mandatory by the Faroese government and the gear is now also used in Russia and Iceland.Smart Gear winners will be announced November 17 at Pacific Marine Expo in Seattle.www.smartgear.org.<COL>Permitting PacRim Coal sets bad precedent<COL>2011-11-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/01/alaska-fishermens-wives-get-own-reality-show/<COL>Alaska fishermen’s wives get own reality showBy Laine WelchA casting call is out for Alaska women to star in an Animal Planet reality show.“The name of the show we are casting is Alaska Fishermen’s Wives,” said Annette Ivy, casting producer with Shed Media US in Los Angeles. “We are looking for a kind of flip side of Deadliest Catch, and that would be the fishermen’s wives and their lifestyle. We’re interested in the stresses and challenges they go through when their husbands are out at sea and they’re left holding down the fort.”“People are interested in seeing other lifestyles,” Ivy added.  “Do these women fish and hunt? What do they do for fun?  We want to peek into their lifestyles because it really is very unique. We are very excited.”Ivy said producers are seeking a “community” of 5 – 6 women who live near each other and are friends. Coast Guard wives whose husbands are on fisheries patrols for long periods also fit the casting profile.“We want a lively bunch, big personalities, very talkative and outgoing and outspoken,” she said.Ivy said the casting call is “now” and they hope to cast the program “in a few weeks.”Contact Annette Ivy at 323-904-4680 Ext. 1061, or Ext. 1206 for Mark Neal.  Email a photo and short bio to aivy@shedmediaus.com or mneal@shedmediaus.com. Interviews can be done by phone.Good grades in the Bay – Bristol Bay salmon fishermen got good report cards for boosting the quality of their fish.For the past two summers, a group of 15 driftnet fishermen at Egegik participated in a project that graded portions of the salmon catch they delivered to processors. The fish was headed and gutted and graded by plant standards to see how much, or if, their quality scores improved.The results?“The percentage of No. 1 quality fish went from 43 percent in 2009 to 69 percent  in 2010. That’s a huge jump,” said project director Mark Buckley, a 23-year Bay fisherman and owner/operator Digital Observer, Inc.That jump in quality translated to a nice price boost.“Comparing 2009 with 2010, the average value of the fish  we studied rose 18 cents a pound.  Just by improving the quality,” Buckley said.The fishermen were provided with simple tips to improve their handling practices out on the water, such as lowering brailler weights, or using a Salmon Slide to reduce wear and tear on the fish. In follow up questionnaires, Buckley fishermen unanimously supported the report card incentive and the handling quality tips they received. The program will be expanded throughout Bristol Bay this summer.Buckley said he believes the Bristol Bay salmon fishery has reached a turning point for the better, and he credits the Bay’s Regional Seafood Development Association for leading the way.“If they weren’t funding this work, no one else would be. This is motivated and driven by the fishermen themselves with the interest in improving their bottom lines through common sense methods of improving quality,” he said. Some project funding also came from federal grants.Buckley added that he will continue to advocate for fishermen to be rewarded for the quality of salmon they deliver.“Everybody would get the same grounds price at the end of the season. After all the sales are made and the company knows how much it’s going to split up among everybody, let’s pay some guys a little bit more than others,” Buckley said. “It doesn’t cost the company any more and everybody gets a bonus, but some guys get more because of the quality of their fish.”Tanner time!  Crabbers at Kodiak, Chignik and the Alaska Peninsula had buyers bidding for their catches even before they left the docks (weather permitting) on Jan. 15.  The region wide quota of 4.4 million pounds is nearly tripled from last year, thanks to a big year class of  crabs recruiting into the fishery.The newly molted crabs are ‘big and beautiful,’ according to local biologists, and average weights are likely to approach 2.5 pounds, compared to 2.2 last year. The local bairdi Tanner crabs are the larger cousins of snow crab, and right now, it’s just what the market is looking for.“I would not be surprised to see the guys in Kodiak get record prices this year, the same way there has been a record price in king crab earlier this fall,” said John Sackton, a crab market expert and editor of Seafood.com.Sackton said the crab market remains “very short” and a lot of big buyers are not backing away from the higher prices.“As a result you have a lot of heavy weights slugging it out to get access to crab,” he continued. “That’s what’s making the crab market so crazy right now. No one is backing down.“The Japanese have a 30-40 percent currency advantage and they also are trying to ramp up their crab supplies, and you have the large U.S. users still bidding for it because it is too popular to take out of their product line. So when you get both of those forces bidding against each other, you have the recipe for record prices, and that’s what we are seeing right now.”A fleet of 63 boats was signed on for the Kodiak fishery, 46 boats for two Peninsula districts and 12 at Chignik. The advance price to crab fishermen was reportedly $2.50 per pound.Hearing on coal buffers – Grass roots groups in Upper Cook Inlet are asking the state to set up buffer zones to protect the Chuit River and its tributaries from coal mining.  Chuitna Citizens and Cook Inletkeeper filed an Unsuitable Lands Petition with the Department of Natural Resources that is set for one public hearing in Kenai on Wednesday.“The petition does not preclude mining or stop the mine,” said Dennis Gann, a spokesman for Cook Inletkeeper. “It sets up a buffer zone on the river and tributaries, similar to logging companies, where they couldn’t mine within 100 feet of tributaries and 150 feet from the main stem of the river. It’s basically the same buffer we see with logging companies today. We think it is a reasonable request. If a salmon stream isn’t an unsuitable area for coal mining, then what is?”The petition is not a referendum on the Chuitna coal mine, Gann added, “It’s about protecting the river and the salmon for future generations.”The Chuitna coal mine project being developed by PacRim Coal of Delaware is located 45 miles west of Anchorage. It hopes to extract over one billion tons of sub bituminous coal from 32 square miles of the Chuitna Watershed for export to Asia.Comments on the Unsuitable Lands Petition also can be sent via email to russell.kirkham@alaska.gov<COL>Alaska fishermen’s wives get own reality show<COL>2011-01-19<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/03/safety-programs-canceled-due-to-slashed-budget/<COL>Safety programs canceled due to slashed budgetBy Laine WelchThe nation’s most dangerous job could soon become more deadly. As Congress struggles to balance current and future budgets, fishing safety programs are on the cutting room floor.The president’s FY2012 budget eliminates funding ($23 million) for all agriculture, forestry and fishing research (AgFF) done by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health , and it is likely to be trimmed from the FY11 budget being debated now.“That means current fishing research would stop,” said Jennifer Lincoln, an Injury Epidemiologist with the Commercial Fishing Research and Design Program based in Anchorage.   Funds for the fishing program  are about $1.5 million, she added.? NIOSH is not a regulatory agency, but a research organization established in 1970 to improve the safety and health of US workers.  Today, NIOSH is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.  Lincoln said there is a core group of 6 people who work within the fishing industry component of research.In Alaska, NIOSH teams have created E-Stops, a simple system that prevents fishermen from becoming entangled in capstan winches, cited as the most dangerous piece of equipment on deck. Two manufacturers have pledged that all new winches will come with E-Stops installed.In another study, over 200 Alaska fishermen tested different styles of PFDs  (personal flotation devices) for a month during diverse fisheries, and rated the two they liked best. NIOSH is now working with manufacturers to include the fishermen’s recommendations in new PFDs.NIOSH engineers also have partnered with Trident Seafoods and American Seafoods to develop a watertight hatch and door  system that can be monitored from the wheelhouse.  A low cost tank monitoring system also is under development. Most recently the NIOSH team discovered that Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishermen have the highest fatality rate than any other US fishery, due to men lost overboard. Lincoln will meet with shrimpers next month to find solutions.If fishing industry research is cut from the budget, it would pull the plug on the Commercial Fishing Incident Data Base (CFID) that covers deaths and vessel losses for the entire country from 2000 through 2010.“That data will be used to develop new safety compliance regulations that in a few years will be required for fishing vessels older than 25 years,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska. “We are concerned that the new rules will be based on outdated information.” A 2006 NIOSH review by the National Academies review separated the fishing program and called it ‘exemplary.’  The report said “the NIOSH Alaska Field Station has executed its research according to how an ideal program would operate.”‘But’s back!March 12 marked the start of halibut fisheries in Alaska, British Columbia and the Pacific coast states.  The coast wide catch limit of 41 million pounds is down 19 percent from last year. Alaska’s share of the catch is 32.5 million pounds, a drop of nearly 10 million pounds from last year.The huge shortfall in supply has buyers scrambling for the popular fish – and they are prepared to pay for it. Talk on the dock a few days before the fishery pegged first deliveries at $6.50- $7.25 a pound, but no one was talking prior to the fishery.  Said one big Kodiak buyer:  Nobody wants to be the first to set a price, because everyone else will top it.   The average statewide dock price for halibut last year was $4.86 per pound up almost 57 percent from the previous year.Market watchers predict halibut prices are nearing a ceiling. Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley said the tale will be told at white tablecloth restaurants, where most of the fresh halibut goes. Only small amounts of frozen holdovers from 2010 are available going into the new season, he said.Just over 2,100 quota share holders make up Alaska’s halibut longline fleet.   Homer is always the top port for landings and can always pay the best prices, due to its road access.  Kodiak or Seward rank second, followed by ports in Southeast. Dutch Harbor also ranks as one of Alaska’s top halibut spots. In fact, the largest halibut ever caught at 459 pounds was taken from Unalaska Bay. The halibut fishery ends Nov. 18.Fishing 101Nothing can replace all the lessons learned on deck – but it wouldn’t hurt to have a little advance training, especially as fishing jobs become more competitive.  Alaska Sea Grant is floating the idea of a professional fisherman’s training program designed to prepare recruits in coastal Alaska for the fishing jobs of the future. An online survey is gathering input from the industry.“Do you think it would be important to have classes on marine safety, navigation, seamanship, vessel maintenance, engine repair, understanding regulatory processes, gear specific production techniques, business planning, financing and management. All of these subjects and more are on the slate to see if it actually makes sense,” said Glenn Haight, Fishing Business Specialist in Juneau.He estimates the fishing course would include up to 15 classes for one year, and be tailored to individual needs.  The course would provide an “occupational endorsement”  to those who complete the training.  Haight said the survey also asks if the   training endorsement would be a  valuable asset to skippers when making decisions about hiring crew.Find the survey at   www.surveymonkey.com/s/CommercialFishingTrainingProgram  or www.alaskaseagrant.org.Trident rocksThe Hard Rock restaurant chain named Trident Seafoods as its Culinary Partner of the Year for 2011.

The herring are valued for their eggs, and harvesters get paid according to the amount of roe in the fish.The Sitka Sound harvest could approach 19,500 thousand tons for the fishery’s 50 permit holders. Last year after price adjustments they got $690 per ton for their catches, making the fishery worth over $12 million at the docks, far more than halibut or black cod.The Bristol Bay roe herring fishery at Togiak was worth about $4 million to seiners and setnetters in 2010, and over $2 million at Kodiak.But virtually all of the roe herring goes to one buyer: Japan. In fact, Japan is Alaska’s No. 1 customer for all its seafood; Japan imports more seafood than any other nation in the world.The northeast coast of Japan hardest hit by the horrific quake and tsunami is home to the bulk of Japan’s seafood industry, for both fishing and processing – especially roe products.“You have to look at this on a species specific level,” said John Sackton, editor of www.seafood.com.  “And for us we have black cod, crab, herring roe, salmon roe, Bristol Bay salmon, pollock and cod.  The real question is what’s happening in those species, and to what extent have the Japanese been driving the market.“You can rank them and say that the Japanese drive the market for herring roe and pollock roe,’ Sackton continued. “After that they drive the market for crab, and their approach to surimi has an impact on the pollock market. But when you get down to fish like Alaska salmon, and black cod, the Japanese are not really the market leaders anymore. There are plenty of other buyers who will step in and purchase those products.”Sackton said the “buying psychology” might shift as the Japanese focus on rebuilding.“It could be both the buyers and Japanese consumers don’t feel this is a time to focus on luxury goods and they want to put their resources elsewhere,” he said. Sackton and other experts said impacts on seafood trade are too soon to tell, and that this week’s International Boston Seafood Show will “tell the tale.”Meanwhile, fish prices are the last thing on people’s minds in Japan’s fishing towns.Japan is a huge fishing nation in its own right, and an estimated 6,000 fishing vessels, 1,100 seafood facilities, 40,000 workers and 40,000 fishermen lost their livelihoods, according to the Japan Blog by Intrafish.The  blog said seafood production plants are either gone or buried, and the coastal towns are piled high with rotting fish from the washed out plants and cold storages. The region’s fishing grounds also have been polluted by debris from buildings and concrete pulled into the sea when the tsunami waves retreatedWhile damages to big Japanese corporations like Sony and Honda are grabbing the headlines, the the brunt of the destruction was borne by small coastal businesses, fishing fleets and seafood processors, says a powerful Wall Street  Journal article called “Fishing Town Suffers, Caught in Waves’ Wake.”  It’s a shocker because it could be us. www.onlinewsj.com.Chillin’ in the Bay – Improving fish quality was the driving goal of Bristol Bay fishermen when they formed a Regional Seafood Development Association (RSDA) five years ago. Each year more than 1,800 drift netters pay a 1% tax on their salmon catches to support the effort, which is yielding over $1 million a year. The BBRSDA has put its money primarily into ice.An annual survey of Bay processors by Northern Economics/Anchorage shows the percentage of chilled salmon deliveries nearly doubled from 2008 to 2010, from 24% to 47%.  The better quality meant more Bristol Bay salmon were turned into frozen or fillet products, instead of lower valued cans. Last summer 33% went into the can compared to 46% in 2008.Many Bristol Bay processors provide ice to their fleets, and ice barges and ice machines are placed strategically in the Bay, said Bob Waldrop, BBRSDA director.“We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of pounds of fish chilled by ice, from about 6 million in 2008 to 17 million pounds last year. That’s nearly tripled,” Waldrop said.Overall, chilled fish made up 41% of the total Bristol Bay salmon catch; with unchilled fish at 59%. That’s down from 64% in 2009. The drift net fleet provided about 90% of the chilled fish.Other findings:  Fishermen had 155 tons of daily ice production by processors, 23%  of total ice produced. That’s almost twice last year, and is an increase of 66 tons per day.The amount of salmon processed outside Bristol Bay continues to decline, down from 16.8 percent in 2008, to 7.2 percent in 2009, to 2.1 percent in 2010.

And prices in 2011 show nice increases so far, nearly across the board.In its Annual Salmon Price Report (ASPR) the state Revenue Department/Tax Division provides average wholesale prices for salmon as it sells throughout the year. The report is broken down by Alaska region and covers six product forms: canned, fresh/frozen whole, fresh/frozen fillets and roe. The reports are compiled from prices submitted by processors that sold at least one million pounds at wholesale. The ASPR covering sales from January through April show that prices were up substantially in almost every salmon categoryBy far, most of Alaska’s salmon pack goes out as H&G frozen, and Chinook averaged $4.12/lb, compared to $3.31 last year. Frozen sockeye averaged $3, an increase of 17 cents per pound. For chums, an average of $1.78 is an increase of 41 cents. No frozen pink sales were listed through April; in 2010 the pink average was 91 cents a pound.  The only decrease in frozen H&G salmon was coho salmon, which averaged $2.37, down from $2.49 during the same time in 2010.Frozen salmon fillets also showed nice price increases through April, with Chinook fillets fetching $8.75 a pound, up from $2.40.    Sockeye fillets wholesaled at $6.29, compared to $5.18. Cohos averaged $5.13 a pound, up from $4.61; Pink fillets were at $2.69 a pound, and frozen chum fillets averaged $3.34, an increase of 91 cents from the same time last year.The only other drop in price through April was for fresh H&G Chinook –$9.23 a pound, compared to $10.11during the first four months of last year.Canned salmon, which make up the second largest part of the annual pack, also showed strong price gains. For cases of ‘talls’ (14.75oz, 48 cans), canned sockeye averaged $144.88, up from $113.64; canned pinks were at $78.60, compared to $77.81; canned chum salmon averaged $66.27per case, compared to  $55.60 last year. Sales of canned coho salmon also made the 2011 list, averaging $89.66 per case.Wholesale prices also increased for canned ‘halves’ (7.5oz): cases of canned sockeye salmon sold for $78.71, compared to $67.31; and canned pinks averaged $47.22, up from $45.39.Some of the biggest wholesale price increases through April were for salmon roe. Sockeye roe was listed at $7.01 per pound, compared to $2.07 for the same time last year. Coho roe averaged $6.87, up from $4.87/lb. The price for pink salmon roe nearly tripled at $9.94, compared to $3.78 last year. Chum roe jumped to $13.62 per pound, up from $10.50.Find the complete ASPR atwww.tax.alaska.gov.Poached crab anyone?Bids are being accepted by the federal government through July 19 on 248,144 pounds of illegally caught king crab taken in Russian waters. The crab was seized via NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, which is selling the lot to the highest bidder.If it is illegal, how can it be sold? is the question buzzing through the industry.“The Food & Drug Administration does not resell rejected product; the US doesn’t sell seized drugs. We think NOAA should explain the rationale for selling ‘illegal’ fish,” wrote John Sackton, editor of Seafood.com.  “The auction sale will put more king crab into a very tight market, possibly penalizing legitimate sales.”“It doesn’t make sense,” posted an anonymous seafood importer. “The U.S. government seizes (allegedly) illegally caught king crab and then puts it up for auction for the marketplace …worldwide. And that means, it seems to me, that our government is a participant to the sale of contraband ‘downstream’ to food businesses and thereafter to the consumers?”Industry veteran Robert George said the crab should be donated to “food banks, charities and people who suffered disasters the past few months.” He added:  “So now our government is getting into the seafood business,” posted. “How can they seize illegal crab from Russia and then sell it in the U.S.? I think the entire U.S. seafood industry, especially the Alaskan crab industry, should be outraged!!”Jim Stone, a longtime Bering Sea crab fisherman, called the government auction “lunacy,” adding:  “This crab has a value close to 2.5% of the US king crab catch, and now our product must compete with seized crab?  We applaud the US and other governments for the crackdowns on IUU (illegal, unregulated, unreported) crab and other fisheries, but to see it sold after confiscation seems like a counter-productive way to help the negative effects on our crab market.”Scallop fishing againOne of the world’s most delectable seafood delicacies is scallops, and the biggest and best come from Alaska.  Each July a fleet of just three to four boats fish for weathervane scallops in waters ranging from Yakutat to the Bering Sea, with most of the catch coming from around Kodiak.Weathervanes are the largest scallops in the world, with a shell diameter averaging ten inches.  Scallop boats drop big dredges that make tows along mostly sandy bottoms of strictly defined fishing regions. The fishery is closely monitored by onboard observers, at a cost to the boats up to $400 per day.“We accept that in order to go into the areas and make sure our bycatch and impact are minimal,” said boat owner Jim Stone.The boats catch, process, package and freeze the ‘meats’ at sea (the muscle that holds the shells together), and can remain out until Thanksgiving.  Scallops are wildly popular in the U.S. and Europe and can pay fishermen $7 to $8/lb or more.State managers keep a close eye on the stocks, and Alaska catches have held steady at about half a million pounds for many years. Compare that to East Coast catches that can top 50 million pound of shucked meats a year.Bring ‘em back alive – The man overboard  video is now live on the NIOSH YouTube channel. Find it athttp://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-126d/<COL>Salmon wholesale prices mostly good to fair<COL>2011-07-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/05/humpies-top-projections-kings-keep-fingers-crossed/<COL>Humpies top projections; kings – keep fingers crossedby Laine WelchAlaska’s 2011 salmon season officially gets underway in two weeks.While trollers in Southeast Alaska provide Chinook salmon to markets nearly year round (their spring fishery got under way April 25),  it is the runs of reds and kings to the famous Copper River that mark the official start of Alaska’s salmon season. State managers have announced May 16 as the first opener there, three days later than last year.The Copper River forecast calls for a catch of 1.2 million sockeye salmon, 9,000 kings and 293,000 cohos this season. Fingers are crossed that the catch will come in on target, unlike last year when Copper River salmon catches were well below the 10 year averages.  Sockeyes, for example, yielded a harvest of  636,000 fish, about half of what was expected.Overall, last year’s statewide salmon catch of 171 million fish was valued at $534 million at the Alaska docks, the best showing in 18 years. (And that doesn’t include bonuses or other post-season price adjustments.) State managers predict even better salmon catches this year – nearly 204 million fish. If the catch comes in on target, it will be the fifth largest salmon harvest on record.The boost stems from a projected pink catch topping 133 million fish, about 25 percent higher than last year. All major pink salmon regions – Prince William Sound, Kodiak and Southeast – are expected to produce abundant humpy harvests.Projected catches are up for the other salmon species as well:  sockeye, the big money fish, is pegged at nearly 45 million; the coho catch is set at 4.6 million, and for chums a harvest of nearly 20 million would be the fifth best since 1960.  For king salmon, a catch just shy of 122,000 is expected in areas outside of Southeast Alaska, where a treaty with Canada dictates the amount of Chinook that can be taken. The Southeast Chinook catch for all users is pegged at just under 295,000 fish, 73,000 more than last year.Here’s a look at the statewide average dock prices per pound for 2010, with comparisons to 2009 prices, in parentheses:   Chinook salmon – $3.44 ($2.76);  sockeye  – $1.11 is (90 cents);  coho – $1.05  (93 cents); pink salmon – 35 cents (26 cents);   chums –  66 cents (49 cents).Last year all Alaska regions except for Kodiak and the Alaska Peninsula saw increased values for their total salmon catches. Kodiak dropped from $39 million to around $28 million; the Alaska Peninsula went from $31 million to about $23 million in salmon values.Lobster balls – Innovators at the University of Maine are turning tons of discarded, ground up lobster shells into biodegradable golf balls.“It gives the correct density for the core and the golf ball overall, and it’s pretty easy to work with as well so that’s an added bonus,” said Alex Caddell,  a bio-engineering student who developed the lobster golf ball with his professor, David Neivandt.Caddell, an avid golfer, said in trials the lobster balls yield 70-80 percent of the distance of regular models. But they are as good, if not better, than other biodegradables on the market with one big advantage.“It can be hit with both an iron and a driver,” Caddell explained in a phone interview. “It can withstand the impact of a driver without damaging it as some other biodegradable balls do.”Another big advantage – the raw materials for the lobster golf balls cost about 19 cents, compared to a dollar a pop for other biodegradables.  Caddell said the lobster golf balls, which dissolve in about three weeks,  are good for driving ranges close to water  – but the main market is cruise ships.“They used to allow regular golf balls to be hit off the back of cruise ships until the dumping of plastics was banned in 1999. So hopefully that is  where we would get most of our customers,” he said.It is a trade secret how they actually use the lobster shells, and the creators have applied for a provisional patent which allows them to release the news to the press and still retain rights to the product.The next step, Caddell said, is to ramp up production and make sure the lobster golf balls can be reproduced on a larger scale. He added that they hope to obtain other filler materials – “like crab shells which likely have the same properties we are looking for.”Ideally, the team hopes to have the lobster balls available in a year or so.“Hopefully, we can find some companies that are interested both on the production and ownership side and who want to market it for us,” Caddell said. “We are really open to anything.Besides the market potential of the biodegradable golf balls, a main goal of the project is to help keep tonnage out of local landfills and to help lobstermen add value to their catches.The ground up lobster shells also are being turned into biodegradable plant pots. And other Maine entrepreneurs are using shells of lobsters, scallops, clams and mussels mixed with recycled glass to create high end tiles and tabletops.Fish bucks bucked – For nearly 50 years a multimillion dollar fund to promote and market U.S. seafood has been largely ignored. The money, mandated by the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act of 1954, comes from a 30 percent tariff paid to the U.S. Customs Service on imported seafood and ocean products.  Congress mandated the money be spent on “improved technology, quality improvements, domestic and foreign market development and other uses for the U.S. seafood industry.”But, according to the Congressional Research Service, only token dollars have gone towards the fishing industry. Instead, 80 to 90 percent each year has gone to NOAA operations, research and facilities.“Get over it,” said Bruce Schactler of Kodiak, a global marketing expert for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute and national chair for United Fishermen of Alaska.  “We wish it was there for marketing purposes but it’s not. It’s been gone for a long, long time.”Schactler said he doesn’t begrudge the diverted dollars because so much has changed with the nation’s fisheries since 1954.“For example, when the Magnuson-Stevens Act came about in the mid-1970s, we had to begin developing U.S. fisheries, which means doing stock assessments, and research and management clear out to 200 miles. So the money was diverted for other good reasons. We don’t see any conspiracy or back room deals.  Things are simply a lot different now,” he said.Schactler and UFA have spearheaded a National Seafood Marketing Coalition that has so far grown to 70 members in 26 states. He said the Coalition has no plans to go after the diverted dollars,   because it could have unexpected results.“Rather than going after NOAA and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,  you might end up losing some fisheries because of it,” he explained.Schactler added that millions more dollars from import duties and tariffs pass through the US Customs Office each year.  The Coalition aims to tap that for a $100 million national seafood marketing fund. He calls it an “investment program in U.S. jobs and economic development.”“This is all about food. It is not about fishing or fish – we regard this as a jobs program for  American food producers,” he said. “We are competing with protein in the world market from soybeans in Idaho to other seafoods from Southeast Asia. It’s a world protein market and we are right in the middle of it.The concept of a national seafood fund has strong support from Alaska’s delegation, according to Sen. Lisa Murkowski.  A bill on Congressional letterhead with potential sponsors and co sponsors is in discussion to be introduced to federal lawmakers soon.<COL>Humpies top projections; kings – keep fingers crossed<COL>2011-05-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/03/ocean-zoning-comes-at-huge-us-budget-costs/<COL>Ocean zoning comes at huge US Budget costsBy Laine WelchAlaska Sen. Mark Begich is quick to name the issue that’s giving him the biggest earful so far in his new post as Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard: “marine spatial planning.”The concept is listed as a top priority by the 2010 National Ocean’s Council which is already preparing to draft action plans on nine coastal/ocean objectives. It would affect all users and uses, on and beneath the oceans.“I hear it over and over again,” Sen. Begich said in a phone call from D.C. “Let’s call it like it is, pure and simple – ocean zoning. “I don’t think Dr. Lubchenco, the director of NOAA, appreciated my blunt categorization of it,” Begich added, “but as a former mayor, that’s what it is. You are determining winners and losers in terms of utilization of the oceans, and that is what zoning does.“What is the value in it?  And by what authority are they able to do this?”  he continued. “In land use zoning there is a whole process you must go through by law.  Here they are talking ocean zoning but there has yet to be any stakeholder involvement or economic analysis.”And just who are “they”?“It is a classic situation of people within the bureaucracy believing it’s a good thing to spend their time on regardless of cost,” Begich said, “When in reality, they have not worked with the stakeholders and they haven’t done their homework.”His biggest beef with ocean zoning plans is the $60 million price tag.“It’s money we don’t have,” Begich said. “With Congress reducing funding in so many areas, we can’t get ourselves stretched so thin that NOAA is doing new stuff  that takes away from research and all the rest of the work that’s necessary to maintain our core missions.”Deadline to comment to the NOC on ocean zoning and other objectives is April 29.     www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oceansBegich said among the biggest threats to Alaska and U.S. fisheries is widespread poaching by foreign fleets, called Illegal, Unregulated, Unreported fishing (IUU).“I will echo the late Sen. Ted Stevens that IUU fishing is growing to be more of a problem,” Begich said.  “Foreign poachers are taking almost 20 percent of the worldwide seafood catch. That’s huge! And it is hurting the fishery resources and taking away from the people who are  following all the rules.”Begich said a first line of IUU defense comes from the Coast Guard.“The Coast Guard needs additional resources for patrols and enforcement. Even though we have tight fiscal constraints, this is one area that is worth the additional investment.”What’s the hold up with the U.S. not ratifying the Law of the Sea Treaty, needed in order to negotiate Arctic uses and boundaries?“Part of it is we have a couple Senators who believe that it will take away our sovereignty, and our ability to manage our own waters,” Begich said, adding that he is hopeful the LOST will be ratified this year.“When you think of the countries that have not signed on to it – Libya, Iran, North Korea -  I’m not sure I want to be in that company, but we are. The reality is, every day we are not part of this agreement, we are losing part of our sovereignty.“It is estimated that there is an area of the outer continental shelf the size of California that could be available for the US to take rights to. But because we are not part of the treaty, we are unable to be at the table with other countries to negotiate boundaries and parcels that are under our control.”Speaking of his quick rise to the No. 5 leadership spot out of 51 Democrats and his chairmanship of the oceans/fisheries/Coast Guard subcommittee, Begich said:“If you asked me two years ago if I thought I’d have this opportunity so quick in my term, I would have told you no. I feel very honored. This is the committee that Ted Stevens had for many years, and it’s where the Magnuson Stevens-Act was developed.  It’s very much what I would call an Alaskan committee with huge national interest as well.”Halibut dips – About two weeks into the season, halibut prices took a tumble, which is typical after the buying frenzy for the first fresh deliveries.Opening prices at Homer topped $7 per pound when the fishery opened on March 12; ditto in major Southeast ports. Halibut prices at Kodiak started at $6.50, dropped to $6 by the second deliveries and last week were at $5 – $5.25 – $5.75 pound depending on fish size. Likewise, Homer prices dipped to $6 and $6.50 for 20 ups, and $5.50 – $6.25 and $6.50 at Southeast.Still, those prices are nothing to sneeze at, but Alaska fishermen need every penny they can get in the face of big cuts to their halibut catches -  down 47 percent in Southeast to just 2.3 million pounds,  and down 28 percent to 14.3 million pounds in the Central Gulf.Despite the overall shortfall in supply, buyers believe the market is starting to resist the record high prices. At retail, halibut fillets were fetching $17.99/pound at Costco; at 10th & M Seafoods in Anchorage fillets were $18.95 and customers were happy to have a taste of the year’s first fresh fish. The halibut fishery remains open this year through Nov. 18.Hydraulics help – Many a fishing trip has been cut short by a break down in any number of hydraulics systems, from a single pot hauler or anchor winch on skiffs to huge freezer compressors or deck cranes on floating processors.“We jokingly refer to the hydraulics as the ‘ghost of the machine’ because a lot of fishermen have a real understanding of their engines and most of their gear, but very few have a really good working knowledge of how the hydraulics actually work,” said Paul Rioux, a Sitka-based  marine hydraulics technician and instructor for an online marine hydraulics course starting next month.Fishermen brought the need for training to university program planners, who helped craft the online hydraulics classes – a first of its kind.  It includes animations on system basics, troubleshooting and hydraulics ‘lingo’ – plus direct interaction with instructors and class mates via online forums.“Modern communications have really opened things up for on line classes,” Rioux said. “It allows us to reach set netters in Bristol Bay or trollers in Yakutat Bay.”Rioux said student feedback will fine tune the course to what people really need.  The six-hour marine hydraulics course is open to everyone and can be taken over four days during three sessions in April starting on the 12th, 19th and 26th.  The charge is $95.   Contact the University of Southeast/ Sitka.   www.uas.alaska.edu/sitka    907-747-7762<COL>Ocean zoning comes at huge US Budget costs<COL>2011-03-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/11/ninety-five-percent-of-wild-salmon-comes-from-alaska/<COL>Ninety five percent of wild salmon comes from Alaskaby Laine WelchAlaska claimed the nation’s top three fishing ports for seafood catches last year, and wild salmon landings – 95 percent from Alaska – topped one billion pounds. It’s an all-time record and a 70 percent increase from 2012.That’s according to the annual Fisheries of the United States report for 2013, just released by NOAA Fisheries.Dutch Harbor topped the list for landings for the 17th year running with 753 million pounds of fish crossing the docks last year, valued at nearly $200 million. The Aleutian Islands region ranked second for landings, thanks to the big Trident plant at Akutan; Kodiak ranked third for both seafood landings and value.For the 14th year in a row, New Bedford, Mass. had the highest valued catch at $380 million. That’s due mostly to pricey sea scallops, which accounted for more than 80 percent of New Bedford’s 130 million pound landings.In all, 14 Alaska ports made the top 50 list: the Alaska Peninsula (8), Cordova (9), Ketchikan (10), Sitka (15), Petersburg (16), Seward (20), Naknek (21), Valdez (24), Bristol Bay (26), Kenai (38) and Juneau (41). Most ports showed huge increases in fish landings and values, meaning a nice return in local and state tax dollars.Overall, fishermen were paid less for their catches. The average dock price for salmon (all species) was 67 cents a pound, down a nickel from 2012. For halibut, the average price of $3.89 was a drop of 58 cents.  (All but 76,000 pounds of the nation’s halibut came from the Pacific fishery.)  The average king crab price of $5.37/lb was a decrease of 18 cents.While U.S. fishermen landed about the same amount of fish and shellfish last year - 10 billion pounds – the value of $5.5 billion was a $400 million increase from 2012.Maybe the jump in price is the reason Americans didn’t eat more seafood. The NOAA report shows U.S. per capita consumption stalled at 14.5 pounds of fish and shellfish for the second year in a row.Figures for recreational fishing activities remained strong. Nearly 9.5 million recreational saltwater anglers in the United States took more than 71 million marine fishing trips in 2013 and caught more than 430 million fish, of which, 61 percent were released alive.Find the annual Fisheries of the U.S. report atwww.noaa.govFish pirate put downCongress is poised to take direct aim at fish pirates by cutting them out of the seafood trade. The ultimate goal is to put a stop to the poaching of millions of tons of illegal, undocumented and unreported fish and shellfish taken from global waters.Led by the Alaska delegation, a Port State Measures Agreement is likely to be signed into law by year’s end. The agreement — part of the Pirate Fishing Elimination Act negotiated by the UN and Food and Agriculture Organization in 2009 — would strengthen port inspections and toughen standards for foreign flagged vessels and international shipping. By stopping the fish from reaching the market, it will reduce the incentive for poaching.“Essentially, the PSMA relies on the principle that all fish and shellfish must be landed at some port in order to enter into trade,” said Mark Gleason, executive director of Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, a harvester trade group.? For decades, no Alaska fishery has been pinched harder by illegal catches than red king crab from the Bering Sea.“We’re the poster child of what happens to your market when it’s flooded with illegal product,” Gleason said.Last year alone, 100 million pounds of pirated crab from Russia found its way into U.S. markets. (Studies estimate that more than 30 percent of total seafood imports to the U.S. were caught outside the law).? Any country that ratifies the port agreement has four primary obligations, Gleason explained. They must designate which ports foreign flagged vessels can enter; they must restrict port entry and access to port services to any vessels that have engaged in IUU fishing or support activities, including transshipment; the nation needs to conduct dockside vessel inspections in their ports, and they must share information.The pirate fishing measures have been languishing in various Congressional committees for years, but there is a good chance they will make it through Congress this session.“We’ve already signed the PSMA agreement, the Senate has agreed to ratify it, the final step is to get this implementing legislation passed,” Gleason said. “My hope is that it will be signed into law before the end of the year and the current Congress adjourns.”  ?   Alaska Senator Mark Begich agrees.“As chair of the Fisheries and U.S. Coast Guard Committee, I’m very excited about this. This puts teeth into an international treaty and agreement of our shipments of seafood and how they are handled,” Begich said. “I believe one of two things will happen: it will pass separately or be folded in as part of the USCG Reauthorization Act. I am anxious to get this passed.”“If it was left entirely to the Alaska delegation, it would be a slam dunk,” Gleason added. “Senators Murkowski, Begich and Congressman Young have been unbelievably supportive of this legislation, of the agreement and certainly of Alaska crabbers.” ?  Senator Begich said being able to move the pirate fishing and port measures is another good example of bipartisanship and working across the aisle in Congress to get things done for Alaska and U.S. fishermen.Southeast tops in salmonFishermen in Southeast Alaska hauled in the most salmon of any other region this summer –narrowly edging Prince William Sound by just 404,000 fish. The numbers are preliminary, but state figures show that the panhandle produced a catch of just over 49 million salmon, and just under that number at the Sound. Notably, nearly 44 million of the Prince William Sound salmon were pinks.Bristol Bay ranked third in terms of salmon totals at nearly 31 million fish – all but 2 million of the fish were sockeyes.? Kodiak ranked fourth for total salmon catches this summer at 14.4 million. Pinks made up the bulk of the pack, with sockeyes coming in at 3.4 million. That’s followed by the Alaska Peninsula with a harvest of 5 million salmon —  mostly reds. Cook Inlet landings were sixth at about 3.7 million salmon; nearly all sockeyes.More than 2 million salmon came out of the AYK region this summer. ?In all, Alaska’s preliminary total statewide salmon catch stands at 156 million fish; 20 million more than expected.

Mathis is also an affiliate faculty member at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks and oversees studies at Newport, Ore.Mathis explained that, in different regions of the world, natural processes (like glacial melt) are worsening the effects of ocean acidification so that a region like Prince William Sound may already be preconditioned.Ocean acidification is a global phenomenon driven by increased levels of human-produced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. It is changing the chemistry of the entire ocean at a slow, methodical pace.Since May, two Carbon Wave Gliders resembling yellow surfboards have been propelled around the Sound by wave motions to test surface water conditions. The gliders are controlled remotely via iPad from a Seattle lab.Another so-called Slocum Glider, also controlled remotely, resembles a yellow torpedo and dives down to 600 feet. Prior to using gliders, researchers were limited to contracting with boats and crews and taking about four water samples each year.“This is a revolution,” Mathis added. “Ship time is so expensive, that’s all we could afford to do.”Mathis said the gliders are a fraction of the cost, and can be left out for five months.“It will change the way we collect data; the way we can understand ecosystem environmental processes,” he said. “The ultimate goal is to understand what is going on with fisheries and biology, and communicate that to fishing communities and stakeholders in Alaska.”Mathis said data from the gliders is showing preliminary results, and will soon be deployed throughout the Gulf, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.Crabs are listeningCreepy soundtracks of noises made by predators had mud crabs running for shelter. It proved, for the first time, that the animals can hear. Marine acoustic experts at Boston’s Northeastern University made the discovery in lab tests on 200 mud crabs during a 2-year study. When scientists played certain noises, the crabs wouldn’t venture out to eat juicy clams placed in their tanks. Their skittishness reportedly lasted for several hours.Scientists said crabs hear through a small sac at the base of their antennae called a statocyst. The study found it contains thousands of sen­sory hairs that are impor­tant for the animal’s bal­ance, as well as its response to sounds.“I’m not aware of any studies that have gone into that level of detail on the sensory organs or abilities of any of the commercial crab species in Alaska,” said Bob Foy, director of NOAA Fisheries top crab lab at Kodiak. “I would not be surprised if it was the same. Sound is just a pressure wave.”According to Foy, scientists are able to measure the stress an animal is undergoing while reacting to a predator — or another organism. Other studies showed ship sounds affected foraging behavior of shore crabs.Foy also said scientists are also looking at the impacts of sonar from oil drilling and ship noises, as well as other kinds of sensory environmental impacts.”Why all Alaskans should care about fish pricesVarious business and landing taxes on fish usually equal 3 to 5 percent of dockside values, and are shared 50/50 between state coffers and local areas where the fish is delivered.Andy Wink, a seafood economist with the McDowell Group in Juneau, noted that, with commercial catches of 5 to 6 billion pounds per year, even adding or losing one penny per pound makes a difference of nearly a $1 million for both state and local governments.The industry also pays taxes and fees to cover management, marketing, hatcheries and other costs. Wink said Alaska’s seafood industry accounts for the vast majority of hatchery funding, allowing both sport and commercial fishermen the benefit of more salmon.<COL>Carbon Wave Riders track melting glaciers, ocean acidification<COL>2014-07-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/07/bristol-bay-sockeye-salmon-numbers-up-prices-down/<COL>Bristol Bay sockeye salmon numbers up; prices downby Laine WelchIt came as no surprise when the first price postings last week tanked for Bristol Bay sockeye salmon to $1.20/lb, with an extra 15 cents for chilled fish. That compares to a base price of $1.50 a pound last year.The Bristol Bay catch topped 28 million reds by Friday — 11 million more than projected — and the fish were still coming. (Alaska’s total sockeye salmon catch as of July 18 was over 37 million and counting.)Demand for the fish is strong by both foreign and US buyers, but the downward press on prices stems from lots of competing red salmon rivals in the works this year.Russia’s sockeye salmon catches topped 31 million  in early July, and that number will go higher. The largest sockeye return in 100 years is expected on British Columbia’s Fraser River; up to 75 million fish.If the Fraser run fizzles, it could mean some nice retro payments for Alaska salmon fishermen months from now. But it remains to be seen how all the sockeye dynamics play out in global markets.Pebble push backFirst Alaskans, fishermen and sportsmen around the country applauded the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to impose restrictions on large scale mining operations in the Bristol Bay region, such as the proposed Pebble Mine.A draft report released last week said development of such a mine would have “unacceptable adverse impacts” to the Bristol Bay watershed, and that action is necessary “to protect the world’s greatest salmon fishery” from what the EPA called “an open pit for copper and gold extraction nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon.”The EPA began an official push in February to protect the Bristol Bay watershed from large scale mining. In May, Pebble owners sued to stop EPA from shutting down the mining project, and the State sided with Pebble in the lawsuit.EPA administrator Dennis McLerran said on Friday that the agency’s action is not a “preemptive veto” before the mine owners apply for a permit.Using its authority under the Clean Water Act, the EPA proposes to ban any mine that would destroy more than five miles of salmon streams, or 19 miles of tributaries; fill in 1,100 or more acres of wetlands, and reroute flows of salmon streams.Public meetings in Alaska are scheduled in August. Deadline to comment on the EPA report is Sept. 19.<COL>Bristol Bay sockeye salmon numbers up; prices down<COL>2014-07-22<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2011/06/occasionally-even-the-tide-book-makes-mistakes/<COL>Occasionally even the tide book makes mistakesby Laine WelchTides rule the day for most mariners, who plan their work days based on its ebb and flow.“A tide book is like a Bible to a fishermen. It is constantly referenced – they lay their nets down by the tide, they launch by the tide – all their activity is centered around that every day,” said Jerry Thompson of Soldotna, publisher of the Alaska Tide Book for 23 years.Fishermen and other mariners are being warned that the tide information for Port Moller is off by 8 to10 hours.  The error was first noticed a few weeks ago by Richard Lovano, dock boss for 30 years at Peter Pan Seafoods at Port Moller, when he was planning the best time to work under the company dock.“I started watching the tide first thing in the morning and it was low at 9 a.m. and not high like it was supposed to be. So that’s how I became aware that the tides were way off,” Lovano said in a phone interview.But don’t blame the tide books, said Thompson.“It’s not only a situation with our book, but the official tides published by NOAA include the same data.  So anyone who is buying a tide product based on NOAA’s predictions has these incorrect tides,” he explained.Thompson said it takes nearly 17 years of study to nail down the predictions for a particular location before   tides can confidently be predicted for an area. He suspects NOAA miscalculated when it upgraded Port Moller from a secondary to a primary station in 2009, and no longer bases tides off of the Nushagak.“This is whole new set of harmonic files NOAA produced for Port Moller, and we’re not sure yet what happened with this particular set of data. But it is considerably off from what we have traditionally been using,” he added.Despite its distance down the Alaska Peninsula, Port Moller is a busy place all year for hundreds of fishing boats, freighters, barges and tenders.“Port Moller has the only land based processing and vessel support facility between Unimak Island and Ugashik,” said Lee Ann McDermott, office manager for Peter Pan.  “Virtually all vessels travelling from the Gulf of Alaska to Bristol Bay will travel outside Port Moller, sometimes coming into the port for refueling or emergency repairs.”“It affects everyone passing by,” said Lovano.  “Even during the winter when we’re not here, Bering Sea crabbers and other boats know there is a dock they can get to, and if they need to medevac someone out of here, they know it can be done.  If the tide is 10 to 2 hours off, it can really affect what is going on with them,” said Lovano.Thompson said he is troubled that NOAA has been slow to respond to the incorrect tide data.“It’s really disconcerting to me that we are not getting a quicker response from NOAA. I believe at the very least they should issue some sort of public service announcement and let people know – because it’s not only our book, it’s every published tide table, every computer software program for generating tides, all have this information,” he said.Todd Ehret, a physical oceanographer at NOAA, said in a May 25 email that the tide predictions for Port Moller were wrong and have been corrected.“The database error which caused a near reversal of the predicted tides in the Time Meridian field of the database for this station has been corrected (on NOAA’s web site). This error is an isolated incident, and is unlikely to recur in the future,” Ehret said.  He added that a Notice to Mariners will be issued to the Coast Guard.Jerry Thompson agreed that the error is unusual.“In 23 years of working with NOAA and producing tide books, nothing like this has ever happened on their end,” he said, adding one caveat.“For 10 years the tide predictions for Bethel have been off by as much as three hours and it is very irritating for the local community,” Thompson said.  “We have discussed it many times with many NOAA agencies and they feel they are relatively close and blame it on low water in the river.   So we have been publishing a non supported NOAA tide because the locals says that’s what works for them.  You have to believe your eyes,” Thompson said.Find accurate tide information for all Alaska regions, including a printable copy for Port Moller, at www.tidebooks.com/.Easy newsGetting news about Alaska’s commercial fisheries has gotten easier. ADF&G has launched a new online system for distributing news releases for fishery openings and closures and other updates for fisheries all over the state. The system replaces the older method of news releases being published in different ways by separate districts all over the state.“This is a more efficient way of doing things because we have one system we are all using and it is a much quicker process to post and distribute releases to emails,”  said Geron Bruce, assistant director of the commercial fisheries division.The new ‘clearinghouse’ method will be easier for the public to navigate, he added.“Once you subscribe you will automatically receive in your email inbox every news release that is issued by the division at the time it is issued.”Announcements about subsistence fisheries and state managed personal use fisheries are included.  The new email system will be in place on May 31.

Between 2000 and 2009, 155 fishermen lost their lives from falling overboard; none was wearing a PFD. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is offering a free DVD on the importance of wearing PFDs on deck, and more importantly, how to  get a man back on the boat.“ That’s really the big thing for us – how do you retrieve the guy, how do you monitor him in the water to make sure he is still able to make it to the boat and get him back over the rail,” said Ted Teske, A NIOSH Health Communication Specialist.Response to the free DVD has been very strong, Teske said. The Southeast Alaska Dive Association has ordered several hundred. The Alaska Scallop Association has taken it a step further and set a policy of 100% PFD usage on deck.“That’s one of the recommendations we have for vessel owners and skippers. Make a concrete policy with the crew so they know what is expected of them,” he said.

While the outcomes might get mixed rants and reviews, no one is ever denied the chance to state ideas, concerns and gripes to decision-makers.Several opportunities are available right now:First off, a revised draft of the Magnuson-Stevens Act was just released for public review and comment. The MSA is the primary federal law that governs all fisheries management in U.S. waters; it is undergoing reauthorization targeted for completion at the end of this year. Comments will be taken until the bill moves through the Senate to the full Congress for final action. Find more information at the Department of Commerce website.Comments can also be sent to Senator Mark Begich, who chairs the Senate committee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard.Revised protection measures are being proposed for Western Steller sea lions in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The changes could reopen fishing for cod, Atka mackerel and other groundfish for the first time in five years. Comments to NOAA Fisheries are accepted through Aug. 15.It’s the last chance to comment on the proposed KSM gold/copper open-pit mine just 19 miles north of the Alaska border. KSM would be one of the largest mines in North America, operating at the headwaters of trans-boundary rivers flowing to Juneau, Petersburg and other Southeast Alaska regions. Currently, there are no enforceable policies in place to safeguard Alaska’s fish and clean water from upstream industrial development. Deadline to comment is Aug. 20.The public has until Sept. 19 to comment to the Environmental Protection Agency on its intent to protect salmon and habitat at Bristol Bay by imposing tough watershed restrictions on large mines in the region. The EPA has scheduled a series of seven public hearings starting Aug. 12 in Anchorage, followed by meetings throughout the Bristol Bay region.Fish skin basketsAudrey Armstrong of Galena remembers the day she was first inspired to make beautiful things from salmon skins. It was Sept. 4, 2002 and she was mesmerized by a king salmon she had caught.“The colors were so beautiful, I said to myself, ‘I know a long time ago they used to make garments and baskets and different containers out of fish skin. I wonder if I could make something out of this skin,’ Armstrong said in a phone interview. “And that is how I started.”It was difficult to learn the traditional techniques, as the history for the old ways was lost.“There was nothing really written, and I think the oldest piece I saw from my culture was from 1849,” she said. “It was a child’s mittens made out of fish skins. They are so beautiful. So now the majority of us working with fish skin it is all by trial and error, and by talking to other people who are working with fish skin and trying to bring it back. We are all learning from each other.”    ?Armstrong uses an ulu to clean and scrape any fat from the skins, which   keeps them from spoiling. She cleans and freezes the skins and hand sews each piece as it is pulled from a cooler.“It will dry out real fast as you are sewing, so you have to keep putting it back in the cooler,” she said. “…  my baskets have this hard surface to the skin. and I decorate them with beads, abalone and dentalia shells to represent the status of our Athabascan chiefs.”Armstrong’s favorite fish skin to work with is king salmon. She has won numerous art awards for her work, which is displayed across Alaska and elsewhere. She also shares her skill at workshops all over the state.New fish advisorGovernor Parnell on Friday appointed Ben Mohr as his new fisheries advisor. Mohr previously was public information specialist for the Pebble Partnership for six years, and was former campaign manager for Dan Sullivan, candidate for U.S. Senate. Mohr replaces Stephanie Moreland as the governor’s fisheries advisor.Fish fundsTwo Sitka fishing projects received grant awards from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Fisheries Innovation Fund, a program launched in 2010 to support sustainable U.S. fisheries and fishermen.The Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust received $135,000 to develop and deploy processes “for inter-generational transfer of fishery rights and best practices.” The proposed project “utilizes existing legal and financial mechanisms in a novel way to achieve the goal of increased retention of economic benefits from fisheries in Gulf of Alaska communities.”Another $38,000 went to the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association to move electronic monitoring systems from a pilot stage to use out on the water.<COL>Have more say in shaping Alaska’s fisheries policies<COL>2014-07-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/08/destruction-from-breached-mine-tailings-be-dammed/<COL>Destruction from breached mine tailings be ‘dammed’by Laine WelchAs millions of Fraser River sockeye salmon head for spawning beds polluted by a brew of metal toxins oozing from the Mount Polley gold/copper mine disaster in British Columbia, Republican candidates vying for U.S. Senate want environmental regulators to butt out of Alaska’s mining development decisions.The three men hoping to unseat Mark Begich faced off last week for a Rural Alaska Republican Candidates forum hosted by KYUK/Bethel.To questions posed by moderator Ben Matheson, candidates Joe Miller, Mead Treadwell and Dan Sullivan all slammed the Environmental Protection Agency for its plans to impose strict water requirements aimed at blocking the proposed Pebble Mine. Each candidate also agreed with legislation recently introduced in the Senate (by Murkowski and two other senators) that says the EPA cannot use its authority under the Clean Water Act “pre-emptively or retroactively.”“To have the EPA come in and take power away from the permitting process is not necessarily going to solve the Pebble problem, and it’s going to hurt mines all over the state,” said Lt. Governor Mead Treadwell. “When I say solve the Pebble problem, this is something we just can’t say we’re not going to do the science; we can’t say we’re not going to look at a permit. This is a big piece of our state’s statehood bounty and we have to be able to make sure that we’ve got that capability.“As we go through the Pebble process, looking for an easy yes or no answer can have huge effects on other mining, other resource development projects in the state and we have to be extremely careful. And I believe the EPA solidly over reached on this one,” Treadwell said, concluding with a barb at Sen. Begich, who opposes the Pebble Mine, for “not letting the State make its own decisions and sending the decisions back to Washington.”Dan Sullivan, former state Attorney General and DNR Commissioner, said “the pre-emptive veto is another example of this administration acting in a lawless manner.” He also questioned if the EPA even has the legal authority to act.“When a company comes in and is asked by the State to explore the resources — which is what happened in the Pebble case — they should be allowed to go through the permitting process,” Sullivan said. “It’s State land, a project they haven’t seen the details of yet, and they are saying they have pre-emptive authority under the Clean Water Act – I don’t think they do. To me, this sets a bad precedent all over the state. I’ve been someone who’s had a career of not only talking about the EPA, but actually taken them on and gone to court against them.”Joe Miller agreed, saying the EPA “has been used as a hammer against the State.”“We have to push back against the EPA at every point we have,” Miller said. “It’s a State issue, and the State should be in charge of it; and the state should do it in a way the people direct.”And that is exactly what has been done, sirs.The candidates disregard the fact that the EPA came to Alaska to assess the impacts of large-scale mining to the Bristol Bay Region after two years of relentless urging by more than a dozen First Alaska groups, plus thousands of commercial and sport fishermen and residents.Super salmon PRCordovans have long used a tactic to make sure their region’s famous salmon remains in the spotlight; they invite food pros from all over the country and show them the ropes. Eight visitors were in town two weeks ago for the annual sockeye tour, including a cookbook writer, radio journalist, food bloggers and photographers.“We showed them the Copper River watershed and how it is a big part of our fishery,” said Nelly Hand, executive director of the Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association. “We went out to the glacier and they got to see the sonar counting station from ADF&G and the practices done here for sustainability. We took them through a processing plant and out fishing on the Copper River delta; they met State biologists and got be part of the community.”A highlight, of course, was eating the fish in a sort of movable feast.“We did a moveable pot luck with local fishermen’s wives’ homes in Cordova,” Hand said. “We had salmon cooked every single way; chowder, smoked, caviar.”This is the seventh year Cordova’s salmon fishermen have invited Outside visitors to town; and they bring a whole lot more along with them.“Our guests were on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, sharing pictures and live updates of what they were learning during the week,” Hand said. “People across the country could also experience what we were doing every single day.”Another group of visitors arrives in late August for a coho tour to round out the season. Hand credits the local fishermen’s marketing association for the program’s success. The State created an opportunity in 2004 for fishermen to tax themselves on their catches (any species) and form their own marketing groups.“There’s a big generation of young fishermen who are really passionate about what they are doing,” Hand said. “To see them put the work in and want to see their fish go as far as it can; it’s exciting to be a part of that.”<COL>Destruction from breached mine tailings be ‘dammed’<COL>2014-08-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/08/russias-retaliation-to-sanctions-a-direct-hit-to-alaska/<COL>Russia’s retaliation to sanctions a direct hit to AlaskaBy Laine WelchSeafood is by far Alaska’s top export, and as it heads overseas, global politics play a big role in making sales sink or swim. That dynamic took center stage last week when Russia banned imports of foods for one year from the U.S., Canada, Europe, Norway and Australia in retaliation for sanctions imposed due to its aggressive actions in Ukraine.It is a direct hit to Alaska, which last year exported nearly 20 million pounds of seafood to Russia, valued at more than $60 million. The primary product it hurts is pink and chum salmon roe; Russia is also a growing market for Alaska pollock surimi.“After Japan, Russia is our largest market for salmon roe,” explained Alexa Tonkovich, International Program Director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI). “Japan takes about $125 million worth of salmon roe and Russia takes about $46 million (more than 7 million pounds).Russia’s ban also takes a bite out of Alaska pollock surimi exports, valued at more thsn $8 million in 2013. But that market is much more diversified than Alaska’s salmon roe.“There are good markets in Japan and Europe, and we see potential in Brazil for surimi products, so that may be a bit easier to absorb,” Tonkovich said. “The salmon roe is a pretty significant volume, so I see a greater impact for salmon than for pollock.”Frozen pinks will also be affected, said John Sackton.“In 2013, virtually no frozen pinks were sold to Russia,” he explained. “But in 2014, that jumped from less than $250,000 to $3.3 million.”Even before the ban, the troubled political climate had ASMI’s international team planning new and expanding market opportunities for Alaska seafood. At this point, Tonkovich said uncertainty rules the day.“There is a bit of stress in the seafood industry right now,” she said. “Things are in limbo and it’s hard to know how it will play out over time.”Polly wanna panelThe Mount Polley mine tailings disaster in British Columbia quickly prompted both Alaska U.S. Senators to urge the State Department for more oversight on mining projects on trans-boundary rivers.In letters last week to Secretary John Kerry, Murkowski and Begich both specifically referenced the KSM Mine being built less than 20 miles from Southeast Alaska’s border. Plans call for KSM to be seven times larger than Mount Polley, and a similar accident could affect the Taku, Unuk and Stikine Rivers; all major salmon producers.Senators Murkowski and Begich are calling for a bilateral panel review on KSM, as well as other planned mines that could affect Southeast fish and habitat. They’re also pushing for accelerated U.S. oversight before the BC projects are finally approved.Meanwhile, Alaska officials are defending mine regulators in Canada, saying their environmental protection measures are as strong as those in Alaska or the Lower 48.It takes guts to talk fishCandidates for Alaska governor will be in the nation’s No. 3 fishing port next week to “talk fish” to a statewide audience. Governor Sean Parnell, Byron Mallott and Bill Walker all were quick to confirm their attendance several months ago. Since 1990, Kodiak’s Chamber of Commerce has hosted fisheries debates for Alaska governor and U.S. Senate candidates. The debate is limited to a single topic: the seafood industry.As always, the two-hour event will be broadcast live via the Alaska Public Radio Network, and streamed by host station KMXT. Check your local radio listings. The “goober” debate (irreverently short for “gubernatorial”) is set for Aug. 28, at Kodiak High School from 7-9 p.m.Dungies do it!Crabbers in Southeast Alaska just wrapped up their best summer Dungeness crab season ever. The total catch is pegged at 4 million pounds. It’s the largest summer harvest since 2002, and a 142 percent increase from 2013. That makes for a nice pay day for 150 crabbers who averaged about $3 a pound — up 50 cents from last year. The summer catch adds up to at least $11 million at the docks, making it one of the highest on record.Alaska’s most far-flung crab fishery — golden king crab along the Aleutians — got underway Aug. 15. It’s the state’s most stable crab fishery with a conservative harvest each year capped at just over 6 million pounds.Salmon blastHelp is on the way for Washington State salmon, where migration is blocked by dams or environmental hazards. A company called “Whooshh Innovations” has come up with a literal fish cannon. Salmon swim into a tube and can be shot more than 500 feet into the air, landing safely in waters upstream. A test run is underway at the Roza Dam, 10 miles north of Yakima. More are planned.<COL>Russia’s retaliation to sanctions a direct hit to Alaska<COL>2014-08-19<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/09/sullivan-changes-schedule-to-attend-kodiak-fisheries-debate/<COL>Sullivan changes schedule to attend Kodiak fisheries debateBy Laine WelchThe lure of reaching a statewide audience was too much for U.S. Senate hopeful Dan Sullivan to pass up. He will be at the Oct. 1 Kodiak fisheries debate after all.Sullivan was able to reshuffle a packed travel schedule to fit in the fisheries event, said Ben Sparks, campaign manager. Sullivan initially was going to be in Bethel on a multi-day swing through Southwest Alaska during the time of the Kodiak event.“Dan recognizes the importance of Alaska’s fisheries, and our campaign has rescheduled our southwest swing to ensure that Dan could make the debate. He looks forward to a healthy exchange of ideas with Mark Begich on the future of Alaska’s fisheries, and is excited to attend the debate in Kodiak,” his campaign said in a prepared statement.Since 1990, the fisheries debates have been an election year tradition and have always attracted 100 percent participation by leading candidates. The debates are limited to one topic: Alaska’s seafood industry.Sullivan, a former Alaska Attorney General and Dept. of Natural Resources Commissioner, will face off for one hour against incumbent senator Mark Begich, chair of the U.S. Senate subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard.Also on deck: For a second hour, U.S. House Representative Don Young will debate fish issues against Democratic newcomer Forrest Dunbar, who said he is expecting it to be tough.“I worked as a commercial fisherman growing up in Cordova, and I care passionately about our fishing industry,” said Dunbar. “I’ll be taking my own preparation seriously in the coming weeks.”The Congressional Fisheries Debate is set for Oct. 1 from 7-9 p.m. and will be broadcast live via KMXT/Kodiak and AK Public Radio Network stations.Fish watchFall means fish meetings that shape the management and oversight for all of Alaska’s fisheries. The plan to rein in Gulf of Alaska trawl bycatch via some form of catch-share program will top the North Pacific Fishery Management Council’s agenda in early October. The council oversees all fisheries in federal waters, meaning three to 200 miles out. The NPFMC meets Oct. 6-14 at the Anchorage Hilton.Closer to shore, the state Board of Fisheries will get its meeting cycle underway at a two-day work session starting Oct. 15 in Juneau. Salmon and other fisheries at Prince William Sound, Upper Copper River and the Upper Susitna River start the regional focus this year, followed by Southeast and Yakutat finfish and crab management issues. The “fish board” oversees all commercial, sport and subsistence fisheries in state waters. It will meet in Cordova, Wrangell and Sitka throughout the winter.Coming soonCatch numbers for mid-October Bering Sea crab fisheries will be out soon, followed by preliminary catch numbers for 2015 halibut catches.Hats off to the United Fishermen of Alaska, which is celebrating 40 years of advocating for Alaska’s fishing industry. UFA is the nation’s largest fishing trade association with nearly 40 member groups.Veteran fisheries writer Wesley Loy is the editor at Pacific Fishing Magazine. He takes over for Don McManman who retired. Loy also writes the popular Deckboss blog.Naked TruthWorld class fisheries depend on clean water and Southeast Alaskans are stripping down to make that point.“Water quality issues are becoming the biggest issues we have to deal with in Southeast. Long ago it was forestry, but as that industry has slowed down and mining and industrial tourism via cruise ships has sped up, our relatively pristine waters face more threats than they ever have,” said Malena Marvin, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. The council has advocated for protecting the world’s largest temperate rain forest, the Tongass, since 1970.To highlight the need to keep it clean, the council has launched the Inside Passage Water Keeper Program, and aligned itself with the International Water Keeper Alliance.A “Naked Truth about Clean Water” calendar for 2015 is one of the items being rolled out this fall to introduce the Inside Passage program.  The call is out for photos from Southeast fishermen, charters, whale watchers ; water lovers of all kinds can bare it all, but must demurely hide the goods.“We want people to have fun and think of cool ways to showcase how their family or business depends on Southeast Alaska’s amazing clean water,” Marvin said. “Obviously, we are looking for G-rated photos, so keep the fish, the kayak or whatever have you strategically placed.”Entries should also include a statement with your take on the naked truth about clean water. Deadline is Oct. 1. Along with the calendar display, winners get “regional notoriety” and a T-shirt.

That’s garnered a big sigh of relief from harvesters across the nation, and kudos to a rare show of bipartisanship by coastal lawmakers; notably Senators Begich of Alaska and Marco Rubio of Florida.“The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act extends a moratorium that was already granted to the commercial fishing industry from 2008,” explained Brett Veerhusen, executive director of Seafood Harvesters of America. Verrhusen has been watch-dogging the discharge bill that comes up every couple of years. “It would extend this moratorium indefinitely so commercial fishing vessels don’t have to apply for a ridiculous discharge permit every time rain falls onto your deck and flows overboard. That’s incidental discharge to the normal operation of a vessel. So it just cuts the red tape that fishermen would have to incur.”The incidental discharge requirement is part of the Clean Boating Act passed by Congress in 2008. It provided a permanent exemption for roughly 13 million recreational vessels — even 400-foot yachts — but not for commercial fishing boats or other vessels in the maritime industries. The measure affects nearly 10,000 fishing vessels in Alaska alone, and harvesters believe the permanent exclusion should also apply to them.Veerhusen said it is imperative that the discharge dodge is passed before the temporary exemption expires on Dec. 18. The measure awaits final approval from Congress, but Veerhusen is confident it will make it through.Seafood Harvesters of America formed in June and, so far, includes 14 regional fishing groups.  Veerhusen, who hails from a Homer fishing family, said the new group has been well-received in DC.Yay Coasties!Aug. 4 marks the 224th birthday of our nation’s oldest sea-going service – the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard was launched in 1790 as the U.S. Lighthouse Service, when the first Congress gave orders to build 10 vessels to enforce tariff and trade laws under the newly formed Treasury Department.At the time, it was the only source of revenue for the federal government. It was called the Revenue Cutter Service until 1915, when it was merged with the Life-Saving Service and received its present name from Congress.In the Coast Guard’s Top-10 list of most memorable missions, the response to Hurricane Katrina ranks as No. 1, where the Coast Guard is credited with saving more than 33,000 people. Two Alaska events made the list. One was the rescue of 520 people after a fire broke out and sank the cruise ship Prinsendam, 130 miles off Ketchikan in 1980. In 1897, six Coast Guardsmen set off from a Cutter near Point Barrow to save the crews of eight whaling ships trapped in the ice. Using dog sleds, they brought 400 reindeer to the whalers in a 1,500 mile journey that took more than two months.The single largest rescue effort in Coast Guard history was in 1937, when a flood on the Mississippi River led to the rescue of 44,000 people — and more than 100,000 head of livestock. Today, roughly 40,000 men and women serve in the U.S. Coast Guard. They are credited for saving more than 1 million lives —and counting.Kelp crazeKelp is the latest crop fish farmers are cashing in on, and Alaska could follow Canada’s innovation and success. That country’s largest salmon grower, Cooke Aquaculture, recently launched its own line of certified organically grown seaweeds of two different kinds: winged and sugar kelp. They are sold under Cooke’s True North Salmon brand and both can be served fresh or cooked.The sea plants are grown in New Brunswick’s Bay of Fundy, in an Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaculture farm. They also grow blue mussels and Atlantic salmon. The floating farms are designed to mimic the natural ocean ecosystem, and combine species that require manual feeding (i.e. salmon), with species that derive nutrients from the wastes of the “fed” species.Kelp and other aquatic plants sustain a multi-billion industry throughout Asia, and more Americans are adding the sea veggies to their diets. Kelp is also widely used in foods and beverages, animal feeds, cosmetics, and soon – bio-fuels.Alaska seaweeds got a shout out this year when researchers at North Carolina State University found that common plants found in waters and beaches near Sitka are super-packed with compounds that fight obesity, diabetes and heart diseases.Growing more sea plants in Alaska is a focus of a new mariculture initiative that is building support for expansion and enhancement.“We are broadening the concept of mariculture,” said Julie Decker, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, and mariculture project leader. An area of special interest, she said, is Western Alaska, where no mariculture ventures have ever been attempted.Seewww.afdf.orgfor more informationFish watchWith a few exceptions, most of Alaska’s salmon fisheries are rather lackluster. By Friday the statewide salmon catch had topped 90 million; more than 40 million were sockeyes. Nearly 29 million of the reds were from Bristol Bay, 17 million higher than the preseason forecast. The statewide pink catch was nearing 41 million, with more than 28 million humpies coming from Prince William Sound. The glut of holdover pinks from last year’s record run has pushed prices down to about 25 cents a pound statewide. Chilled and delivered pinks run a few cents more. The Lower Yukon is enjoying its highest chum catch since 1989 at nearly half a million fish.In other fisheries, jig boats continue fishing for cod and black rockfish around Kodiak and Cook Inlet. Jiggers are also fishing for ling cod at Prince William Sound, while trawlers continue to target sidestripe shrimp. For halibut, 62 percent of the catch has been taken, with less than six million pounds remaining of the 16-million-pound catch limit. For sablefish, 68 percent of the nearly 24-million-pound quota was taken, with 7.5 million pounds remaining.Pollock fishing continues in the Bering Sea, along with cod and numerous flounder fisheries. Red king crab was set to close at Norton Sound on Aug. 3, with a 354,090-pound catch. The Aleutians golden king crab season opens in mid-August, with a harvest topping 6 million pounds. Pollock reopens in the Gulf on Aug. 25.The biggest fish story this week is the Dungeness crab fishery in Southeast, which is seeing its best season ever. The total catch this year is pegged at nearly 6.5 million pounds for 150 crabbers. The Dungeness crabs are getting about $3 pound, up 50 cents from last year. The summer fishery closes Aug. 15 and reopens Oct. 1.<COL>Incidental Discharge Act to provide exclusion for commercial fishing industry<COL>2014-08-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/09/sullivan-bows-out-of-kodiak-fisheries-debate/<COL>Sullivan bows out of Kodiak fisheries debateby Laine Welch“Surprised and disappointed” was the reaction by Senator Mark Begich upon learning his opponent Dan Sullivan has bowed out of an Oct. 1 fisheries debate in Kodiak. It is the second time this year that Sullivan has declined to participate in the Chamber of Commerce event that has been an election year tradition since 1990.“I can’t recall a time that a candidate has not participated in the Kodiak debate,” Begich said as he readied to head back to DC on Friday. “It’s a must-do for statewide candidates. It’s not an option. It’s clear he doesn’t have the same Alaska values as we do when it comes to our fisheries, and I think he is doing an incredible disservice to Alaskans.”Sullivan campaign manager Ben Sparks told debate organizers that Sullivan does not have a prior commitment keeping him from the fisheries debate, but that “he is just too busy with all the traveling he is doing.” The two-hour debate is broadcast live to more than 330 Alaska communities.“I think it’s a shame, because Alaskans will miss out on a forum that focuses on the largest employer in the state,” Senator Begich added. “Seafood is our biggest export by far, and nearly 85 percent of all the fish caught in Alaska comes from waters that are under federal jurisdiction. If you can’t even have a debate, how do Alaskans know where he stands?”Sullivan already has a reputation for shunning Alaska media and was criticized last week for avoiding a debate on Native rights issues in Juneau.The fisheries debate will go on, said Trevor Brown, executive director of the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce.“We have pre-sold lots of sponsorships and lined up all the radio stations. Senator Begich will be there, and hopefully, other third party U.S. Senate candidates. We also are talking about adding an hour for U.S. House candidates Don Young and Forrest Dunbar if both can make it,” Brown said.History shows that, since 1990, no candidate who has skipped the Kodiak fisheries debate has gone on to win their election.Plug in!Electricity is any boat’s lifeline. A new self-paced, online course will show all mariners how to spot and fix basic electrical problems on any vessel.“You get a 30-year-old boat and some of the wiring is just amazing,” said Alan Sorum, a former Valdez harbormaster and collaborator on the Boat Electrical Systems course offered now at the University of Alaska/Southeast. “Somebody adds or takes something out and they leave the old wiring behind.”Wiring is just one of eight modules in the course that use animations, YouTube videos and direct contacts with experts at the Sitka campus. Being able to deliver it online and at a distance has been the “great bridge,” said Torie Baker, an Alaska Sea Grant advisor in Cordova and a partner in the project.“There’s been a real need for this basic, but upgraded look at these kinds of electrical systems,” Baker said “Classes like this help you systematically understand what you’re up against, how to troubleshoot it and the tools that you need.”Both agreed a top feature of the electrical course is the focus on troubleshooting. Sorum said just knowing the basic rights and wrongs of bonding and grounding, for example, would prevent a harbormaster’s biggest headache.The boat electrical course is open for sign-ups now. The 10-15 hour course is self-paced over three months and costs $125. Contact UAS for more info.Fish watchBristol Bay’s 2014 salmon harvest of 31 million fish adds up to a preliminary value of $197 million to fishermen, the second-highest ever and 79 percent above the 20-year average. (The highest was $202 million in 1990.)For sockeye salmon, the catch of 28.8 million was 61 percent higher than expected, with a dockside value of nearly $193 million.Norton Sound fishermen also were seeing a nice salmon payday. The harvest for chums has been one of the best in 25 years, and the fourth best ever for silvers, said Jim Menard, regional fisheries manager based in Nome.With local buyers paying one to two dollars per fish, fishermen should end up with a record $1.5 million season. Menard said 120 permits fished Norton Sound this summer, compared to just 12 in 2002.Increased interest from salmon buyers also has boosted the economy at Kotzebue. This year, three local buyers were competing for chums, compared to none 12 years ago. Fishermen delivered $3 million dollars in salmon this year, just short of the $3.25 million dollar record set in 1981.<COL>Sullivan bows out of Kodiak fisheries debate<COL>2014-09-09<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/08/scientists-search-for-answers-to-chinook-decline/<COL>Scientists search for answers to Chinook declineby Laine WelchMore than 100 researchers and three dozen projects are underway to find clues as to why Alaska’s Chinook salmon production has declined since 2007.The ambitious effort marks the start of a state-backed, five-year, $30 million Chinook Salmon Research Initiative that includes 12 major river systems from Southeast Alaska to the Yukon. And while it will be years before the project yields definitive data, the scientists have pinned down some early findings.“It’s not the fresh water production of the juvenile Chinook that is the reason this decline is occurring, it’s being driven by poor marine survival,” said Ed Jones, the lead for the Initiative and Sport Fish Coordinator for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. “We don’t know why, but once these juvenile Chinook salmon are entering the ocean, they are not surviving at the rates they once did.”At each river system, the Chinook team is estimating how many young fish are going to the ocean, refining estimates of how many older fish are returning to spawn, and tracking the marine catches.“That’s an effort to estimate the harvests of these 12 indicator stocks in detail,” he explained. “So we’re going to implement tagging programs on the juveniles, and as they go out to the ocean, they’ll be marked with an adipose fin clip. We also will include a tiny coded wire tag in their heads and those will be sent to the Juneau lab where we can tell when and where those fish were released. With those three components, we can do full stock reconstruction.” Jones said his primary focus is on the Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers, because of the importance of Chinook salmon to subsistence users.“A major part of this initiative is to make sure we can help those folks fish when there’s fish around and pull the reins back when they are not around,” Jones said. “But we need to gather the information that allows us to do that accurately each and every year. We are trying to learn from the users and gather information on historical harvests, what the people know and what they’ve learned for centuries. We’ll feed that information into our stock assessment program.”Chinook salmon spend up to five years in the ocean, and production goes through up and down cycles. A few years ago, west coast and British Columbia stocks were said to be doomed, but they have rebounded and are at record numbers in some cases. Jones believes that’s what will also occur in Alaska.“The take-home message is that productivity cycles; unfortunately, in Alaska right now, we are at the low end of that cycle,” he said. “We are experiencing a tough time right now, but it will turn around, so don’t lose hope.”Chinook checksThe first installment of disaster relief money will soon be on its way to Alaska fishermen hurt by low Chinook salmon returns to the Yukon, Kuskokwim and Cook Inlet regions. Disasters were declared by Governor Parnell for those three regions in 2012, opening the door for relief payments from the feds.NOAA Fisheries announced last week that $7.8 million will be distributed in direct payments to fishermen for their losses. The payments break out at $3.2 million for the Yukon-Kuskokwim Region and $4.6 million for the Cook Inlet Region. The checks will be administered by the Pacific States Marine Fishery Commission, and according to Senator Begich’s office, should be in the mail in September or October.State mum on mine messLast week, a coalition of Alaskans and some of the state’s largest fishing groups joined with the Congressional delegation to urge Secretary of State John Kerry to intervene with Canada as five large scale mines prepare to go on line in watersheds that feed into Southeast Alaska’s most productive salmon rivers.The five mines are part of a larger mineral development push by B.C. Premier Christy Clark, who has pledged to create eight new mines and expand nine more by next year.Alaskans are citing the Boundary Waters Treaty between the U.S. and Canada, which states that trans-boundary waters “shall not be polluted on either side to the injury of health or property on the other side.”“Using that treaty might get the Canadians’ attention,” said Brian Lynch, director of the Petersburg Vessel Owners Association. “At least it would start the conversation.”The state of Alaska has made no statements on either the Aug. 4 Mount Polley mining disaster or the threats the new BC mines pose to Southeast waters.<COL>Scientists search for answers to Chinook decline<COL>2014-08-26<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/05/commercial-fishing-value-doubles-recreational-sector/<COL>Commercial fishing value doubles recreational sectorby Laine WelchThe debate over which sector — commercial or recreational fishing — provides the bigger economic punch can finally be put to rest.The annual “Fisheries Economics of the U.S.” report by the Department of Commerce shows once and for all that in terms of values, jobs, sales and incomes, the commercial sector far outscores recreational fishing. A breakdown of the extensive report by market analyst John Sackton shows that in 2012, commercial fishing had $140 billion in sales compared to $58 billion for sport fishing. And for the value contributed to the national economy, commercial fishing added nearly $60 billion — double the recreational sector.In terms of jobs, the seafood industry employed 1.27 million people compared to 380,000 for sports anglers. The most striking difference, Sackton said, is where those people are employed. For sport fishing, employment was building boats and engines, representing 82 percent of both employment and sales and is very regionally concentrated. The NOAA report added that less than 20 percent of the jobs in the sport industry come from guides, boat operators, tackle shops and various rentals.For the commercial fishing industry, the value and jobs created are spread throughout the entire country. The recreational sector is  concentrated in a few states and industries. For example, Florida accounted for 30 percent of all U.S. recreational fishing jobs. Add the Gulf States and North Carolina, and the number jumps to nearly half the national total.The economic benefits of the commercial seafood sector also penetrate all parts of the U.S. and the economy. Unlike his sport counterparts, a fisherman in Alaska is supporting dozens of other U.S. jobs in retail, wholesale, distribution and import sectors. In short, the facts negate the argument that recreational fishing has a greater or more direct economic impact than the commercial fishery.The economics report also breaks down information by region. In terms of prices, the report shows that of 10 key U.S. species, sea scallops, Pacific halibut and sablefish received the highest ex-vessel (dock) prices in 2012 at $9.83, $4.48 and $3.42 per pound, respectively.Menhaden and pollock had the lowest ex-vessel prices in 2012 at $0.07 and $0.12 per pound. However, landings of both species were the largest in the U.S. at 1.77 billion pounds of menhaden and 2.87 billion pounds of pollock.

The contest, which began in 2005 by the World Wildlife Fund, rewards new gear ideas that help fishermen retain target catches while letting marine mammals, turtles, birds or small fish swim away.This year’s competition offers the largest prize pool ever, said program director, Michael Osmond in a phone interview.“There is a $30,000 grand prize, two $10,000 runner-up prizes, and we have two $7,500 that we call special bycatch prizes,” Osmond said. “One of them is a tuna bycatch reduction prize, and the other is a marine mammal bycatch reduction prize.”The competition goes beyond cash prizes, he added.“The second step is to get those ideas to the stage where they can actually be used by industry, and doing the job they were designed to do,” he said.WWWF and its partners continue working with gear innovators and — to date — almost 50 percent of the winning ideas from the competition are now out on the water. That includes the 2011winners: Japan’s double-weight branchline that prevents seabird bycatch; Florida’s “Seaqualizer” that lets fish with air bladders be safely returned to deep water; and California’s simple LED lights or glow sticks that keep turtles away from gillnets.Osmond said 60 to 70 percent of the gear entries come from fishermen — as do the majority of winning ideas. The 2011 competition attracted 74 entries from a record 31 countries. Osmond said Alaska is always in the mix with three or four entries.“We haven’t yet had a winning idea from Alaska,” he said, “but this year is just as good a chance as any.”Deadline to enter the Smart Gear contest is Aug. 31.   Go to www.smartgear.orgPollock opp flopIt’s the peak time of the year for jig fishing for cod, and 60 boats have landed more than 1.5 million pounds of a nearly 6-million-pound quota. At the same time, jiggers can keep as much pollock as they catch. But so far it hasn’t been much of a draw.“No one seems to be taking advantage of the pollock jig fishery in the sense that they are going out and targeting pollock,” said Matt Keyse, a regional manager at Fish and Game in Kodiak.So far, 15,000 pounds of pollock was delivered by jig boats. Keyes said that’s about average.“Every year, jig cod boats tend to land between 20-30,000 pounds of pollock,” he added. “I  expect we’ll be in that same range if things remain the same.”The jig cod price at Kodiak is 35 cents a pound; pollock is closer to 13 cents. A dozen seiners signed up for the first-ever pollock fishery and Keyse said he’s just waiting for the boats to show.“At this point, we are waiting for someone to approach us and say they are ready to go,” Keyes said.The Kodiak salmon season begins on June 9. Keyes said there won’t be conflicting seine gear in the water.<COL>Commercial fishing value doubles recreational sector<COL>2014-05-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/05/copper-river-readies-for-the-red-salmon-season/<COL>Copper River readies for the red salmon seasonby Laine WelchTrollers in Southeast Alaska provide fresh king salmon nearly year round, but the runs of reds and kings to the Copper River mark the “official start” of Alaska’s salmon season.On May 15 the fleet of more than 570 fishermen set out their nets on a beautiful day for the first 12 hour opener amidst the usual hype for the first fish.“We’ve got a lot of people riding around in the sky checking out the conditions, and a lot of people are getting ready to move the fish to other places for First Fish celebrations,” said Kim Ryals, executive director of the Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association.Out on the fishing grounds, it was a “very slow day, to say the least,”  according to veteran high liner Bill Webber of Cordova.“Even with the warmer environmental conditions we had this spring, I think we are in front of the run,” Webber said. “I just hope we stay on the return trend we have been enjoying in recent years. Well, it is the first period and we have to get a few more to see the trend for this year.”Prices for the first fish dipped a bit – Copper River Seafoods posted advance sockeye prices at $3.50 and $6.00 for kings; that compares to $4.00 and $6.00-$7.00, respectively, for last year’s opener.In what has become a traditional rite of spring, Alaska Airlines whisked away the first 24,000 pounds of the famous fish to Seattle where pilots traversed a red carpet to hand deliver a 48 pound king salmon to three chefs for a cook-off at Sea-Tac Airport. At least five other jets carried fresh fish from Cordova to eager buyers throughout the US, as well as to Anchorage.“This year, along with sending salmon to high end markets in Seattle and the Lower 48, the first fish also will be enjoyed closer to home,” said Kim Ryals.Several events are planned in Anchorage, she said, and fishermen also are donating salmon to a new shelter called Clare House.“It is for women and children and pregnant women over 18,” Ryals said.  “We feel like we have so much to be thankful for here in Cordova with our rich natural resources that we want to share some of these things with the people here in our own state.”A special locator app tells where Copper River salmon is being sold, and customers also can upload information. www.copperriversalmon.orgThe Copper River forecast calls for a catch of 1.8 million sockeyes and 33,000 kings this summer.SEEING RED – Red salmon from the Copper River are a unique brand that fetches an average premium of nearly $2 a pound above all other sockeye salmon in US grocery stores. The average price of “unbranded” sockeye was $10.23/lb during the past year, according to a market analysis by the Juneau-based McDowell Group. The report was done for Bristol Bay fishermen, but it covers all regions and markets.Sockeyes are by far Alaska’s most valuable salmon, typically worth about two-thirds of the total statewide salmon haul. But in terms of global supply, wild sockeye are rare creatures – they account for about 5 percent of all wild and farmed production, and represent just 15 percent of the world’s wild salmon harvest.Alaska typically accounts for 70 percent or more of global sockeye production, with nearly half of that coming from Bristol Bay. The U.S. is the single largest market, purchasing nearly 44 percent by value in 2012.  Japan and the U.K. are next, followed by Canada.The McDowell report said it will be increasingly important to defend the Alaska sockeye brand from “craft” farmed salmon producers.  Niche producers, such as Verlasso and Skuna Bay have a big advantage because they can offer fresh salmon on a year-round basis. The high end fish farmers also message their salmon as being sustainable, environmentally friendly and “harmoniously raised.”Alaska’s sockeye salmon catch this year is projected at nearly 34 million fish, five million more than last year.  Average statewide price last year was $1.60, an increase of 30 cents from 2012.Going grey – As older fishermen retire from the business, fewer young people are recruiting in.  The average age of Alaska permit holders is 47 — and there are twice as many permit holders aged 45 to 60 as there are between 30 and 44.  The issue – dubbed the Graying of the Fleet – has been discussed for years.  Now an ambitious project is underway to find ways to overcome the obstacles facing young recruits.Armed with a $335,000 grant from the North Pacific Research Board, a multi-year project is underway to focus on young fishermen in the Bristol Bay and Kodiak regions.“We are really going to be diving into some of the  factors that allow young people to be successful and what motivates them to stay in the business, and what are some of the challenges and solutions to make it easier for young people to live, work and be successful as fishing business owners,” said Kelly Harrell, director of the Alaska Marine Conservation Council who has teamed with Alaska Sea Grant for the project.The “Graying of the Fleet” project will include interviews with permit holders, processors and other stakeholders in an attempt to come up recommendations. It will be completed in August 2016.Weed power!  “When the tide is out, the table is set” is an Alaska Native saying.  Now scientists at North Carolina State University have found that seaweeds commonly found in waters and beaches near Sitka are packed with compounds that can protect against obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.The researchers said there is nothing on grocery shelves that can compare to the levels of antioxidants and other healthy compounds seen in Alaska seaweeds, which have to be really tough to withstand strong tides and temperatures. That results in ‘more bang for your buck,’ and the Alaska seaweeds  produce much stronger chemical defenses than commercially grown fruits and vegetables.In a presentation at a biology conference in San Diego last week, lead seaweed scientist Joshua Kellogg showed how the high levels of  “bioactive  phytochemicals” in Alaska seaweeds appear to combat the chronic inflammation that causes obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

Lisa Murkowski speaks out against genetically engineered salmon being sold without a label stating such.If genetically modified salmon gets a green light by the federal government, it will be labeled as such if U.S. Senators on both sides of the aisle have their way.The Senate Appropriations Committee last week passed the bipartisan Murkowski-Begich amendment requiring that consumers be advised of what they are buying.During testimony, Sen. Murkowski questioned if the so-called “Frankenfish” can even be called a real salmon.“This takes a transgenic Atlantic salmon egg, which has genes from an ocean pout that is somewhat akin to an eel, and it combines with the genes of a Chinook salmon. I have questioned time and time again, why we would want to be messing with Mother Nature like this,” Murkowski said.  “We are trying to invent a species that would grow quicker to out-compete our wild stocks. This experiment puts at risk the health of our fisheries not only in Alaska, but throughout the Pacific Northwest.”“We’re not talking about GM corn or something else that is grown. We are talking about a species that moves, migrates and breeds,” Murkowski stressed. “This is an experiment that — if it went wrong — could be devastating to the wild, healthy stocks that our farmers of the sea depend upon.”The “AquaAdvantage” Frankenfish, created by a company called AquaBounty that is based in the U.S. and Panama, has been vying for Food and Drug Administration approval for two decades. The company has spent nearly $80 million on what would be the first genetically engineered animal ever to be approved for human consumption. Because the gene tweaking is considered a “veterinary procedure,” the fish will not be required to use any labeling identifying it as a man-made product.Murkowski pointed out that more than 1.5 million people have written in opposition to FDA approval and 65 supermarkets (including Safeway, Kroger, Whole Foods, Trader Joes and Target) have pledged not to carry it. Salmon farmers also are distancing themselves from Frankenfish; both the International Salmon Farmers Association and the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance have issued statements in opposition to GM salmon.AquaBounty CEO Ronald Stotish called critics of the fish “bullies” and “terrorists” in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek article last week.Senator Murkowski said, “We are not doing anything more than telling the FDA if you move forward with a wrongheaded decision to allow for the first time ever this genetically engineered salmon for human consumption, at a bare minimum you’ve got to stick a label on it that says so.”Senator Jeff Merkly, a Democrat from Oregon, agreed.“Whether we look at this from the viewpoint of a citizen’s right to know what they’re buying, or we look at it from the viewpoint of ensuring a healthy industry that’s so important to our states, this amendment is absolutely 100 percent right on,” Merkly said. “And if you buy salmon, you should buy 100 percent salmon.”Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland and chair of the Appropriations Committee, added, “If something is a GMO food, we ought to know what it is. I don’t want to eat a Dolly-burger and I don’t want to eat a Frankenfish.”A voice vote on the Murkowski-Begich amendment passed with only one dissenter. It now goes to the Senate floor as part of the agriculture spending bill.Words matterWhoever represents Alaska in Congress needs to be seafood savvy, as nearly 85 percent of Alaska’s total harvests fall under federal jurisdiction; meaning in waters from three to 200 miles offshore.That’s a lot of poundage hauled aboard, but when it comes to fish delivered to the docks, state waters win the day. And the difference between “volume” and “landings” is often confused.“You can imagine the number of deliveries, for example, that happen in Bristol Bay in the month of July; every setnetter and every drift gillnetter who is pitching off fish, that’s a delivery, a landing. And there are hundreds of those happening every day. But you contrast that with the volume or poundage of fish harvested, that’s another thing,” explained Kurt Iverson, the Research and Planning project leader at the state Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.Likewise, there is an important distinction between fishery poundage and values. Some are high-volume with relatively lower value on a per pound basis, and vice versa.“A good example of a fishery that has very high value but relatively low volume is sablefish,” Iverson said. “Compare that to other fisheries and the total poundage harvested may not measure up, but the value is very high.”Furthermore, when people talk about the overall value of Alaska’s fisheries, they use the exvessel, or dockside numbers. But that represents only 40 percent of what it is really worth; it’s the first wholesale value that gives a more accurate number after the first fish sales are made by seafood processors.Iverson said fisheries terms can easily be misconstrued and it is important to make distinctions.“Not only for someone who is expressing it, but for a reader. Are you considering a value or poundage or a harvest, a delivery or something else?” he said. “We all have a responsibility to be clear about what we’re talking about, and our audiences should be aware that there are differences.”Shell shocksThe shells of crabs, shrimp, lobsters and other crustaceans are being turned into bio-plastics for food packaging and more. The shells contain a compound called chitin, which is also found in insects and fungi, and it is one of the most abundant biodegradable materials in the world. Estimates say more than 25 billion tons of chitin from seafood is disposed of each year.Bankrolled by funds from their government, scientists at the Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research are turning chitin into so called “active” packaging aimed at reducing plastics made from petro-chemicals. The products can range from hard bio-plastics to thin films that cover food products. The food sector alone, including beverages, accounts for nearly two-thirds of global packaging from non-biodegradable plastics.Chitin has a rich research history for use in agriculture, medicine and other fields. As a seed treatment added to soil, it works as a bio-pesticide, increases blooms in plants and extends the life of cut flowers and Christmas trees. The U.S. Forest Service has conducted research on chitin to control pathogens in pine trees and increase resin pitch outflow which naturally resists pine beetle infestation.Chitin also can be used in water filtration, as it causes fine sediment particles to bind together. Tests show that chitin combined with sand filtration removes up to 99 percenty of turbidity in water.Chitin’s hemostatic properties cause blood to clot rapidly and it is used in bandages by the U.S. and the U.K. military.Scientists also have recently developed a polyurethane coating that heals its own scratches. When added to traditional coatings to protect paint on cars, for example, the chitin reacts chemically to ultra violet light and smoothes scratches in less than one hour.Crossing the barAlaska lost one of its finest fishery writers with the untimely death last week of Bob Tkacz. Bob covered seafood industry issues in Juneau for 33 years and published the weekly Laws for the Sea during the legislative sessions. He was well-known (and feared) for asking tough questions, having the facts at his fingertips, and tenaciously demanding answers.As one pol put it, “Bob was someone you wanted covering the other guy’s press conference.”Bob was a friend and mentor for 25 years and saying he will be missed is an understatement.<COL>Senators want ‘Frankenfish’ labeled ‘genetically engineered’<COL>2014-06-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/05/demand-steady-for-halibut-and-sablefish/<COL>Demand steady for halibut and sablefishby Laine WelchThe basic laws of supply and demand are resulting in a nice pay day for Alaska halibut and sablefish harvesters.  Prices for both fish are up by more than a dollar a pound compared to the same time last year.Fresh halibut has been moving smoothly and demand is steady since the fishery opened in early March, said a major Kodiak buyer, where dock prices were reported at $6 a pound for ten to 20 pounders, $6.25 for halibut weighing 20 to 40 pounds, and $6.50 for “40 ups.”At Homer and in Southeast Alaska, halibut prices have yet to drop below six bucks a pound, said local processors.  Dock prices at Homer last week ranged from $6.50 to $7.00 per pound “for very small loads.”At Southeast, after reaching a high of $6.75 at Easter, halibut prices were $6.60/$6.40 /$6.10 per pound. Processors are   reporting “strong halibut catches and lots of nice fish”.  The fresh fish is being flown out almost daily from Southeast and distributed in small lots to markets all over the US.  Alaska’s total halibut catch this year is close to 16 million pounds.The higher halibut prices are likely due to the slower pace of the fishery and less fish crossing the docks.  Just over 3.5 million pounds had been landed statewide by May 2 out of a nearly 19 million pound catch limit. Top ports for halibut landings were Seward, Homer, Petersburg and Kodiak.For sablefish, commonly called black cod, longliners are benefitting from “bare cupboards” and strong demand by buyers in Japan, where the bulk of Alaska’s catch goes. Last year, holdovers in freezers pushed prices down 40%  to the $5 to $3 per pound range, depending on fish size.Black cod is usually priced in five weights, ranging from under three pounds to over seven pounds. At Kodiak the breakout was $6.75 – $5.75 – $5.00 -$4.50 and $4.00. Sablefish prices at Homer were running between $4 and $7 a pound.    Southeast processors reported prices at $5.30 to $7 a pound at the docks.  Alaska’s sablefish catch this year is about 24 million pounds. Most deliveries are going to Seward, followed by Kodiak and Homer.Snails on acid – Argue all you want about climate change – even a Toys R Us chemistry set will prove that the oceans are more acidic.  Now, a federal study is revealing its first findings on how corrosive oceans are affecting sea life – and it points to big trouble for pink salmon.NOAA announced last week the first evidence showing the high acid content in the Pacific Ocean is dissolving the shells of tiny free-swimming snails called pteropods. The tiny snails make up 45 percent of the diet of pink salmon; they also are a food source for herring and mackerel.Researchers at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab in Seattle said the percentage of   pteropods with corroded shells has doubled in near shore areas since the pre-industrial era.  Study co-author William Peterson said scientists did not expect to see pteropods being affected to this extent for several decades.  The number of snails with dissolving shells is likely to triple by 2050, he said, when   waters close to shore are projected to be 70 percent more corrosive.The problem stems from carbon dioxide being released into the air by human industry that is absorbed by the ocean and becomes carbolic acid.   When you combine the corrosion with increasing ocean temperatures, the entire marine mix is affected.“With a 10 percent increase in water temperature, which is what most people fear in terms of climate change, there would be about a 3 percent drop in mature salmon body weight,” said Bob Foy, director of the NOAA lab at Kodiak.  “On the other hand, a 10 percent drop in pteropod production would lead to about a 20 percent drop in body weight. Obviously, the system is fairly dynamic, but the loss of pteropod population would be extremely detrimental to pink salmon.”Pinks make up Alaska’s largest salmon fishery by volume and second only to sockeyes in value. Last year’s pink salmon catch was a record 219 million fish valued at $277 million at the docks.

More so, we see this as a great opportunity to introduce more people to wild Alaska salmon at a price they can afford,” Fick added.ASMI has put forward an additional $1.5 million to promote pink salmon, both at home and overseas. And while Alaska has been shifting away from lower valued canned pinks – 72 percent was canned a decade ago, compared to less than half in 2012 – now it’s looking “back to the future” with a smaller sized can.The smaller size cans also will let processors use the expanded product development tax, passed this year by the Alaska Legislature, to upgrade canning lines, many of which are from the 1950s. Alaska marketers also are targeting endurance athletes with magazine ads in Runner’s World, Bicycling and Competitor, Triathlete and others, as well as onsite promotions.The U.S. Department of Agriculture also announced in January that it would buy $20 million in canned pinks for food assistance programs. Meanwhile, the huge pink pack is moving to market, said Tom Sunderland, VP of marketing for Ocean Beauty Seafoods.“Prices haven’t crashed or anything and things are selling at an OK rate. Business looks good, so there’s absolutely no reason to panic,” Sunderland said.State figures show a tally of 2.7 million cases of canned pinks (talls); and 1.7 million cases of halves produced from the 2013 catch. That compares to 1.3 million and 55,000 cases, respectively, from 2012.The market should see some relief from a much smaller pink run this summer – the Alaska forecast calls for 75 million fish, a 67 percent decrease from last year’s humpy haul.Greenland callingA new television pilot featuring Alaska fisherman will take them half way across the world to the iceberg filled waters of Greenland. A recent classified ad in the Kodiak Daily Mirror called for the best and bravest halibut longliners, stating “Crybabies need not apply.”“We are looking for Alaska halibut fisherman that have braved the waters of Alaska and are looking for the next great challenge,” said David Casey, executive producer at Los Angeles-based Moxie Pictures. “The Greenlandic and Atlantic halibut of Greenland are much larger, and much harder to catch. You have to get right up next to the glaciers to catch them. So it is a completely different environment and we want to see if the Alaska fishermen can hack it.”Casey said in a phone interview that only three of the toughest men will be accepted for what he described as a very different halibut fishery that is “very abundant but hard to get to.”Greenland’s halibut quota this year is 55 million pounds, and fishermen average $7 per pound. The Greenland halibut is marketed in Europe; any sold in the US is known as Greenland turbot. Dock price for the Greenland halibut is around 7 dollars per pound and is marketed in Europe. Any sold in the U.S. is known as Greenland turbot.“It is a completely different fishing environment,” Casey said. “I understand that halibut is ebbing and flowing commercially in Alaska, and I know those changes are creating new opportunities elsewhere.”Filming of the pilot will start this summer. Contact is Christian Skovly at christian.skovly@gmail.com.Price check!Call salmon buyers around the state for fish prices and you’ll get widely different responses – if any at all. Prices paid to Alaska salmon fishermen depend on the region, the types of fishing gear and markets. Prices also reflect bonuses for iced fish, dock deliveries and other agreements between a buyer and seller. But finding any information during the fishing season is a challenge.“You are kind of in the dark,” said Geron Bruce, is assistant director of the state Commercial Fisheries Division. “You have to call around and talk to fishermen; sometimes our biologists know what the prices are because sometimes there are prices on fish tickets, but a lot of times there are not. And the prices are also in flux. Until the fish are actually sold at the wholesale level, you really don’t know what the price is going to be. So there’s a lot of uncertainty, and just a lack of information.Bruce added that in season price information also may not be very accurate “even if it’s showing up someplace.”“That’s one of the reasons some staff don’t like to deal with it because they know it’s not accurate, and there is no way they can actually arrive at an accurate figure. So they don’t want to be putting out information that they don’t feel they can be certain about, so they don’t do it.Besides, tracking salmon prices is not an agency priority“There are no critical decisions being made by the agency in which in season fish prices are an important piece of the information,” he said.Still, he agreed not being able to pencil in a bottom line makes it tough to run a fishing business.“ I know there are many fishermen who don’t know what they are going to get paid who are frustrated by that,” Bruce said, “but there is nothing that we can do as the Dept. of Fish and Game to alleviate that frustration.”<COL>Last year’s record catch of pink salmon sparks creativity<COL>2014-05-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/06/where-does-seafood-industry-rank-among-candidates/<COL>Where does seafood industry rank among candidates?by Laine WelchYou’ve heard it before and you’ll hear it again: The seafood industry is Alaska’s largest private employer, putting more people to work than mining, oil/gas, timber and tourism combined. The annual revenue the seafood sector contributes to state coffers is second only to Big Oil. So, where does the seafood industry rank among the major candidates running for Alaska Governor and the U.S. Senate?Here’s what a thorough look at each of their campaign websites reveals, starting with the race for governor; (in alphabetical order).Byron Mallott (Democratic candidate) only mentions fishing commercially in Southeast in the “About Byron” section. His information is available atwww.byronmallott.com/Gov. Sean Parnell (Republican, incumbent) only mentions fishing in the “Issues/Standing Against Federal Overreach” section, saying he “fought off the federal government’s attempt to implement ‘ocean zoning’ — known as marine spatial planning,” and “to protect the livelihoods of our fishing fleet in Southeast, the State of Alaska petitioned to de-list the eastern stock of Steller sea lions that had been protected by the Endangered Species Act.”www.parnell2014.com/Bill Walker (Independent candidate) has a complete section listed under “Issues/Fish Management” saying: “Having spent 30 years in Prince William Sound, I am familiar with the importance fisheries play in all aspects of the economy. Furthermore, I will protect, maintain and improve the fish, game and aquatic plant resources of the state, and manage their use and development for the well-being of the people of the state, consistent with high-sustained yield principles.”www.walkerforalaska.com/Candidates running for U.S. Senate need to be aware that nearly 85 percent of Alaska’s seafood harvests fall under federal jurisdiction.Senator Mark Begich (Democrat, incumbent) lists fishing resources under the “Priorities/Economy and Jobs” section saying: “In Alaska, fishing isn’t a hobby or a sporting event. More than 76,000 jobs in our state are directly or indirectly linked to the fishing industry. Our fisheries bring in $5 billion to our state’s economy. For us, fishing is a way of life.” Begich also mentions his ongoing fight against Frankenfish, a genetically modified salmon.www.markbegich.com/Joe Miller (Republican candidate) has no mention of fisheries on his site.http://joemiller.usDan Sullivan (Republican candidate) posts a picture of a fishing boat in the “Issues/Jobs and the Economy” section, but does not mention anything about fishing or the industry. Under “Improving Lives and Opportunities in Rural Alaska,” Sullivan says he “continues the time-honored activities of his wife Julie’s family at their fish camp on the Yukon River.” There is no mention of fish in his “Natural Resources” section.  www.sullivan2014.com/Mead Treadwell (Republican candidate) lists “fishing industry” in the “Issues” section and says, “Alaska’s fishing industry supports thousands of jobs and produces billions for our economy.”http://www.treadwellalaska.com/For candidates running for the U.S. House of Representatives,Forrest Dunbar (Democratic candidate) mentions two summers fishing commercially at Cordova. www.forrestforalaska.com/Rep. Don Young (Republican, incumbent) doesn’t appear to have a 2014 campaign web site. www.alaskansfordonyoung.comI fish, I vote!Seafood Harvesters of America is a newly launched group that has garnered coast-to-coast representation and united voice for “accountable and thriving fisheries.”“There is no national organization that only represents U.S. fishermen here in DC,” said Brett Veerhusen, a lifelong Alaskan who serves as executive director for the group. “If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu here. So it is important that we  — as fishermen  — lend our voices in a united way on key federal issues affecting fishermen.”“The ocean is bipartisan and the most important thing as fishermen is to pass down this tradition for generations. Without the fish, nothing else matters,” Veerhusen said in a phone interview.  The group is closely watching the Magnuson-Stevens Act (laws that govern U.S. fisheries) as it undergoes reauthorization this year in Congress. “We believe the act is something to be proud of,” he said. “What is working are decisions based on sound science. That is extremely important to this group. We are advocating for better stock assessments and more funding to be gathering the best science so we can have strict accountability measures and strict annual catch limits.”Veerhusen said the harvester group plans to work with the Coast Guard on new compliance requirements that could increase costs by 30-50 percent.“That’s really affecting the businessmen and women who are building new boats or doing a lot of boat work,” he explained. “We want to make sure we are coming up with a more reasonable approach that involves the fishing industry on those requirements.”Likewise, the group is tracking a discharge moratorium that is set to expire in mid-December.“If that moratorium is not extended by the EPA, vessels in Alaska and nationwide will need to get an incidental discharge permit for deck wash, Veerhusen said. “It’s already been extended for recreational vessels, but not for commercial vessels. We want to make sure there is an even playing field.”He added that ocean acidification also “is very much on the radar screen.”The seafood harvesters group has been several years in the making, and Veerhusen said response has been “overwhelmingly positive.”“A lot of people said it’s about damn time that we start coordinating and collaborating with each other,” he said. “As fishermen, we believe it is our patriotic duty to be harvesting America’s fishery resources sustainably for the public to enjoy.”www.seafoodharvesters.org/Staying stableFishing boats rock and roll, pitch, yaw, surge, sway and heave. A new iPhone app helps skippers respond to the movements as they navigate rough seas in tough weather. It is called SCraMP – for Small Craft Motion Program, and it has a variety of tools for boat operators.“There is a screen that will tell them how severe their roll motions have been, and a screen that gives them a choice of three different warning metrics on the heave, roll and fishermen can plug in numbers they feel comfortable with,” said Leigh McCue,  a professor at Virginia Tech’s Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering who created the app.McCue said stability indicators have been talked about for years, but prototypes were too bulky or expensive. After getting a Smart Phone, she realized it had all the computing power she needed, and input from fishermen helped hone the app to their needs.“Tracking roll periods came about from a conversation with a fisherman who said that, when he is sleeping in his bunk and wakes up, he counts off a roll period or two to make sure things seem  right to him. I figured it’s easy enough to have that being calculated so he can look at a screen that shows what the roll periods have been for the time he was asleep, and see if there is anything trending that he doesn’t like,” McCue said.The SCraMP app can be customized to each vessel and downloaded for free  atwww.vesseldynamics.com.<COL>Where does seafood industry rank among candidates?<COL>2014-06-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/06/ten-percent-of-worlds-coral-reefs-at-risk-of-death-by-sunscreen/<COL>Ten percent of world’s coral reefs at risk of ‘death by sunscreen’By Laine WelchUncertainty best sums up the mood as fishermen and processors await the world’s biggest sockeye salmon run at Bristol Bay. In fact, it’s being called the riskiest season in recent memory in the 2014 Sockeye Market Analysis, a biannual report done by the McDowell Group for the fishermen-run Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association.As presaged by buyer pushback at seafood trade shows earlier this year in Boston and Brussels, for the first time since 2010, the starting price for the first sockeyes from Copper River took a $0.50 per pound dip. At an average of $3.50 per pounds, it was down 13 percent for fishermen from 2013.“Probably more so than any recent year, processors are having pressure from both the buying side with more competition for fish in Bristol Bay, and on the selling side, where there is a very large sockeye forecast from the Fraser River (in British Columbia). That fishery takes place in August, well after Alaska’s sockeye fisheries are done,” said Andy Wink, Seafood Project Manager at McDowell Group.“If buyers hold off and there is a big Fraser run, it could leave Alaska processors holding some high-priced sockeye inventory,” he added. “We’ll have to wait and see what happens with wholesale prices, but in general, there are more downside risks this year.”The expected catch at Fraser River is about 10 million sockeye, but it could double that if fishermen and processors have the capacity to handle it.Of course, farmed salmon remains a big market competitor, as does this summer’s red salmon from Russia. That fish is making big inroads into markets it hasn’t been before.“It wasn’t ‘til 2013 when we really saw Russian sockeye going in any significant volume to markets outside of Japan,” Wink explained. “As our sockeyes become more expensive, Japan has been buying more from Russia. But last year, we saw Russian sockeye exports outside of Japan go up 580 percent.”On the upside, Wink said Alaska sockeye is an more popular brand, especially in the U.S.“There is still a lot of demand — especially for fresh and frozen products — and there is strong demand from salmon smokers in Europe, and a growing market in the United States. That’s really supported the entire Bristol Bay fishery over the last several years,” he said.Sockeye salmon are Alaska’s must valuable species by far, usually worth two-thirds of the total statewide harvest. The 2014 Alaska sockeye harvest is projected at 33.6 million fish; roughly 18 million of the reds should come from Bristol Bay.Find the 2014 Salmon Market Analysis atwww.bbrsda.com/Worker reliefAlaska seafood processors will soon get relief from worker shortages with the reinstatement of the J-1 Visa Summer Work/Travel Program. The J-1 program allows companies to recruit workers from outside the U.S. when they can’t find enough Alaskans or workers from the Lower 48 during the busy salmon season. The State Department dropped seafood industry workers from the J-1 program two years ago.U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich were successful in getting seafood workers added back into the J-1 Visa program. On Friday, the measure passed as part of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, and it now heads to the full Senate.Salmon skin creamA chance discovery by farmed salmon hatchery workers has spawned a line of skin care products that keep skin softer and younger looking.“Aquapreneurs” in Norway became curious several years ago after they noticed that hatchery workers who spent long hours handling salmon fry in cold seawater had softer, smoother hands.  Researchers at Norway’s University of Science and Technology discovered the skin softening component came from the enzyme zonase, found in the hatching fluid of the salmon eggs.The enzyme’s task is to digest the protein structure of the tough egg shells without harming the tiny fish. The scientists hailed this dual ability as the secret behind the beneficial properties for human skin.Now, Norway-based Aqua Bio Technology, which develops marine based ingredients for the personal care industry, has launched the zonase infused product as Aquabeautine XL. Another personal care product using salmon hatching fluid is also set to be launched at the end of the year, according to ABT’s website.http://www.aquabiotechnology.com/Death by sunscreenAll that sun block being slathered on by beachgoers around the world is causing major damage to ocean corals. A study funded by the European Commission revealed that the mix of 20 compounds used to protect skin from the harmful effects of the sun causes rapid bleaching of coral reefs.The World Trade Organization reports that 10 per cent of world tourism takes place in tropical areas, with nearly 80 million people visiting coral reefs each year. The WTO estimates that up to 6,000 tons of sun screen lotions are released into reef areas each year, and that 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs are at risk of “death by sunscreen.”While Alaska’s deep sea corals face threats from ocean acidification, they are safe from sun screens. Unlike tropical varieties, Alaska corals don’t form reefs, they grow into dense gardens and can live for hundreds of years. The waters surrounding the Aleutian Islands are believed to harbor the most abundant and diverse cold water corals in the world.<COL>Ten percent of world’s coral reefs at risk of ‘death by sunscreen’<COL>2014-06-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/07/alaska-fishing-about-a-lot-more-than-just-salmon/<COL>Alaska fishing about a lot more than just salmonby Laine WelchSalmon takes center stage in Alaska every summer, but there are plenty of other fisheries also going on all across the state.The world’s biggest sockeye salmon run is expected to surge into Bristol Bay any day, where a catch of about 17 million reds is projected. Elsewhere, the annual summer troll fishery in Southeast Alaska kicked off July 1, with a target of just over 166,000 Chinook salmon.In crab fisheries, Dungeness fishing began June 15 in Southeast, where a harvest of 2.25 million pounds is expected. The region’s golden king crab fishery will close on July 10, with a catch of about 234,000 pounds.The 6 million-pound golden king crab fishery continues along the Aleutians, while crab pots for 1 million pounds or so of Tanners are still being hauled back in the Bering Sea. Norton Sound’s red king crab fishery started June 26, with a harvest set at 382,000 pounds — down 23 percent.Trawlers are targeting pollock and cod in the Bering Sea, and the Gulf of Alaska fleet continues to make a dent in that 7 million pound quota.Halibut longliners had taken 53 percent of their 16 million pound catch limit, with just 7 million pounds to go. For sablefish, 62 percent of the nearly 24 million pound quota has been landed, with 9 million pounds remaining. Both fisheries end in November.In other fish newsSimon Kinneen of Nome has been named to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. He replaces outgoing councilmember Eric Olson. John Henderschedt was also reappointed for a Washington seat. Both terms are for three years.United Fishermen of Alaska, the nation’s largest commercial fishing trade group, has endorsed two congressional candidates.“We have put our support behind Senator Mark Begich for another term in the U.S. Senate, and we have also voted to endorse Don Young for another go-around at the U.S. House of Representatives,”  said UFA executive director Julianne Curry.UFA President Jerry McCune has also thrown his hat in the ring as a Democratic contender for Alaska’s State House, representing District 32Maritime workers wantedAlaska’s coastal economies depend on the seafood industry, and the entire state relies on ships to get goods from one place to another. Getting more Alaskans into maritime trades is the goal of a new workforce development plan released by the State Department of Labor. It’s the result of two years of collaboration by numerous industry sectors, five state agencies and university educators.For the first time, the plan breaks down maritime jobs into a unique, related workforce and identifies 23 different occupation types, ranging from fishing to research to shipbuilding.“One thing the plan really points out is how reliant our economy is on the maritime industry,” said Wanetta Ayers, Director of Business Partnerships at the Department of Workforce Development.  It is a real network of economic activity.”Right now, she said, there are not enough skilled workers to meet demand.“One of the occupations identified in the plan is machinist,” Ayers said. “There is increased automation and complexity with a lot of our seafood plants, and we need young people with those kinds of skills to keep our plants working. We need to look beyond the frontline jobs, which may make up the largest count in terms of workers, but there are good jobs in maritime and I want to see Alaskans working those occupations.”Ayers said one of the main areas of focus is helping Alaskans identify what those good, career living wage opportunities are in the maritime industry — and there are lots of them.“Mostly, it’s a factor of identifying the right pathways to get into these long-term legacy jobs in the maritime industry,” Ayers said. “They offer a livelihood that can take you through your entire life.”A new maritime workforce webpage is already online at the Department of Labor’s Workforce Development site.www.labor.alaska.gov/maritimeplan/Chinook News“Chinook News” is keeping Alaskans updated as the State seeks clues as to why numbers of king salmon are on the decline.“Right now, we are in the thick of our Chinook Salmon Research Initiative, which is a $30 million, five-year effort,” said Candice Bressler, Communications Coordinator for ADFG. “We want to make sure we share what we know and what we hope to learn with Alaskans and get the public fully engaged in the process.”As part of the effort, scientists are studying Chinook stocks from 12 main rivers from Southeast to the Yukon.“For this first newspaper edition, we wanted to introduce the major issues surrounding Chinook salmon in Alaska,” Bressler said. “We wanted to give folks an overview of what we are doing to understand the stocks, but also what we are doing to sustainably manage and rebuild Chinook in Alaska.”The colorful Chinook News is loaded with much more than science.Chinook News is available now at any ADF&G office and online atwww.adfg.alaska.gov/Bressler said the public is encouraged to email the Department directly with any questions or comments about Chinook atdfg.chinooknews@alaska.gov<COL>Alaska fishing about a lot more than just salmon<COL>2014-07-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/09/alaska-rivers-run-pink-with-humpy-salmon/<COL>Alaska rivers run ‘pink’ with humpy salmonBy Laine WelchAlaska’s 2013 salmon season has yielded the largest catch ever, and the value of the fishery is also headed for the record books.The statewide catch on Sept. 6 was nearing 265 million fish; the old record was 222 million in 2005. A bumper run of pink salmon is behind the big harvest; the mind-boggling catch was approaching 213 million fish. The previous record was 161 million pinks, also in 2005.Some boats are still out on the water, but the big pink catches have gone by, said Geron Bruce, Assistant Director for the state commercial fisheries division.Things are pretty close to being wrapped up in Prince William Sound and also at the Alaska Peninsula, where a catch of nearly eight million pinks ended a long string of disappointing seasons.“At Kodiak, they are still plugging away, but it’s very low numbers. Enough to keep a few of the die hards, but not big fishing anymore,” Bruce said.  Southeast will see one or two more pink openers, “where catches have dropped, but are still larger than in other areas.”Total salmon catches at the Panhandle topped 100 million, another record.“It’s really nice to see the whole Gulf of Alaska producing like this,” he added.It will be a few more weeks before we will know how much the 2013 catch is worth to Alaska salmon fishermen. The preliminary ex-vessel values (at the docks) will be released in October, and Bruce believes the total will top the chart.“I’m sure it will be a record. It’s just a question of how far into record territory we will be going,” Bruce said.Alaska’s highest value salmon catch was over $700 million in 1988, but that is considered a statistical outlier. Alaska salmon prices were stratospheric, with even pinks fetching nearly $1 a pound. The salmon market crashed the following year.“That never happened before and it hasn’t since. I think this year is going to be right up there with 2011, which had a value of nearly $700 million. This season will approach or exceed that,” Bruce predicted.Walmart watchJohn Sackton, editor of www.seafood.com, has been closely following progress between Alaska and Walmart as they work to make sure Alaska salmon is available to customers.He reported that 15 Walmart executives met with an Alaska delegation that included Stefanie Moreland, Governor Parnell’s fishery aide, State Commerce Commissioner Susan Bell, ADF&G’s commercial fisheries director, Jeff Regnart, Mike Cerne, executive director of ASMI, and by telephone with  representatives of  Senators  Begich and Murkowski.Sackton highlighted three important points of the meeting:First, Alaska is very important to Walmart, and the company is determined that its customers will have access to Alaska salmon for years to come.Second, under no circumstances was Walmart committed to a single eco-label. A significant part of the meeting revolved around the ways in which Alaska managed its fisheries sustainably, how the third-party RFM (Responsible Fisheries Management Certification) worked, and the chain of custody requirements, Sackton reported.Third, Walmart said next week they would respond with the next steps needed to move forward, and they were fully committed to resolving the issue so they can purchase Alaska salmon that meets their sustainability standards.Sackton added that by all accounts, “a good step forward” was taken and the outcome looks “very positive.”Weather alertMarine weather forecasts are set to change Oct. 1 for the Western Gulf of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands and Bristol Bay. The changes are intended to tighten up the wording, said James Nelson with the National Weather Service office in Anchorage.“We want to better serve our customers and not have excessive wording per weather zone, so that people can read the forecasts more easily and not get confused, especially across the marine weather radio broadcasts.” Nelson told KMXT public radio news.Two changes will occur around Kodiak Island: The “Barren Islands and Kamishak Bay Waters” will become two zones: “Barren Islands East” and  “West of the Barren Islands, including Kamishak Bay.” “Shuyak Island to Sitkinak” will change to “Marmot Bay to Sitkinak.”Nelson said the Eastern and Central Aleutians zones will be split, with separate forecasts for north and south of the islands.“The main reason we did that is due to wave height, with the chain of islands there are really stark differences between the Bering side and the Pacific side,” Nelson said.The Bristol Bay weather forecast zone will be smaller to better accommodate vessels operating near shore.“We just went specifically with Bristol Bay. Before the zone was way out into the Bering Sea and into an area where it wasn’t transited by ship traffic all that often. So we tried to get more centric about it and make sure it was just handling the Bristol Bay area,” Nelson explained.The new marine weather forecasts include eight new zones and several other name and number changes.

Most of the bump is due to optimism about the sockeye base price of $1.50/lb. — a $.50 increase from last year.Data from the State Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission shows that  Bristol Bay driftnet permit values have remained near or well over $100,000 since 2010. They have increased steadily each year after dropping below $20,000 in 2002.This summer was also a great one for salmon seiners, which has driven up interest in those fishing permits.“These folks had good seasons and made some money,” Bowen said. “They’re going to be looking to expand their operations, pick up another permit, another boat or upgrade.”Salmon seine permits at Southeast Alaska have the distinction of being the highest-priced at more than $300,000.“There’s very little on the market and it’s hard to tell where that will shake out,” said Olivia Olsen of Alaska Quota and Permits in Petersburg. “Most people think the permits are headed up because they have had such a fantastic year, but they had moved up so fast prior to the season, that might not happen.”A Chignik seine permit recently sold for $225,000, Bowen said, and Prince William Sound seine permits just broke the $200,000 mark. At Cook Inlet, seine cards are stagnant after a disappointing season, but still valued around $70,000. That compares to a Cook Inlet permit value of about $54,000 last year and just $17,000 in 2010. Kodiak seine permits are still hovering around $40,000 and interest has picked up slightly; at the Alaska Peninsula, the seine value is holding steady in the high $60s.“All of these permit prices are extremely volatile,” Bowen said. “A good fishing year or forecast can make permit prices double in a year depending on the fishery. Then, if they have a lousy year or it looks like they are heading into a bad time, you can watch permit prices tumble by 50 percent. But we are seeing a trend of better salmon prices and that has sparked enthusiasm with the fleet and buyers.”Find a list of all Alaska limited entry permit values (based on the average price of actual sales) at www.cfec.state.ak.usIFQ funkBrokers tell a far different story when it comes to sales of halibut catch shares.“In a word, it’s negative,” Bowen said, adding that it’s been the slowest time for Individual Fishing Quotas sales in the 17 years he’s been in business.Halibut catch limits have been slashed by 70 percent over the past five years and the outlook, at least for the short term, is grim. Prices at the docks also have plummeted by a dollar or more.“Buyers are understandably reluctant to purchase quota that they believe will be cut next year and sellers are faced with the difficult decision to either hold out for their price, or hold onto their quota and perhaps have less to sell next year,” Bowen explained. “That’s pretty much taken all the wind out of the sails of the IFQ market, and demand is non-existent.”The one exception is southeast Alaska, which has avoided halibut catch cuts for a few years.“Fishermen here are real happy with their catch, the numbers per skate and availability of the fish,” said Petersburg’s Olsen. “They feel like maybe there won’t be more cuts in southeast and there might be increases. So this is the only area where halibut has been moving at all this year. I have zero interest in any other area.”The price for southeast Alaska halibut shares has also “been out-of-sight,” selling between $38 to $46 per pound. “And as soon as it’s in, it’s moving,” Olsen added.Bowen said he is confident the IFQ market will rebound for other Alaska regions, as it has in southeast.“When it hit bottom there and then turned around, the optimism came back and that’s when we saw those prices take off,” he said. “So I imagine we would see the same scenario in these other areas when the cuts bottom out.”Here comes the crab!It’s mixed results for Bering Sea crab, based on the annual summer trawl surveys. For nearly 40 years, fishery managers have surveyed 360 regions to track the health and abundance of the various crab stocks.  The annual report by NOAA Fisheries, dubbed the “road map” by crabbers, shows survey hot spots and other data prior to the season opener.Some highlights: red king crab stocks at Bristol Bay appear stable. Legal males are at the highest level in four years, up nearly 40 percent since last year’s survey. Mature females, however, declined 26 percent, so chances of an increased quota are mixed. Last year’s red king crab catch was 7.8 million pounds.Catch numbers could decrease for Bering Sea snow crab; the number of legal males dropped five percent and mature females declined 20 percent. Last year, just over 66 million pounds of snow crab were harvested.The Pribilof region, which has been closed to king crab since 1999, is again unlikely to see a fishery. The surveys show the male red king crab size has been stable for four years and abundance has increased, but a decrease in mature females is cause for concern. For blue king crab, both male and female abundances are extremely low with little evidence for improving.Conversely, hair crab stocks around the Pribilofs, central Bristol Bay and west of Nunivak Island appear to be on the upswing. That fishery has been closed since 2000, but has been slowing rebounding since 2005.  Another bright note: a small fishery for Bering Sea tanners could reopen for the first time since 2010. The catches for the Bering Sea crab fisheries will be announced this month; the 2013/2014 season opens in mid-October.Puny pinksAlaska pink salmon set a record this summer, but it turns out the fish in the three major producing areas were pretty puny.  State data shows the pinks at Prince William Sound averaged 2.76 pounds, down a full pound from last year.At Southeast, pink salmon weight averaged 2.9 pounds this season, down 18 percent from the 3.77 pounds of last summer. And at Kodiak, pink salmon averaged 3.06 pounds compared to 3.58 pounds last year, a 14 percent decrease.Alaska’s pink salmon catch topped 215 million as of Sept. 13, bringing the all species total to 267.7 million salmon.<COL>Fishing permit prices remain extremely volatile<COL>2013-09-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/10/early-tallies-indicate-record-2013-salmon-catch/<COL>Early tallies indicate record 2013 salmon catchBy Laine WelchAs expected, Alaska’s 2013 salmon catch is one for the record books. Early tallies by state fishery managers show that fishermen caught 272 million salmon this summer, smashing the previous record of 221 salmon in 2005. The fishery was powered by a whopping catch of 219 million pinks.In terms of money, the preliminary harvest value of $691 ranks second to the $724 million of 1988, called an “outlier” season by salmon managers. They also predict that, once all post-season bonuses and price adjustments are determined by salmon processors, the 2013 season could be the most valuable salmon harvest in Alaska’s history.Some highlights:For the second year running, Southeast has again claimed the title for the Alaska region with the highest salmon volumes and overall value. Fishermen caught more than 100 million salmon for the first time ever, valued at nearly $220 million at the Panhandle docks.Prince William Sound fishermen ranked second with a catch of 98 million salmon, valued at $162 million. Both Southeast and PWS had their largest pink salmon harvests at just over 91 million and 89.2 million, respectively.Kodiak was third in terms of salmon catches at nearly 32 million fish, and fourth for value at $62 million.Bristol Bay is still home to Alaska’s most valuable salmon fishery, with Bay sockeyes totaling $138 million at the docks this summer.Here are the average 2013 statewide salmon prices with comparisons to last year:2013        2012Chinook:      $5.31                 $4.01Sockeye:       $1.60         $1.31Coho:            $1.08         $1.27Pink:     $  .40        $  .48Chum:     $  .52         $.  76Crabbers pay, can’t playThe Bristol Bay red king crab fishery begins Oct. 15, but the fleet is likely to miss out on the opener. The government shutdown means no one is on the job to issue the permits for the crabbers to go fishing.“It’s a situation where you not only have harm to the crab fishermen, but also to the processors in the area. Think of the economic impact because you don’t have somebody in an agency who is there to pick up the phone, and sign the piece of paper to issue the harvest limits. Nothing can happen,” fumed Senator Lisa Murkowski in a phone call from her Washington, D.C. office.Speaking of fuming, the bureaucratic delay could cause crabbers to miss critical sales deadlines to Japanese buyers.“Even if they come on-line on Friday, we are going to be cutting it close to getting everything done by the November beginning of the season,” said Jake Jacobsen of the Inter-cooperative Exchange.The Exchange represents crabbers who hold more than 70 percent of the Bering Sea crab shares.“If it drags on another few days, we’ll start chewing our fingernails down to nothing,” Jacobsen said, adding that the  delay could cost the crab fleet $5 million or more.What is most galling is that the harvesters and processors have already covered the costs for management and enforcement of the Bering Sea crab fisheries.“We paid a three-percent user fee, split with the processors, to cover all of this,” said Mike Woodley, skipper of the F/V Atlantico.That is the message Senator Murkowski and Representative Don Young brought to the Commerce Secretary in a letter last week.“We reminded her that the Bering Sea crab fisheries are funded by a tax on the users’ landings, not by the government,” Murkowski said. “It’s a situation where it pays for itself, so you don’t need to wait around for a budget.”The crab user fees added up to $262 million last year, according to NOAA data.Murkowski and Rep. Young have asked the Secretary to intervene and added, “We are aware that other federal agencies have used available balances from prior years to continue essential operations, and we believe such flexibility should be applied to the crab fishery, and in a timely manner.”Meanwhile, the crabbers’ Jacobsen offered this quick solution:“We would be happy to pay NMFS employees 10 times what they would normally make to come in and work for a few days and issue the IFQs.”Murkowski off the cuffThe Senator admitted D.C. is a tough place to be during these days of budget shutdowns and showdowns.“There’s a heck of a lot more talking going on, so that’s positive,” Murkowski said.“It is Republicans who are taking the biggest hit in the polls for the government shutdown across the nation,” I said.Murkowski agreed, but countered with the unpopularity of Congress as a whole, which Gallup has at 8 percent; the lowest rating in its polling history.“A PPP poll showed we, as a Congress, have a lower approval rating than dog poop, toenail fungus, cockroaches and the IRS,” the Senator quipped. “We do have a higher rating than Putin and hemorrhoids, and we beat out the Ebola virus and also Charles Manson by a long shot. We also have higher ratings than Honey Boo Boo, but lower ratings than pot holes.”“It’s all so ridiculous,” she sighed. “You have to be able to laugh a little bit. It’s sort of like laughing through your tears.”Fishermen get healthierEnrollment began this month for the Affordable Care Act, which lets people sign up for health care coverage that fits their budgets and needs. Individuals and families can choose from many options through a Marketplace, regardless of pre-existing conditions or non-coverage. The Act requires Americans to have coverage by Jan. 1 and provides tax credits for some individuals to help pay for it.Fishermen, who are usually regarded as self-employed or independent contractors, have long fallen through the health care cracks due to the high costs and high risks associated with their profession. Fishing organizations and support businesses also are likely eligible for tax credits under the ACA, said Mark Vinsel, executive administrator for United Fishermen of Alaska.“I think some of our own UFA member groups are likely to be eligible for tax credits even as nonprofits, as well as other small industry-related businesses, like boat repair, marine services and many others,” he said.Find more information about the Affordable Care Act at the United Fishermen of Alaska web site or www.healthcare.gov.<COL>Early tallies indicate record 2013 salmon catch<COL>2013-10-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/10/government-shutdown-could-stall-crabbing-season/<COL>Government shutdown could stall crabbing seasonBy Laine WelchKodiak’s waterfront is bedecked with hundreds of “7 bys” as boats stack their pots and gear up for the big crab fisheries in the Bering Sea.The Bristol Bay red king crab season is set to open Oct. 15, with a harvest of 8.6 million pounds, similar to last year. A reopened Tanner crab fishery will produce a 3-million pound catch; the numbers for Bering Sea snow crab, Alaska’s largest crab fishery, will be out next week.The fisheries are set to open on schedule, said Heather Fitch, regional manager for ADF&G at Dutch Harbor. However, due to the government shutdown, the season could be stalled because crabbers won’t know how much each boat can catch. The Bering Sea crab fisheries operate under a catch share system and the federal number crunchers who compute who gets what are off the job.Nearly 500 eligible vessels and companies have applied for 2013/2014 crab quota, said market expert John Sackton. Furthermore, the crab fishery depends on a share-matching system between the harvesters and processors. That cannot be determined until the exact amounts of quota for each shareholder is determined by NOAA Fisheries.The agency “does not have the manpower” to process applications and issue federal fishing licenses, said Alaska region director Jim Balsiger at the North Pacific Council meeting this week in Anchorage. Balsiger said he was appealing to the Commerce Department to make personnel available.Alaska’s red king crab fishery is “highly dependent on year-end sales to Japan, and this crab has to be landed, processed and shipped generally by the third week in November. If the season is delayed even by a week, that could impact the ability to fulfill the Japanese orders,” Sackton said.Shellfish learn ‘n slurpShellfish growers will gather in Ketchikan later this month to update the state of Alaska’s mariculture industry. There are 69 shellfish farm sites in Alaska so far; 28 are operational, growing mostly oysters with sales topping a half million dollars last year.Dominating the growers’ agenda this year is the seed crisis for future crops.“The crisis is caused by ocean acidification in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon and Washington, where farmers get the predominant amount of seed for shellfish aquaculture on the west coast,” said Ray Ralonde, a Sea Grant aquaculture specialist in Alaska for more than 35 years. “The upwelling of deeper water is more acidic, and because of that, the larvae and juvenile seed can’t develop shells.”“It has happened at a terrible time, because we are really on the cusp of moving ahead in a hurry; especially since 2012, when we got appropriations for a revolving-loan fund,” RaLonde said. “We have the technologies, the brood stock, multiple species, decades of research and economic studies and the markets.”Some Washington shellfish farmers are setting up shop in Hawaii, where the oceans are less corrosive. Alaska is also starting to produce its own seed sources at facilities in Ketchikan, Homer and Seward.Blue mussels are poised to be the next big thing in Alaska mariculture, based on the ongoing success of a demo project at Kachemak Bay near Homer. All of Alaska’s shellfish farms are located in the Central and Southeast regions. RaLonde said he is often asked about possibilities in Western Alaska.The problem is, it’s hard to work in an information vacuum,” he said. “With shellfish, temperature has an enormous impact on growth. We would have to do preliminary studies on focused locations to see what impact that would have on the ability to produce shellfish in a timely way.”It takes 18 months to two years for Southeast grown oysters to reach market size and up to four years at Kachemak Bay — due to colder waters.RaLonde will lead a daylong workshop on Oct. 24, followed by the famous shellfish feast that evening. The Alaska Shellfish Growers meetings are Oct. 25 -26. All events are at the Cape Fox Lodge in Ketchikan. Questions? Contact ray.ralonde@alaska.eduFish watchSome fisheries underway in October include the dive fisheries in Southeast Alaska (sea cucumbers, geoduck clams, spot prawns and Dungeness crab.)No red king crab fishery at the Panhandle again this year due to low stock numbers. Alaska’s halibut fleet has taken 86 percent of its 22-million-pound catch limit, with just over 3 million pounds remaining.For sablefish, the catch was at 83 percent of the 28-million-pound quota. Both fisheries end on Nov. 7. Only a handful of pot boats were fishing for cod in the Gulf, compared to 35 vessels last year. Fishermen cited low prices and high expenses for the lack of interest; most said there just isn’t any cod out there.<COL>Government shutdown could stall crabbing season<COL>2013-10-08<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/10/governor-answers-alaskans-questions-on-natural-resources/<COL>Governor answers Alaskans’ questions on natural resourcesBy Laine WelchGovernor Parnell took to the statewide airwaves last Tuesday to answer questions from Alaskans on APRN’s Talk of Alaska.Of fishing interest: A Cook Inlet set netter asked about his stance on the proposed Chuitna coal mine in Cook Inlet that would set a precedent by removing, among other things, 11 miles of salmon streams.“Didn’t you say you would never trade one resource for another?” she queried.“And I won’t,” Parnell responded. “I’ve seen the written misinformation about Chuitna and the decision that was made on a proposal to basically stop any permitting and stop any activity,” he added. “There has been no decision made to allow the mine to go forward. Certainly, a company can work the permitting process and the public process, but until such time as that’s allowed to play out … I don’t know what else to say except that my job is to make sure the public has access to that process, that they have input, that the science is there and then that the department makes a good decision. And we are not anywhere close to that at this point.”On reserving water rights to protect salmon streams, the governor said that’s “an important one.”“We are the only state in the union that allows a private party to tie up water from other parties,” he said. “And the only way I think to constitutionally have a process where everybody has a say in the water, is for a government entity to hold those water reservations and not private entities. So that’s one of the reasons we moved forward with legislation to accomplish that.”On Anglo-American pulling out of the Pebble Mine project, “What message does that send to other investors?” a caller asked.“Well, it certainly sends a message that, at least in the case of Pebble, a company is going to have a struggle even getting into the permitting process,” Parnell responded. “And that means there will be less investment in Alaska in that kind of activity. Of course I am concerned when that happens because it has spillover into smaller areas and other industries. But we are where we are right now and I cannot invest time and effort on a Pebble permitting process when there isn’t a company to come forward. So that’s where I’ve left it at this point.”A Sitka caller asked the governor if the State has a monitoring system in place for the continuing radioactive threat that is coming from the leaking Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan.“We do, and it is something that the Dept. of Environmental Conservation is watching closely, along with federal agencies including NOAA and the EPA,” he said. “So far in our biological testing of fish, we have seen no evidence of that, and our federal government contemporaries — including the military, Homeland Security and Defense organizations that look over this. They have indicated they have not seen environmental contamination in the fish that are returning to Alaska. So it is an ongoing monitoring effort with our state and federal agencies, but it is not something that has posed a risk to date.”Wild salmon watchThe statewide harvests for Alaska’s 2014 salmon season are pretty much tallied up, with a total approaching an all-time high of 270 million fish. (That compares to 124 million salmon harvested last year.)Southeast Alaska salmon fishermen set a record this summer, topping 100 million fish for the first time ever. Second-highest for salmon catches is Prince William Sound at 94 million, followed by Kodiak at nearly 32 million salmon. Bristol Bay comes in fourth at 16.6 million fish. Rounding out the top five is the Alaska Peninsula, with just over 12 million salmon caught this summer.Now the values of the various catches are trickling in from regional managers.At Bristol Bay, the all-species harvest of 16.4 million fish has a preliminary ex-vessel value (at the docks) of $141 million; that’s 26 percent above the 20-year average and ranks seventh over that same period.The sockeye salmon fishery value is listed at more than $138 million. The estimates do not include upcoming price adjustments and bonuses, which will drive the values much higher.At Kotzebue, 66 salmon fishermen had the best chum catch since 1988, and the 10th highest in history. The chum price averaged $.27, down 15 percent. The 319,062 chum catch was worth $689,163 at the docks, 16 percent higher than the historical average. That meant a payday of $10,442 to participating fishermen.Southeast Alaska will likely be tops again for the most valuable salmon fishery overall. Reports on the salmon values by region and average prices paid to fishermen will be out in October.Fish meetingsAlaskans will get a first glimpse at proposed pollock, cod and other groundfish catches for next year when the North Pacific Fishery Management Council meets Oct. 2-8 at the Anchorage Hilton. The NPFMC oversees fisheries in federal waters of the Gulf and Bering Sea, which produce more than 80 percent of Alaska’s seafood landings.

Skippers of the 80 boats estimated the extra time tied up in Dutch Harbor cost them each $1,000 per day.Meanwhile, the situation was even worse for small boat crabbers at Kodiak and the Westward region, who learned there would not even be a Tanner fishery come January.“It is not unexpected,” said Mark Stichert, a shellfish biologist at Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Kodiak. “We’ve been seeing a decline in abundance of legal sized or mature male Tanner crab for the last couple of years.”The closure affects Tanner crab fisheries at Kodiak, Chignik and the South Peninsula. Stichert said the stocks have seemed to follow an up and down pattern since the late 1990s.“Beginning in 2006/2007, we saw large recruitment of juvenile Tanner crab, and those crab subsequently matured into the population and into the commercial fishery beginning in 2009 through 2011,” Stichert said.  “We had a couple of pretty large years and now those crab are aging out of the population. That’s what has led the decline and resulted in closures for next year.”Those years produced region-wide catches of three to more than four million pounds; last January the harvest was less than one million pounds. The mid-January fishery is worth several million dollars to the coastal communities. Up to 40 Kodiak boats dropped pots for Tanners and 25 at the Peninsula during the 2013 season. Chignik has been closed for two years.Looking ahead, Stichert said there is a mix of good and bad news.“The bad news is we aren’t seeing any kind of continued recruitment in the near future for legal sized male crab. However, during the 2013 survey we just wrapped up, we did observe a fairly large pulse of juvenile crab in all three areas,” he explained. “So the good news is, the total number of crab in the water seems to be well above average. In fact, it seems to be one of the larger sizes of recruitment of juvenile crab we have seen in 10 or 15 years.”Those Tanners are two to three years out from maturity and lots can happen between now and then.“It’s definitely a bummer,” said Kodiak fisherman Tyler O’Brien. “Tanner crab is a nice shot in the arm for the smaller boats in the winter.”Kodiak’s resident processing workforce will also feel the pinch of no crab coming into town.Diving for dollarsSea cucumbers are a popular delicacy dotting soups and salads throughout Asia. Right now 150 divers in Southeast Alaska are competing for a robust 1.5 million-pound cuke harvest.“It’s actually the highest quota since 2000,” said Mike Donnellan, lead diver for ADF&G at Juneau.Last year, the divers got nearly $5 for the one pound, red sea cucumbers plucked from the sea floor. That made the fishery worth $7.5 million at the panhandle docks. ?Kodiak is the only other Alaska region where a cucumber fishery occurs, albeit far smaller at 140,000 pounds. The 26 divers there are fetching $3.50 per pound for sea cukes; two dollars less than last yearRegardless, Lance Parker has dive-fished in Kodiak since 1986 and says it is — by far — his favorite fishery. ?  “Everything I’ve done has been profitable and a blast, because the things I’ve gotten to see I wouldn’t trade for anything,” Parker said. “I think I have dived in every bay on this island for one thing or another, and the variety of bottom type and the surprises that you always see, there is always something to spice up the experience.”Parker said a good day for him is diving around 35 to 50 feet, sometimes as long as eight to nine hours, day or night, plucking as many as 2,000 cucumbers per dive.Jobs jump startStudents at the Southwest Alaska Vocational and Education Center (SAVEC) at King Salmon are getting on a training fast-track, thanks to a funding boost by local stakeholders.The Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation made a nearly $195,000 donation to fund a wide range of SAVEC training programs through December. Programs include everything from crane and small boat operation, to CPR and first aid certification, to marine safety instructors.The funds will help leverage a $405,000 USDA Rural Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge grant received in August by the Bristol Bay Native Association. It is the first of its kind awarded to a Native organization.SAVEC was founded in 2002 as a nonprofit organization to provide career and workforce development training to the residents of Bristol Bay and rural residents from around the state.<COL>Bering Sea crabbers get late start, Tanner crab fishery closes<COL>2013-10-22<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2014/06/wild-and-farmed-salmon-prices-show-seasonal-variations/<COL>Wild and farmed salmon prices show seasonal variationsby Laine WelchSalmon prices at wholesale show marked seasonal variations for both wild and farmed fish. It’s a pattern that has been tracked for decades by Urner Barry, the nation’s oldest commodity market watcher in business since 1895. Prices tend to decline through June, July, August and September, and they begin rising again from November through the following April or May.Two things drive the well-established pattern, said market expert John Sackton, who publishes Seafood.com, an Urner-Barry partner.“There’s a growth cycle for farmed salmon when they eat more and grow faster at certain times of the year, and so the harvests — particularly those that come into the U.S. market from Chile, for example — really peak in June, July and August, which are our summer months and the winter months in Chile,” Sackton explained.  “Then there is the opening of the wild salmon season each summer, and all of a sudden you get a lot more diversity and availability of Alaska salmon.”A big wild card for North American salmon this summer is the projected 72 million sockeye return at British Columbia’s Fraser River. Sackton said Japanese buyers have been somewhat priced out of the sockeye market in recent years because there has been so much demand elsewhere. A drop in the yen has made it harder for them to buy, but they are hoping that a big run will open up more opportunities for them.Timing also will come into play, as the Fraser River run typically arrives in August, several weeks after the big sockeye haul at Bristol Bay.Fish WatchThe first week of June saw salmon fisheries opening across the state, and the streak of warm weather had fish showing up earlier than usual. Bristol Bay’s season officially opened June 2, and fishermen and processors are gearing up in anticipation of an early sockeye run.No one wants a repeat of last year, when reds arrived eight days sooner than expected and caught many off guard.Alaska’s total salmon harvest this season is projected around 133 million fish — down 47 percent from last year’s record catch of 283 million fish.  That’s due to an off year for pink salmon; this summer’s catch of 75 million is a 67 percent decrease from last summer’s record take of 226 million humpies. The breakdown for other catches call for a 14 percent bump up in sockeyes to nearly 34 million; 4.4 million coho salmon, and nearly 20 million chums. A total catch of 79,000 Chinook salmon is projected in areas outside of Southeast and Bristol Bay.You can track Alaska salmon catches by region and species on a daily basis with ADF&G’s “Blue Sheet.” Find it under Commercial Fisheries/Salmon/Harvest. A weekly in-season summary also charts the progression of all commercial salmon harvests and compares them with the five-year averages.The summer pollock season opened in the Bering Sea June 10. Likewise, cod reopens for hook and line catcher processors. Halibut longliners have landed 45 percent of their 16 million-pound catch limit with the ports of Homer, Seward and Kodiak getting almost equal shares of landings so far.For sablefish, 54 percent were taken out of a nearly 24 million-pound quota, with most deliveries going to Seward. Jig fishermen around Kodiak were still tapping away at their 7.3 million-pound cod quota.Fascinating ugly fishOne of Alaska’s ugliest and most abundant fish — the giant grenadier — is set to be tracked for the first time by federal managers. Also called rat tails, there are several species of the deep dwellers and little is known about their life history.Trawl surveys by NOAA Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska have shown that grenadiers are the most abundant fish, in terms of weight, in depths from 600-3,000 feet and have been caught deeper than 6,000 feet. The fish are most commonly taken as bycatch in the sablefish longline and Greenland turbot fisheries.  Sketchy catch data estimates that 16,000 metric tons (35.2 million pounds) of grenadiers are discarded. Their mortality rates run at 100 percent, due to the pressure difference experienced by the fish when they are brought to the surface.“There really is not a lot known on their niche in the ecosystem, but just the fact that they are so abundant, they likely have a large impact on other species on the slope,” said Cara Rodgveller, a biologist at the Auke Bay Laboratory in Juneau. “They are most likely feeding off both fish and invertebrates, and also as a prey species for other fish.”There have been attempts to develop a fishery for giant grenadier, but because of their jelly-like flesh quality, high-water content and low-fat levels, there has been little interest in world markets. Likewise, endeavors to develop treatment processes to make the fish palatable have been unsuccessful.Federal fishery managers in February included grenadiers in their oversight as an “ecosystem component” in Alaska waters. That means they will be tracked for overfishing officially, and their retained catch is required to be reported, Rodgveller said.And while there is no directed fishery for the grenadiers, which can reach lengths topping six feet, genetic research continues to learn more about the fish. In aging studies, scientists discovered that the otoliths (ear bones) were variable in shape, unheard of within a species.“Giant grenadiers have the potential to actually be more than one species,” Rodgveller said. “They have different otolith shapes that are dramatically different, and haven’t been seen in any other fish species.”<COL>Wild and farmed salmon prices show seasonal variations<COL>2014-06-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2013/11/dutch-harbor-ranked-nations-top-fishing-port-for-16th-year-2/<COL>Dutch Harbor ranked nation’s top fishing port for 16th yearby Laine WelchFor the 16th year in a row, Dutch Harbor ranked as the nation’s top fishing port with 752 million pounds crossing those docks last year. The catch was valued at $214 million.The No. 2 port for landings again was Empire-Venice, La. The Aleutian Islands jumped to third place with 456 million pounds, led by deliveries to Akutan, and bumped Kodiak to No. 4 with 393 million pounds landed in 2012.In all, 13 Alaska ports made the Top 50 list for poundage, according to the annual Fisheries of the United States report by NOAA Fisheries.For value of catch, New Bedford, Mass. retained the lead for the 13t- consecutive year at $411 million, thanks to pricey scallops; Dutch Harbor ranked second, followed by Kodiak at $170 million and the Aleutian Islands with a dockside value of $119 million.In all, U.S. seafood landings totaled 9.6 billion pounds last year, valued at $5.1 billion, down 2.2 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, from 2011.Other highlights:Alaska topped all other states for total landings at 5.3 billion pounds and for overall value at $1.7 billion. Alaska provided 55.5 percent of all seafood landed in the U.S. last year. The top five fish species landed by volume were pollock, menhaden, cod, flatfish and salmon.For value, the crabs category ranked first, followed by scallops, shrimp, salmon and lobster. Pollock and cod were sixth and seventh for value. Shellfish prices dropped by 3 percent, while prices for industrial products, such as oils and feeds, increased by 14 percent.Dockside prices increased for 18 out of 32 species groups being tracked, and decreased for 14 species. The skipjack tuna price index had the largest gain, up 112 percent, while sockeye salmon showed the largest decrease at 17 percent.The average dock price paid to fishermen in 2012 was 53 cents per pound, compared to 54 cents the previous year. U.S. consumers spent about $82.6 billion for fishery products in 2012. The U.S. fishing industry contributed $42 billion to the GNP.Americans ate less seafood last year at 14.4 pounds per person, compared to 15 pounds in 2011. The decrease resulted primarily from a drop in the domestic landings utilized for food, the report said.Other Alaska ports on the Top 50 list include the Alaska Peninsula at  No. 9, Naknek at No. 14, Cordova at No. 15, Ketchikan at No. 18, Sitka at No. 20, Bristol Bay at No. 22, Seward at No. 23, Petersburg at No. 24, Kenai at No.31and Juneau at No. 42 for seafood landings in 2012.Feedback from fishermen wantedInput by mariners is wanted on plans being considered for a bigger boat haul-out and other waterfront development at Sitka’s Sawmill Cove Industrial Park.“We’ve been hearing from the community for years that they would like to see our haul-out capabilities expanded and our marine services expanded bit,” said Garry White, executive director of the Sitka Economic Development Association.“Currently, the largest haul-out we have in town is an 88-ton lift, and we are hearing from a lot of the fleet — especially the tender boats and some of the larger vessels — that they can’t be hauled out here in town,” White added. “The fleet has to go elsewhere to get serviced, and they would like to stay here in town to get that done.”To get feedback from boat owners, the association has launched a Sitka Marine Industry Development Survey.“The first thing we’re interested in is what size haul-out we should put in to meet the fleet’s needs, and what other services are needed, such as sand blasting, bottom painting and diesel work,” White explained. “A lot of those industries exist here in town, but we are trying to figure out how we can broaden things to meet all our needs at the same time.”Sitka’s commercial fishing fleet is the largest in Southeast Alaska at  631 registered vessels.

Those trips produced an estimated 601 metric tons of directly observed discards in the directed halibut, sablefish and Pacific cod fisheries.When that tonnage and the observer rate are extrapolated over the entire fleet, the discards add up to more than 20 million pounds of halibut, nearly 3 million pounds of cod and 5 million pounds of skates.“That is not necessarily mortality, it is fish going over the rails,” Merrill explained.The new catch-and-discard data could eventually result in new fishery management plans and bycatch caps, Merrill said. Any changes are a few years away.“This is a brand new program for us,” he said. “I think we feel confident with the data, but it’s always nice to have at least a year or two of information under your belt before you start making decisions about future management. But ultimately, it could.”Find links to the NPFMC observer documents at www.alaskafishradio.comHalt to halibutIt’s all over for this year’s halibut fishery; the eight-month season ended Nov. 7 — a week earlier than usual.Early numbers show there was more than a million pounds left of the nearly 22-million-pound harvest.Kodiak processors called the season “scratchy,” and fishermen seemed to agree.  ? “As a whole, it was kind of slow fishing,” said Rick Turvey, skipper of the F/V Big Blue. “There are fish out there, they are just harder to get and they don’t seem like they are getting big. There are a lot of small fish.”Prices to Kodiak fishermen averaged about $4.50 for the season, but closed as high as $5.65. Fishing was better down on the panhandle, with one Petersburg buyer calling it “very good; historically good.”A dollar drop in price also helped keep the market moving more steadily, after some early push back from buyers to the high-priced fish. That, combined with overall lower halibut catches, have cleaned out any back logs in freezers.The first peek at what next year’s catches might be like will be revealed in early December by the  International Pacific Halibut Commission. The fishery reopens in March 2014.Expo growsPacific Marine Expo, (Fish Expo to most Alaskans) is one of the nation’s top 50 fastest-growing trade shows. And it has expanded again this year!“We’re at 492 companies displaying products in 69,000 sq. feet and that’s up from a little over 400 companies and 65,000 sq. feet last year,” said show director Bob Callahan, speaking of space at the CenturyLink Field Event Center in Seattle. “We have exhibitors from 14 foreign countries and 107 brand new companies on the show floor.”Last year, a scheduling conflict forced Expo to change its dates from weekend to mid-week.“We were concerned about it, but it worked out so well that we have kept the mid-week dates based on feedback from exhibitors, visitors and our advisory board,” Callahan said. “It was overwhelmingly positive, “Expo is celebrating its 47th year, and Callahan credits its success to the direct contacts and networking a trade show provides.“Plus it’s a learning environment – you can see what your competitors are doing, attend free education sessions and interact with your peers.” Callahan said. “You can’t get that from the Internet. We think the trade show model is healthy and here-to-stay.”Pacific Marine Expo is Nov. 20-22 in Seattle.   www.pacificmarineexpo.comFish bucks give backAmerican Seafoods Company is again calling for applications for its Community Grants program.

It’s a sure sign that the economic chaos on Wall Street has trickled down to the docks.  The global credit crunch is stalling or stopping seafood commerce, and cod is piling up in local freezers.“There’s just so much uncertainty,” said John Whiddon, manager at Island Seafoods.“It’s scary,” echoed Tuck Bonney, operations manager at Alaska Pacific Seafood.Like so many others, the seafood industry depends upon a long chain of buying and selling to carry out its business.“Processors buy from fishermen, who then sell to wholesalers who sell to retailers and so on. When things are working normally, a line of credit is a standard part of the business. And many of these companies have been doing business together for decades,” said Gunnar Knapp, fisheries economist at the University of Alaska/Anchorage.If anyone along the chain runs into a credit glitch, it gums up the whole works.“What it boils down to,” Knapp said, “is that businesses are finding it a lot harder to borrow money on credit, partly because the businesses who lend out the money are experiencing difficulties. Money is short and they are extra cautious about who they want to lend to.”Currency exchange rates are also getting whacked around worldwide. That’s important to watch because seafood accounts for fully half of Alaska’s total exports.“You need to consider where in the world it is going,” Knapp said.In just the past few months, for example, the value of the Euro has tanked while the Japanese yen has strengthened. That’s lucky timing for Alaska crabbers, as Japan bought 65 percent of the red king crab pack this winter.“This is a global economic crisis and many of Alaska’s competitors may have the same or worse credit and market problems. To the extent they are unable to supply markets, this could benefit the Alaska industry,” Knapp speculated.The global recession could reduce demand for higher priced seafoods, and boost interest in less pricey products. Fishermen should also get a break from high fuel prices over the next few months.“Fishing is always an uncertain business,” Knapp said. “Diversification in the kinds of fisheries we are involved in as a state, and among processors and fishermen, is usually a good strategy, and that is certainly the case right now.”Brokers are busyBrokers who buy/sell/trade fishing permits and quota shares say business is pretty good for this time of year. Spring is their busiest trading season, and already the mood is good going into next summer.“People are optimistic about salmon right now. I really think they are,” said Paul Piercey at Dock Street Brokers in Seattle.The hottest ticket right now is any salmon permits at Prince William Sound. Seine permits that went for around $35,000 last year have traded as high as $125,000. Drift gillnet permits, which had been holding steady at $50-$55,000, jumped even more, said Doug Bowen at Alaska Boats and Permits in Homer.“They have really shot up,” he said. “The last one we’re aware of sold for $130,000. So they’ve almost quadrupled just since last year.”Dock Street’s Piercey cautioned that it only takes a couple of buyers to create   a perception of the market.“Because word travels so fast through the fishing fleets, one person can pay a high price and everyone thinks that’s the new market,” Piercey said.Bowen said Area M (False Pass/Aleutian Peninsula) drift permits were ranging from $90,000-$110,00  and he has seen “renewed interest” in Kodiak seine permits, which were trading at around $25,000,  “up considerably from a few years ago.”On the down side, salmon permits at Bristol Bay have dipped to around $80,000, roughly a $10,000 drop from the spring.“The forecast for next year is down a bit, and I think folks just had a tough time making a go of it this past season, with the fish prices and fuel prices going in opposite directions,” Bowen said.Bowen said business is a bit slower in the halibut IFQ market, and blames the recession for the stall in trading. Still, quota shares of halibut have trended upward in value in the last few years, holding steady at $25-$30 per pound in prime Alaska fishing regions. And dock prices hovering near $5 per pound at major ports still attract a lot of ‘tire kickers’ for halibut Q’s.The fact that nearly all of Alaska’s sablefish (black cod) goes to Japan has strengthened that IFQ market, Bowen said.“A weaker dollar against the yen helps us there, and it pushed up quota prices for black cod to new highs this year – up to $19 per pound for some shares in the Central Gulf,” Bowen said.Dock Street is the go-to shop for crab quota, and harvester shares of red king crab were trading at about $26 per pound; snow crab quota was averaging $10-$11 per pound Tanner crab shares were trading at $10.50 per pound, and $8 per pound for golden king crab.Piercey said he believes those prices are likely to hold.“All things staying the same, I think the market is pretty comfortable at where the prices are. People look at the multiple of ex-vessel (dock) price to the price per pound to buy quota, and that’s pretty attractive right now ($5 per pound). There’s no where else you can put your money that you’d do as well as with crab right now.”Despite concerns about the struggling economy, both brokers said overall, their business outlook is good.“There’s always something going on – catch quotas go up in one area or another, fish prices go up and down. It’s never dull in this business,” Bowen said.“People are still fishing and making transactions and making plans for next year, lots of stuff is going on now,” Piercey said. “And banks have called to tell us that they are still very much in the market to make fishing loans. Fishing has been a bright spot on their portfolios and they want to do more of it.”<COL>Economic woes trickle to docks<COL>2008-12-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/10/fewer-crab-equals-higher-price/<COL>Fewer crab equals higher priceAn eager market will be competing for reduced supplies of king crab this winter and that is likely to boost prices for fishermen.A fleet of about 86 boats is on its way to the Bering Sea this week for the Oct. 15 start of king and Tanner crab fisheries. For Alaska’s largest king crab fishery at Bristol Bay, crabbers will drop pots for a total catch of 20.36 million pounds of red king crab, compared to 20.38 million pounds last year. Ten percent comes off the top for the CDQ (Community Development Quota) allocation, designed to help the economies of remote western Alaska communities that border the Bering Sea.While U.S. king crab buyers might be tightening their belts due to the sluggish economy, that’s not the case for Alaska’s number one customer: Japan. According to market analyst Ken Talley of Seafood Trend, demand for Alaska king crab is strong in Japan and that should be reflected in higher prices. Imports of frozen crab into Japan through June dropped 27 percent from a year ago, and average wholesale prices increased by 41.5 percent on a per-pound basis.Retail sales are key to the king crab market in the U.S. and reduced supplies have pushed up wholesale prices by nearly 40 percent for imported product (primarily from Russia). Talley said some major U.S. buyers may forego king crab until after the prime holiday sales season when prices may soften.Alaska crabbers have proposed an opening price of $5.15 per lb for red king crab, according to market expert John Sackton of Seafood.com. That compares to of $4.35 per lb last year.  Fishermen receive a base price and then a final adjustment after the crab is sold.Alaska crabbers compete with Russia and Norway in world markets and fishermen there also are negotiating for higher prices this year.In other crab news, the catch quota for Bering Sea snow crab (opilio Tanner) is reduced by 7 percent to 58.5 million pounds, compared to 63 million pounds last season. The harvest for bairdi Tanners, the larger cousin of snow crab, also decreased to 4.3 million pounds, a reduction of 23%. There will again be no fisheries for king crab at the Pribilofs and at St. Matthew Island, although blue king crab stocks there are on a slow but steady rebound.Celebrate Seafood MonthOctober is National Seafood Month – a distinction proclaimed by Congress a quarter century ago to recognize one of our nation’s oldest industries. Government figures show that nationwide, the seafood industry provides more than 250,000 jobs and contributes $60 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Alaska deserves special merit during Seafood Month, as it produces over half of our nation’s seafood – more than all the other states combined. For 19 years in a row, Dutch harbor has ranked as the nation’s number one port for seafood landings.  The seafood industry is Alaska ‘s number one private employer. It ranks second only to Big Oil for the tax dollars it pumps into state coffers.More fish facts: Americans eat just over 16 pounds of seafood per person each year. (Compared to 63 pounds of beef.)  America’s seafood favorites have remained largely the same for five years:  shrimp, canned tuna, salmon, pollock and tilapia. The nation’s seafood appetite is being fed mostly by foreign imports- nearly 80 percent of all fish and shellfish eaten in the U.S. comes from other countries.Speaking of other countries  – that 16 pounds of seafood that Americans eat pales when compared to other parts of the world.  The Japanese, for example, eat 146 pounds of seafood per person each year. U.N. figures show that in Greenland, it’s 186 pounds and 200 pounds per person in Iceland. The country with the lowest per capita seafood consumption is Afghanistan at zero.And where in the world do people eat the most fish? The South Pacific islands of Tokelau, where each person eats more than 440 pounds of seafood every year.Expo goes GreenThe first Green Industrial Business and Career Expo is set for October 10 at the Puget Sound Industrial Excellence Center. Generating electricity from geothermal energy is a main topic and will include a presentation by Bernie Karl of the Chena Hot Springs Resort. The Expo also includes workshops where industrial firms can learn about energy efficiency, how to reduce emissions, and "green collar" jobs of the future.  Sponsors include the Seattle Office of Economic Development, Seattle Community College District, the National Wildlife Federation and the Manufacturing Industrial Council of Seattle. www.nwgreenexpo.org.Pacific Marine Expo will take place Nov. 20-22 at the Qwest Center in Seattle. The event features four tracks: safety, workboat, fisheries/fisheries business and charter boats.

Now, there is even more exciting news – oyster fats, called ceramides, appear to fight breast cancer.When oyster ceramides were introduced to breast cancer cells in lab tests, the fats appear to fight the cancer by blocking the blood supply to the tumor and preventing it from growing.“It’s sort of a fancy way of saying it starves the tumor off,” said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute.  “The body of evidence is leading researchers toward the conclusion that ceramides are a successful agent in fighting cancer.”The research was done on lab rats as part of a Sea Grant project at Louisiana State University. The LSU researchers also found that oyster fats used in clinical trials helps speed the healing process for patients undergoing chemotherapy.The LSU work is an example of how seriously researchers are regarding the role that foods play in cancer prevention.“We’ve known for a long time that oysters are a food rich in iron and good fats. It’s only now that we are beginning to see their full potential to fight disease,” said NFI dietitian Jennifer Wilmes.News of the emerging research comes amid National Breast Cancer Awareness Month (and National Seafood Month). According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women.Back to libido – research chemists in Miami and Naples, Italy discovered last year that raw oysters, mussels and clams contain two unique amino acids that prompt the release of sexual hormones. Oysters also are loaded with zinc, a key nutrient for testosterone production in both men and women.In Alaska, roughly 50 oyster growers operate farms in Southeast and South central regions.  In all, they produce about one million oysters each year.“They could triple production and not keep up with the demand all year,” said Rodger Painter of the Alaska Shellfish Growers Association.Candidates hook endorsements – Alaska fishing groups came out strongly in an endorsement of Sen. Ted Stevens. United Fishermen of Alaska is the nation’s largest fishing group, and its 37 membership groups represent nearly every fishery, from small salmon setnetters to huge Bering Sea catcher/processors and crabbers.  UFA gave its endorsement last week to candidates vying for seats in nearly all of Alaska’s house and senate districts,  as well as national offices. The votes are made via roll call and a two-thirds majority must prevail, said UFA executive director Mark Vinsel.“Nobody has done more for fisheries in the North Pacific in our lifetime than Sen. Stevens, and we will continue to recognize that,” Vinsel said.UFA did not endorse either of the two candidates vying for Alaska’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives – namely, Republican Don Young, who has held the seat for more than 35 years, or Democratic challenger, Ethan Berkowitz.“We interviewed both candidates and both have some support on the UFA board, but neither was able to garner the two-thirds support level needed,” Vinsel explained.Likewise, UFA did not endorse either of the presidential candidates.“No, UFA has never made an endorsement in a presidential election,” Vinsel said.UFA is encouraged that there seems to be more recognition by state policy makers of the important role the fishing industry makes to Alaska, Vinsel said.  The first issue UFA will be addressing when the Alaska legislature convenes in mid-January is energy and fuel prices for fishing operations.  UFA will also work to expand eligibility for the state engine retrofit loan program.   (www.ufa-fish.org)Halibut surveys take on water – Starting next year, annual surveys of halibut stocks will also monitor ocean conditions from Oregon to the farthest reaches of the Bering Sea. The expanded assessments are made possible by a $500,000 federal grant by NOAA Fisheries.‘We are very excited,” said Bruce Leaman, director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission. “We have tried for this funding for 8 years because we have this incredible density of survey stations.”  The IPHC has had oversight of U.S. and Canada halibut stocks since 1923.The money will be used to purchase 14 ocean profiler systems on IPHC survey vessels, Leaman said.“We have about 1,200 stations that we occupy every year and it represents an incredible opportunity for observations of the ocean. And since we already have the platforms out there in the form of our survey vessels, I think NOAA was convinced that it was a good investment,” Leaman said.The survey system that has long been used for stock assessments ties in perfectly with water column profiling, he added.“Samples will include data on florescence, which is essentially chlorophyll production and pH (acidity), temperature depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen. We will be using that to characterize the environment for halibut, but the information will also go into the national ocean data base so it is readily available to all other ocean and fisheries researchers,” Leaman said.The ocean profile and halibut stock surveys will be conducted from June through August, and the first data will be available next fall.Got fish? The Alaska Chapter of the American Fisheries Society will hold its annual meeting in Anchorage October 26 – 30 at the Anchorage Hilton..  The meeting will be attended by fisheries scientists and other professionals from all over Alaska. Papers and presentations will be of interest to sport fishermen, commercial fishermen, subsistence harvesters, resource developers, and the seafood industry.  Registration is open to anyone.

Another snag comes from a threat by “a very small claimant group that is unhappy with their share,” Ott said.“They are having it reviewed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and we are waiting for that outcome. In the meantime, they might throw in an objection to any authorization for distribution to the rest of the claimants until they say their share has been confirmed or changed,” he explained.“At this stage, the distribution allows for the remaining plaintiffs to receive their portion of the shares, and the objector’s portion can be put in a reserve fund until their issue is resolved,” Ott said. “In the meantime, the court has to give process whenever something is filed in court, so there may be a delay of 30 days or so until that ruling occurs.  It is a fairly minor issue, but it does eat up a little bit of time.”Whenever the plaintiffs do get their settlements, they will also get some tax relief as part of the $700 billion bail out package passed last week by Congress. It will allow plaintiffs to income-average their awards over three years, contribute up to $100,000 to retirement plans, and exempt payments of self employment or payroll taxes on any Exxon awards.“We recognize that waiting 19 years to get settlements from Exxon is tough enough, but having to turn a good portion over to Uncle Sam is adding insult to injury. And the timing of this in allowing for some tax relief is just about perfect,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who pushed through the tax relief measure along with Sen. Ted Stevens.Sen. Murkowski said in a phone interview that she was not happy to vote for the massive Wall Street bail out package, but she felt it was necessary to provide a financial assist to U.S. credit markets.“Having the Exxon tax relief included made it a bit easier to swallow,” she said.Exxon is appealing an additional $488 million in interest payments on the damages award, and the tax breaks will also apply to that settlement..“That is now on a briefing schedule with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and they may come out with a ruling by year’s end, but more likely in early 2009,” said attorney Ott.Fish  fizzles – A bill by aimed at giving U.S. fishermen a fuel tax break failed to get the nod from Congress this session. The two year measure would give fishermen an extra tax deduction based on the difference between fuel prices paid on Labor Day 2004, adjusted for inflation, and prices paid this year.“The finance committee was faced with so many different bills that the fuel tax relief bill simply didn’t rise to the top of the stack.” Sen. Murkowski said.“I do intend to see what I can do in the next Congress to introduce legislation that would again provide relief to fishermen, whether in the form of fuel assistance, or maybe some kind of consideration if you work, for example, to retrofit an engine.”The nation’s financial crisis derailed many other bills, including one that would allow fishermen to obtain low cost operating loans through the Farm Bill.Likewise, efforts failed again to get the U.S. to sign on to the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty. This year the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Norway and Russia adopted a ‘declaration of cooperation’ in the Arctic, which supports the Treaty as the legal framework for governance.  But without ratification, the U.S. remains sidelined while the other nations stake claims to oil, gas, fisheries and other resources in the Arctic.One measure that did move forward was the Bush Administration’s push to permit offshore fish farms using converted oil and gas platforms in U.S. waters. That was advanced through the rule making process and tagged on to an energy bill as a way to sidestep Congressional hearings.“What they were doing was kind of back door to get offshore aquaculture moving because we have not advance that bill in the way they wanted. And  I don’t appreciate that at all,” said Sen. Murkowski. “My office has been very vocal in letting folks know that there is a process that needs to be followed, and if not, you can expect strenuous opposition. I am very concerned about this and we are not going to let it get away from us.”The Minerals Management Service has scheduled offshore fish farm public meetings on the West Coast next year and Murkowski said she is insisting that Alaska is included.Diving for dollars – October marks the start of dive fisheries for sea cucumbers, geoduck clams and urchins.“These are pretty hard core fishermen diving in the winter weather in the Gulf of Alaska. But for a lot of these guys it’s an important piece to their overall annual fishing livelihood,” said fishery manager Nick Sagalkin at Kodiak.About 14 local divers compete for 140,000 pounds of cukes around Kodiak; smaller fisheries occur at Chignik and along the Alaska Peninsula.Southeast Alaska boasts the biggest dive fisheries – 175 divers are targeting more than one million pounds of sea cucumbers, valued at over $2.50/lb. Divers can also scoop up 5.4 million pounds of sea urchins, valued at about 33 cents a pound. Giant geoduck clams are the most lucrative dive fishery, and this year’s quota is 869,000 pounds. The clams, which can weigh up to 10 pounds, fetch $3.50-$3.90/lb if live, and less than $1 if processed. About 60 divers are on the grounds, said regional manager Bill Donaldson. The combined dive fisheries were valued at $7 million at the Southeast docks last year.Also in Southeast each October: spot prawn and coon stripe shrimp fisheries, fall Dungeness crab, and the winter troll fishery reopens for 45,000 king salmon.“Similar to Kodiak, more and more you get salmon fishermen who also do dive fisheries or shrimp or something in the fall,” Donaldson said. “Fishermen have diversified and they fish a portfolio of different fisheries.”<COL>The checks in the mail<COL>2008-10-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/07/fish-factor/<COL>Fish Factor• Congress tinkers with fish rulesFishermen are seeing red flags as Congress retools the rules that will govern the U.S. Coast Guard through 2012.The USCG Act that was passed by the U.S. House (HR 2830) contains business busters for fishing operations, mostly in the form of new licensing, inspection and reporting requirements for even the smallest boats. The bill now passes to the U.S. Senate.“It would require survival craft on any commercial fishing vessel, even seine skiffs. That doesn’t make sense,” said Mark Vinsel, executive director of United Fishermen of Alaska, representing 37 fishing groups.“We’ve got fishing vessels registered in Alaska as small as 7 feet, and more than 2,000 that are 20 feet or under,” Vinsel said. “The breadth of the different fisheries in Alaska does not necessarily match the Coast Guard’s idea of what they are trying to regulate, and the safety they are trying to ensure for fishermen.”The U.S. Fishing Industry Safety Advisory Committee recommends that the USCG assess “risk by fishery”, instead of using a blanket approach. The committee is chaired by Jerry Dzugan, director of the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association in Sitka.That boat’s got classAlso included in the USCG Act – a new “classification” for fishing boats.“That’s something usually applied to cargo ships and tankers and cruise ships, not fishing boats,” said UFA president Joe Childers. “That’s a process that very few in the fishing industry have heard of.”Classed means a vessel has been examined by, for example, the American Shipping Society, Childers explained.“They look at its structural integrity, its ability to maintain power, propulsion systems, dewatering devices, navigation equipment, the deck machinery, basically, everything on the vessel,” he said.Initially the classification requirements will hit boats 50? or greater. Smaller vessels are exempted until 2018. At that time, all vessels that are 25 years or older would also require classification.“Were this to go into effect, I believe you’d find a lot of boats fishing today in Alaska and elsewhere would be obsolete,” Childers said.The USCG estimates 80,000 commercial fishing boats are operating in the U.S.Hose thisBy September, any water running off the decks will be considered “incidental discharge” – if the Clean Boating Act (S. 2766) gets the nod from Congress.“Hosing off your recreational or fishing boat would be subject to EPA regulation and permitting. We don’t think this makes sense,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, adding it also applies to bilge water, cooling water and ballast discharges.All recreational boaters are lined up to get a pass on the EPA permits, but not America’s small fishing boats. Murkowski is taking heat from the huge sport boat lobby for holding up the bill last week.“We’ve got some 9,700 vessels in the Alaska fleet, predominately small boats with an average length of 36 feet. I think it is absolutely appropriate that if we exclude recreational vessels, as I believe that we should, that it is reasonable to also provide for permit relief for the smaller commercial vessels,” she said in a phone interview.Murkowski objected last week to a request from Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to pass by unanimous consent an exemption for all recreational boaters from the EPA permit, and tried unsuccessfully to expand the same break to commercial fishing boats.“The inequity of a small 36 foot seiner possibly being subject to these regulations and then you look at the 414-foot yacht that (MicroSoft co-founder) Paul Allen owns … under the Nelson Boxer bill, that vessel would be wholly exempt, whereas our little seiner would be subject to regulation and permitting and potential fines and sanctions – it simply doesn’t make any sense,” Sen. Murkowski fumed.U.S. fishing boats 125 feet or less would be exempt from the new regulations under Murkowski’s proposal. But so far, Senator Boxer has refused to budge.“As a matter of fact, 13 million boaters are going to wake up very unhappy in the morning if Sen. Murkowski objects to this bill,” Boxer said in a press release, calling it a “delicate compromise.”The Marine Exchange of Alaska calls it “a nightmare for anyone who operates a watercraft, from a 950-foot container ship to a 14-foot outboard.” A federal court has ruled the EPA must finalize the permitting process by Sept. 30.Offshore Fish FlashA proposed rule was quietly published last week in the Federal Register that opens the door for offshore fish farms in U.S. waters. By going through the rule making process, the Bush administration can sidestep Congressional debate and approval. The deep sea farms will make use of existing oil and gas platforms from three to 200 miles off the nation’s coasts.A comprehensive energy bill passed by Congress in 2005 gives the Minerals Management Service the authority to regulate alternate projects, such as fish farms, on offshore platforms, said SeaFood Business. The Minerals Management Service will accept public comment on the proposed rule for 60 days and hopes to finalize the new rule by the end of the year.<COL>Fish Factor<COL>2008-07-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/10/a-million-pounds-of-trash/<COL>A million pounds of trashMarine debris clean up efforts in Alaska reached a milestone this year.The Juneau-based MCA Foundation removed over one million pounds of debris from Alaska’s 34,000 miles of shoreline since its program began in 2003.“People ask how much is a million pounds?  Think of it as getting four 747 cargo planes full of trash off the beach. It’s a lot of junk and a real accomplishment,” said program coordinator Bob King, adding that the group picked up almost 150 metric tons of trash this year alone.The Foundation has partnered with more than a dozen groups and communities to pick up debris from the Panhandle to points far west.“We had clean ups this year in Juneau, Prince William Sound, Sitka, Kodiak, the Pribilof Islands, Aleutian Islands, Bristol Bay, Shelikof Strait, Yakutat and Port Heiden.“We had one of our biggest projects in Norton Sound,” King said. “We pulled almost 100,000 pounds of trash off of St. Lawrence Island with crews from Gambell and Savoonga hired by the Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation. And on top of that, they picked up another 20,000 pounds off of Golovin.”One innovative partner is the Alaska Brewing Company which provides ‘brew crews’ and donates one percent of its Alaskan IPA sales to a program called the Coastal CODE (Clean Oceans Depend on Everyone).The marine debris in Alaska differs from other places in the nation, King said, where 60 percent comes from land based sources, such as beach litter or urban storm drains. A whopping 30 percent is cigarette butts and other smoking related trash.  In Alaska, it is mostly fishing related – but not necessarily from Alaska fishing operations.“There has been intensive fishing going on in the Bering Sea for over 50 years,   and there also are currents that bring over a lot of debris from Asia. So many of the nets picked up are scraps from old high seas drift nets, and trawl nets that are not a type used by our domestic industry,” King explained.Disposal varies depending on the location, King said, as certain communities have landfill capacity but many in rural Alaska do not.“We are working with some recyclers in the Seattle area and the Port of Seattle has been very helpful in putting together a program where fishermen can drop off their old nets and have them disposed of for free or at a low cost,” King said.The MCA Foundation has so far invested about $1 million in Alaska clean up projects, most of which comes from federal funds as part of a nationwide effort.“It’s hard work, but it is so gratifying to see the improvements to the shoreline, and also to reduce the threats to marine mammals, sea birds and fish,” King said.Despite the accomplishment of removing one million pounds from Alaska’s shoreline beach, “there is still a lot more out there and it continues to come in which is very troubling,” King said. “But more people are realizing that marine debris is a huge problem and we are committed to continuing this clean up effort in the years to come.”Fishery protections- Amid the growing chant of ‘drill, baby, drill,’ one of the first areas that could be affected in 2011 is the nation’s ‘fish basket’ – the nearly 6 million acres of the North Aleutian Basin, including the Southeast Bering Sea and Bristol Bay. The region yields 40 percent of the nation’s wild seafood harvests, worth more than half a billion dollars to Alaska fishermen.“The biggest red crab fishery happens there, it’s the catcher vessel operations area, it’s the halibut nursery grounds for the area and the major migratory salmon area,” said Joe Childers, president of United Fishermen of Alaska which represents 37 fishing groups.UFA is not opposed to oil and gas development, but worries that it poses big threats to Alaska’s fishing industry. The group has created an official position that claims Alaska’s seafood production is an integral part of our national food supply, and needs to be protected.“We think of our operations as part of the national security equation, as well as the oil and gas that might come out of there. And we feel that our property rights to our fisheries are not protected at all,” Childers said. “In a lease sale, the oil companies are very likely to wind up with something akin to a property right and we would just be forced to move. We find that very threatening.”Childers, who grew up fishing at Cook Inlet, said by its very nature, oil and gas development takes over traditional fishing areas.“It involves putting in rigid physical structures, seismic testing, laying pipeline,” he said. “In every case, it is most likely that fishing activity will be changed, impaired or forced to move.”Childers said UFA believes the Alaska fishing industry should be granted the same considerations as local boroughs.“If there is going to be drilling, we want to require that a Regional Citizens Advisory Council be established immediately, and funded by the oil companies,” Childers said.UFA also calls for, among other things, creation of a disaster fund to provide compensation to the fishing industry and coastal communities in the event of disruption of fisheries; research on the potential impacts of oil/gas development to seafood markets; and long term scientific monitoring to assess impacts to fisheries and the marine environment.National chairman Arni Thomson, director of the Alaska Crab Coalition, said he believes UFA’s position paper “has significant implications for all other U.S. states facing offshore oil development.”   (ufa1@ufa-fish.org)Fuel tips survey extended – Fishermen are sharing energy saving fuel tips and questions   through Oct. 31.

The salmon item is one of 17 “never before” baby foods and beverages being launched by Beech Nut Nutrition Corp. The new line emphasizes different ingredients based on the time of day the meals are fed to children.“There’s been a lot of surprise over salmon in baby food, but the response has all been positive. I think its time has come, finally,” said Bob Harvey, director of Research and Development at Beech Nut’s manufacturing plant in Canajoharie, NY, where it has operated for more than 75 years.Harvey pushed the idea of a sweet potato/salmon blend at Beech Nut nearly 20 years ago, but “couldn’t get it past the marketing folks.” Similarly, past attempts by Gerber to use fish in U.S. baby foods failed to make it past the “gate keepers,” meaning mostly mid-west parents, said former spokesperson Nancy Lindner. That bias has long been reflected in America’s baby food aisles, where you’ll find wide assortments of beef, pork, and chicken products, but no fish of any kind.Today, omega 3 fatty acids from fish are widely accepted as important parts of a healthy diet, Harvey said. For babies especially, omega’s support brain and eye development, and fish as a lean protein promotes good digestion.“This new baby food means they’ll get the right omega-3 fats and all the health benefits of eating sustainable, wild-caught Alaska seafood,” said Laura Fleming of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.“Beech Nut took the big step forward as the major manufacturer in putting it out there,” said Bob Pawlowski, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. AFDF, in partnership with University of Alaska Fish Tech/ Kodiak has championed the salmon baby food project for about four years. The project received $460,000 in U.S. Dept. of Agriculture funds aimed at developing alternative uses for Alaska salmon.Beech Nut’s new parent company — Hero Group of Switzerland — has a line of baby seafoods in Europe, and was quick to make the Alaska connection.The new baby food uses Alaska pink salmon processed to Beech Nut’s strict specifications by Ocean Beauty Seafoods. The boneless/skinless pinks are minced, frozen into blocks and sent to Beech Nut, where the salmon is blended into the final product.“This is a superb example of the creative new Alaska seafood products being developed to meet the needs of today’s time-pressed, health-conscious consumers, particularly families with young children,” said ASMI’s Fleming.If America’s babies get hooked on wild salmon, Bob Harvey said Beech-Nut will likely add to the catch.“If the salmon is successful, I imagine we’ll add at least one, maybe three or four more fish products,” Harvey saidBeech Nut has baby food products at 66 percent of America’s grocery stores and hopes to expand to 80 to 90 percent with its new product lines, said vice president of marketing Dennis Warner.

And, driven by abundance-based dictates of the U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty, chinook catches in Southeast Alaska will be cut in half to just 170,000 fish. Southeast hatcheries will add an additional 20,000-40,000 kings to the harvest“We dropped below a million kings for the entire North American harvest last year, so it will be interesting again this year,” said market analyst Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Group.There are three major king salmon fisheries in North America: the west coast states of Washington, Oregon and California, B.C. Canada and all the Alaska fisheries combined.King salmon harvests topped 2 million fish just a few years ago and built a huge following by upscale retailers and restaurants. When the fish started to get scarce in 2006, demand pushed dock prices for Alaska troll-caught winter kings to $10 a pound.“Part of what drove the prices so high for us in 2006 and 2007 was a good deal of unmet demand from all of these strong harvests in the earlier part of the decade. The problem with unmet demand is that it only goes unmet for so long before it goes somewhere else,” McDowell said.High-end markets will always pay top prices for winter kings — which last week were retailing at $32.95 a pound in Seattle and $26 in Juneau.“It’s really impressive, but that only represents 10,000 fish for the entire winter starting in October. It doesn’t reflect the broader market,” McDowell said. “The real question is what the price will be in June and July. That’s when we produce nearly all of our volumes for kings.”King salmon from Bristol Bay could make up some of the unmet demand in the market. A catch of 85,000 king salmon is projected at Bristol Bay this year.“The question is —is there enough market interest for buyers to come in and pay a price that is sufficient to generate more fishing effort? McDowell said.Bristol Bay fishermen averaged 54 cents a pound for king salmon in 2007. Only Norton Sound was lower at 53 cents.The average statewide king salmon price for 2007 was $2.68 per pound. Although Chinook salmon represent between 1-1.5 percent of Alaska’s total salmon harvest, the fish provide six to eight percent of the value. Last year’s catch of 526,000 king salmon weighed in at 8.6 million pounds, and was worth $23 million at the Alaska docks.<COL>Wild Alaska salmon is ‘what’s for dinner’ for America’s babies<COL>2008-04-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/11/salmon-permits-adjust-upward/<COL>Salmon permits adjust upwardby Laine WelchAlaska salmon permit values are ticking upward, along with the price of fish. The trend is especially notable at Bristol Bay, home to the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery. The Bay accounts for one third of Alaska’s total salmon earnings, and holds the most salmon permits at more than 2,800 fishermen.“There’s been a gradual improvement over the past two or three years. It indicates that things are looking more positive all the time,” said broker Mike Painter at Permit Master. “People had a decent season and expectations of a higher sockeye price (62 cents). When that didn’t happen, interest in permits kind of died off and dropped as low as $85,000.”If an anticipated final sockeye price of 80 cents holds true, (up from 66 cents last year), Painter predicts it will push up permit prices.“If there is an adjustment paid, that could push permit prices closer to $90,000,” he said.Olivia Olsen at Alaskan Quota and Permits in Petersburg agrees there’s an upswing in Bristol Bay.“At the end of the season, we sold three in a row –bam-bam-bam! – at $87,000,” Olsen said. “Now people are relisting at  $90,000 and $100,000 and speculating that’s where it is going to be.”It’s a far cry from the hey days of the 1980s, when Bristol Bay drift permits fetched highs of $275,000. The all-time low was $16,000 just a few years ago. Painter said prices for Bristol Bay setnet permits have doubled over the past three years, from $12,000 to $25,000.“It’s not like it used to be and probably never will be, but it’s getting better all the time. It’s nice to see some health and optimism back in the industry again. It was pretty much gone five years ago,” he said.“Generally throughout the state, everything is up from two or three years ago and everyone is optimistic that the salmon industry is finally turned around,” echoed Olsen.Painter credits “improved quality and permit stacking,” (being able to fish two permits on one boat), for helping to boost Bristol Bay permit values. He said buying interest is split “about 50/50” between the Lower 48 and resident Alaska fishermen.Both brokers said there is renewed interest in Alaska roe herring permits. Roe on kelp pound permits in Southeast regions are especially in demand.Shifting to quota sharesPrices approaching $5 a pound at the docks have boosted the value of halibut quota shares to unheard of levels — and brokers predict they’ll continue to climb.“It’s been a very strong seller’s market for a couple of years and very little quota is available. So the old supply and demand theory has kicked in and pushed up the price,” said Olivia Olsen.Halibut quota in prime areas of the Central Gulf was fetching $27 per pound, said Permit Master’s Mike Painter, and he expects the price will go higher.“Reasonably priced is not a term that’s used anymore. The asking price for next year’s quota is at $30 and even that doesn’t look unrealistic,” he said.Olsen said quota shares are running between $18.50 to $26 per pound in Southeast Alaska. Southeast used to be the price leader, but uncertainties about the fishery have prices running about $2 below the Central Gulf.“Southeast seems to have the greatest charter impact than any other areas, and there’s a big cloud out there about what’s going to happen and lots of speculation,” Olsen said.Halibut quota prices in the Western Gulf are listed at $14 – $22 per pound, and at $12 – $20 for Bering Sea waters along the Aleutian Islands.The brokers said there also is strong demand and high prices for sablefish quota, with prices at $15-$16.50 for Southeast and slightly lower elsewhere in Alaska.Crab quotasBering Sea crab is the newest entry into the quota share market. Similar to Alaska halibut and sablefish, catches of king and Tanner crab have been split among participants into shares based on their fishing histories.But unlike transactions in halibut and sablefish fisheries, which involve thousands of participants, crab quotas involve far fewer players and transactions. That makes for a more tricky market, said Jeff Osborn at Dock Street Brokers.“With crab, the transfers and sales are infrequent enough that it is hard to establish exactly what the market is,” he explained.Osborn said red king crab quota is priced between $28-$30 per pound (southern district). Opilio (snow crab) is a little tough to call because of next year’s significant catch increase, “but it’s in the $9-$10 per pound range,” he said.Quota for bairdi Tanner crab is priced closer to $12 per pound, and shares of golden king crab in the western region of the Bering Sea range from $7.50-$12 per pound.Looking ahead, Osborn predicts the market for crab quota will continue to be tough to track.Osborn said future catch limits, grounds prices and uncertain political developments will dictate the ups and downs in the Bering Sea crab quota market.Wild salmon sperm spawns first  bio-LEDs: Light emitting diodes, (LED), are found everywhere. They light up the numbers in digital clocks and in all kinds of gadgets and electronic equipment. Now, scientists have discovered that LEDs can be intensified by using biological materials – notably, salmon sperm.Dr. Andrew Steckl is a leading expert in photonics, based at the University of Cincinnati. His research team, in collaboration with U.S. Air Force scientists, has used DNA from salmon sperm to create a superior LED lighting device.“The double helix of its DNA has some interesting properties in regard to light emission,” Steckl said in a phone interview. “Because of the way it is shaped, you can insert light emitting molecules within it that operate more efficiently than in other host materials.”Salmon sperm is the first material ever used for bio-LEDs. Skeckl said it comes from a wild salmon fishery in Japan, where sperm is widely harvested for its DNA. It is refined into pure DNA fibers that Steckls’s team turn into thin films of tightly controlled dimensions that produce light.Steckl said the research is an example of a trend toward ‘greener’ electronics, including using waste products generated from U.S. farming and fishing industries. “The organic material is abundant and readily available – and it reduces the need for heavy metals and other hazardous materials,” he said.“This is not the sort of material that people have a lock on,” Steckl added. “In other words, it’s not a mine somewhere that produces a particular metal. People in the semi-conductor and flat panel display industries are quite concerned that certain specialty metals critical to device fabrication are going to begin to run out as soon as 10 years from now.Steckl said he believes the trend toward biomimetics, or mimicking nature, “is inevitable.” He said he would be interested in in collaborating with Alaska’s seafood industry for bio-materials.When asked if there is a difference between DNA of wild and farmed salmon sperm, Dr. Stekcl said: “There might be some difference in the yield.”Find Dr. Andrew Steckl at the nano-lab at the University of Cincinnati. a.steckl@uc.edu<COL>Salmon permits adjust upward<COL>2007-11-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/04/graying-of-the-fleet/<COL>Graying of the fleetThe “graying of the fleet” has been at the forefront in meetings around Alaska, where stakeholders strategize ways to secure future generations of Alaska fishermen.Getting less attention is the drifting away of fishery scientists and managers due to retirement — and Alaska is having a heck of a time filling those ranks.Nearly half of the state’s area biologists will retire soon, said John Hilsinger, director of the commercial fisheries division.“It’s even higher for our division leadership group, which is all the regional supervisors, chief fishery scientists and directors,” he said. “Eighty percent of those could retire now, or they will be eligible within five years.”The commercial fisheries division now has 300 permanent full time staff and 41 vacancies — or 14 percent.“Some of these jobs will be filled, but that’s a pretty high vacancy rate,” he said, adding that the toughest jobs to fill are the more technical positions — such as biometricians and analyst programmers.“We are still able to hire good people, but it’s definitely becoming more difficult,” Hilsinger said. “We have to recruit longer for fewer applicants. Sometimes we give up trying to fill a position after a year or two.”   “If we don’t have sufficient expertise, the natural tendency would be to be more conservative in management of the fisheries,” ADF&G Commissioner Denby Lloyd said at a town meeting in Kodiak.The workforce challenge is not unique to Fish and Game, points out Debbie Hart, coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Careers for Alaskans program.“It’s a national issue,” she said. “We have an aging workforce throughout America so all the state and federal agencies are experiencing workforce challenges, and a smaller pool of applicants coming up behind.”Alaska faces an added recruitment challenge from the huge salary gap between competing state and federal jobs. The state used to pay much more for fisheries biologists and managers, but over the past seven years the disparity has grown. The average paycheck for federal biologists is up to 35 percent higher, and 60 percent to 80 percent higher for regional supervisors, Hilsinger said.Fishery Recruits R’ UsThe University of Alaska is offering a new Bachelor of Arts in fisheries program this fall, the fourth in its line up of fisheries degrees.“We added it because we felt there are a lot of job opportunities in the industry that could be met with this new degree,” said Denis Wiesenburg, dean at the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (SFOS) at Fairbanks.The university was able to quickly get moving thanks to a $5 million grant from the Rasmuson Foundation, specific to creating a top-notch fisheries degree program for undergraduates.“They will be able to take more multi-disciplinary classes like seafood business, the Alaska fishing industry and do internships to get more experience while they are getting their education,” Wiesenburg said.The university’s ultimate goal is to “educate Alaskans in Alaska to study and manage Alaska’s fisheries,” Wiesenburg added.It already has a good track record: 37 percent of SFOS graduate students to work for Fish and Game or federal agencies in Alaska.“And they’re going to need lots of new trained employees,” Wiesenburg said. “The university wants to make sure we’re training Alaskans to fill those positions that will come up due to retirements over the next five years.”Wiesenburg said there has been “heartwarming” support from the fishing industry and the Alaska legislature for the new program. The BA in fisheries program is scheduled to begin this fall.

They’re down a bit now, but not by much, and still about 70-cents a pound higher across the board than at the same time last year.Halibut prices are traditionally broken out by three weight classes. At Kodiak, prices to fishermen were holding fairly steady at $3.80 a pound for fish weighing 10 to 20 pounds, $4.10 for 20-to-40 pounders and $4.35 for ‘40 ups.’At Homer, prices ranged from $4.25-$4.90 per pound and low landings resulted in “aggressive buying.”At Dutch Harbor, prices were being paid on a trip-by-trip basis but were said to be “much higher” than at the same time last year, meaning in the $3.50 and above range.In Southeast Alaska, halibut prices had bumped up a dime from the start of the season to $3.80 – $4.20 and $4.40 per pound.“Fresh halibut seems unstoppable in terms of demand, no matter what the price at either retail or food service,” said market analyst Ken Talley. “There is little if any downward trend in halibut prices at the wholesale level. Demand remains quite strong, especially for fresh fish, which is having an impact on frozen inventory.”Talley said the demand for frozen halibut has boosted wholesale prices since the March opening from $5.35 a pound (for 40-60s) to $5.65 and above.Lower landings is one factor that is keeping prices high, and deliveries could lag further as many fishermen shift to salmon. salmon. Complicating the supply picture, Talley said, is the import situation. The weakened dollar makes it less attractive to send imports, including halibut, to the U.S.“Importers have been losing out to buyers from Europe, where halibut is a popular item. U.S. buyers simply can’t pay enough for the imported product to make it as worthwhile for overseas suppliers as it has been. Norwegian buyers, for example, are often outbidding U.S. importers for frozen halibut from Russia. This inability to get all the halibut needed is another factor in higher prices,” he said.Eighteen million pounds (36 percent) of Alaska’s 52-million- pound halibut catch limit was taken by June 8. Kodiak was the leading port for landings, getting nearly 19 percent of all deliveries. That’s followed by Seward, Homer, Sitka and Petersburg.Halibut now ranks as Alaska’s third most valuable fishery, last year worth a record $193 million to longliners lucky enough to hold quota shares of the prized fish. The average Alaska halibut price last year was $3.71 per pound. The fishery ends in mid-November.Sitka says hello to Silver BayA major new seafood company plans to open in Sitka this summer. Silver Bay Seafoods is under construction at the site of the former Alaska Pulp Mill, east of downtown.“We are building a seafood processing plant from the ground up with the hopes of being done and ready in time for the June 17 fishery,” said assistant plant manager Brian Gannon, calling it “a massive super-structure.’Silver Bay plans to be a big player in the northern reaches of the Panhandle, according to Gannon. “Our goal is to buy and process 20-35 million pounds of salmon this year,” he said. “We are here to provide another outlet for the fishermen.”Silver Bay Seafoods is operated by Stikine Holdings and bankrolled primarily nearly $5 million in cash by about 30 fishermen “looking to try something different.” Last week the venture got a big boost from the state with a $1.2 million loan from the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority. The City and Borough of Sitka also provided a $900,000 loan, for a total project cost of $7.3 million.Silver Bay Seafoods expects to employ about 175 people at the height of salmon season. After some fine-tuning, the company plans to expand into other fisheries.“We would rather do one thing really well right now instead of doing 13 things marginally,” Gannon said. “We’d like to have a home run on salmon first.”Salmon saintAs salmon season enters full swing, it seems appropriate to acknowledge the patron saint of salmon — Saint Kentigern of Scotland.Born in 518, Kentigern (commonly called Mungo) was the illegitimate son of a king’s daughter. He trained as a priest at a monastery, where his saint-hood evolved around a dangerous love-triangle.Legend has it that the king suspected his wife of having an affair, because she had given one of her favorite rings to a court favorite. The king took the ring when the man was sleeping and threw it far out into the River Clyde. When he returned home, the king angrily demanded that his wife show him the missing ring and threatened her with death if she could not produce it.In her misery, the queen beseeched the priest Kentigern to help her. Kentigern took a fishing rod to the spot where the ring had been flung into the river. He quickly caught a salmon and cut it open. Amazingly, the ring was found in the salmon’s belly. The queen was able to deliver the ring to her doubting husband and peace was restored.From the time of his death in 603, Kentigern was regarded as Scotland’s patron saint and the cathedral at Glasgow was built in his honor. To this day Kentigern’s figure and symbols, including a salmon, make up Glasgow’s coat of arms.Who knows? Perhaps a quick prayer to the patron saint will lead more fish to your nets.<COL>Halibut demand still strong<COL>2007-06-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/08/salmon-feeds-young-minds/<COL>Salmon feeds young mindsGetting fish into the nation’s school lunch program is tough enough – making sure it is top quality and tasty is an even bigger challenge. A few Alaska schools and seafood companies are showing the rest of America how it’s done.Dillingham really got the ball rolling this summer when chief lunch lady Patty Luckhurst saw farmed tilapia and trout as federal commodity selections for school lunches. This in the land of the world’s largest red salmon run!Luckhurst spearheaded a program to put Bristol Bay sockeye salmon on the kids’ lunch trays. She approached local fishermen who were delighted to donate fish, and Peter Pan Seafoods offered to process it for free.“Within three days I had 4,000 pounds of beautiful red fillets all individually vacuum sealed in the school freezer. They’re beautiful,” Luckhurst said, adding that the salmon will be served in portions along with wild rice and broccoli, as well as salmon tacos, salad and patties.  “I might even have kids bring in their favorite salmon recipes from home,” she said.Luckhurst gives the federal government credit for trying to do a good job with its commodity food offerings, and it can be tough for schools to afford items that comply with strict nutritional guidelines.“But I don’t like all the processed stuff. I don’t like the kids to be thrilled to see pizza and corn dogs and chicken nuggets and hot dogs and canned chili. They need to eat real food,” she said.Many smaller schools, like Dillingham, still make spaghetti sauce from scratch, do their own baking, and serve halibut chowder, she said, adding: “Bigger schools don’t have the time or labor to do that.”Luckhurst, a 19 year veteran of school kitchens, agrees that high shipping costs to get fresh produce or proteins to remote regions can be prohibitive. That’s why it makes sense to purchase more foods locally.“Even if the fish wasn’t donated I believe the cost would be appropriate for us to buy it from here. And it behooves us to support our local fishermen all over the state. With all the reports about how healthy fish is and that we should all be eating more – with it right here there is no sense in bringing in processed stuff anymore,” Luckhurst said.Kodiak kids will be enjoying locally produced pink salmon in sandwiches and hot meals during the school year“We did trials last May and it went over really well. So the school district has given us a purchase order for the upcoming school year,” said Chris Sannito who produces the lightly smoked pink salmon product under his Wildsource label.Fish tacos made from Alaska pollock have also received high marks from school kids in three Lower 48 districts.“The biggest challenge is educating school food buyers that there is a big difference in fish quality,” said Pat Shanahan, project director for the Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers marketing group.GAPP is taking its message directly to school districts and national conferences.“What we’ve learned is that there is a lack of information about seafood and how to buy it,” Shanahan said. GAPP has created a curriculum for school district buyers that teaches them how to buy high quality products, and particularly products from Alaska,” Shanahan.“Our competing products are Alaska pollock that’s caught in Russian waters, frozen on the boat and shipped to China (primarily) where it’s thawed, cut up and frozen again into blocks. There are inherent quality differences in taste and texture,” Shanahan explained.Buying processed seafood products adds even more confusion. “If a product is changed substantially, like breaded, it becomes a ‘Product of the U.S.’ no matter where the raw material comes from,” she added.The pollock producers have created a program that allows school buyers to specify they want products bearing the GAPP logo.“That ensures the fish is harvested and processed in Alaska, and it is what the kids tasted in their fish tacos,” Shanahan said. “And schools can afford this product.”Shanahan said the response to getting more good seafood onto school lunch menus has been very positive and it is well worth the effort.“It’s an educational process so it’s sort of one school district at a time,” she said. “But it’s well worth it, because it is creating new seafood consumers for the future.”“Be creative in the school kitchen,” echoed Dillingham’s Patty Luckhurst. “Don’t be afraid to try new things. And ask the kids. They love fresh things. Sometimes what we’re feeding them in school might be the most nutritious meal they have all day.”Give and get a tax breakAnyone who pays Alaska taxes can get a big tax break by donating to the state university.“I think it’s one of the best-kept secrets in Alaska,” said Denis Wiesenburg, dean of the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks. “The Educational Tax Credit allows companies that pay taxes to the state of Alaska to give gifts to the university and in doing so, they can reduce their state taxes.”Wiesenburg pointed out that it’s not a tax deduction, but a credit — and it applies to many types of Alaska taxes.“Income tax, fisheries business or landing tax — they can get a tax credit by donating money to the university. That way they help support the university by reducing their tax burden at the same time,” he said.Another plus — donors can decide how the money will be spent.“Companies that donate can have that money go for a specific purpose — whether it’s a scholarship, funding for a specific research program, providing fellowships for graduate students or general unspecified support,” he said.The credit is 50 percent of the first $100,000 of contributions and 100 percent of the next $100,000 of contributions. Any person or company that pays taxes to the state can take advantage of the Educational Tax Credit. At a time of shrinking budgets, Wiesenburg calls it a win-win program for the university, Alaska businesses and communities.“It’s something we can do here in Alaska that most states aren’t able to do,” he said.<COL>Salmon feeds young minds<COL>2007-08-22<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/01/plans-for-aquaculture-grow/<COL>Plans for aquaculture growLaine WelchFish FactorLike it or not, policy makers are charging forward with plans to expand U.S. aquaculture output five fold by 2020. Last week the Marine Aquaculture Task Force unveiled recommendations to help guide development of the new industry, which will let offshore fish farmers lay claim to vast parcels of the sea.The farms will be colonies of undersea cages brimming with swimming livestock, anchored in U.S. waters from three to 200 miles from shore.Above all, the task force urges Congress to create laws ensuring strong environmental standards are in place to regulate offshore fish farms. At a press conference last week, panel member Alison Rieser said existing laws won’t work.“There is a complex jurisdictional framework over ocean space. To some extent the laws cover the major issues of aquaculture expansion, but they are not well coordinated, there is overlap, and a number of serious gaps,” said Reiser, a professor at the Univ. of Hawaii and coauthor of the leading casebook on ocean and coastal law.“There is no one lead federal agency that has the power to issue authorization for a private company to occupy a portion of the ocean space for commercial aquaculture and oversee  potential  impacts,” she added.The panel recommends that all authorities should go to NOAA Fisheries, and not to regional management councils. “It doesn’t seem prudent to have them consider how to balance aquaculture and wild capture fisheries,” Reiser said.Offshore fish farms should be limited to native species, said Becky Goldberg, senior scientist for Environmental Defense. The government should also promote reduction fisheries, or feeder fish, for the aquaculture industry, and develop alternatives to wild ingredient feeds.“The upshot is that you have to catch wild fish to feed farmed fish,” Goldberg said.Along with satisfying America’s growing appetite for seafood, expanding U.S. aquaculture will reduce the nation’s dependence on imports. More than 75 percent of all seafood eaten in the U.S. comes from other countries.Nearly half of all seafood consumed in the world comes from fish farms, primarily shrimp and salmon. The industry is expanding globally by 10 percent a year compared to two percent in the U.S.Good regulations and technology advances can address any concerns about aquaculture, and it should be expanded into a profitable U.S. industry, urged task force member Daniel Benetti, Director of Aquaculture at the Univ. of Miami.“It’s going to get done abroad, regardless, and then we’re going to import the fish. It’s the same production model, even in the clothes we wear – it’s all got a U.S. brand but is produced abroad.”   Find the full report at www.whoi.edu/sites/marineaquataskforce .Kodiak Solstix – Grab ‘em and go jerky sticks made from Kodiak pink salmon made a national splash on the Outdoor Channel’s ‘North to Alaska’ program on the Outdoor Channel. The debut of Kodiak Solstix as a program sponsor and in the form of a 30 second ad resulted in a “staggering” response by viewers, according to Denver-based distributor Bill Gillette.“I could have set my watch based on the flurry of activity that hit our e-commerce site the minute the TV show aired. It was non stop. Multiple hits and sales per minute,” Gillette said, who declined to give the final total. The ad will air for 48 weeks.Kodiak Solstix, sold under the Alaska Spirit label, were created two years ago by state fisheries biologists Mark Witteveen and Rob Baer. The jerky sticks, which come in spicy pepper and teriyaki flavors, are in snack vending machines in local schools and have gotten the ok by the Anchorage school district. Witteveen said Kodiak Solstix will also use MySpace, YouTube and X-Games athletes to reach out to the youth market. “We are targeting the young, healthy active audience combined with the convenience food market, Witteveen said.Distributor Bill Gillette called the product a “home run” in the explosive $3 billion meat snacks market.  “It’s got heart healthy omega 3’s, it’s wild salmon from a sustainable fishery, high in protein, low fat, super convenient, no need for refrigeration, and it’s affordable,” he said. Packages of three Solstix sell for about $2.00.“I believe this will crank up to a level where Alaska Spirit’s Solstix could become a major company based up there in Kodiak, Alaska,” Gillette said.Find Kodiak Solstix at www.wildsalmonjerky.com .Fish ‘n flush – The bathroom could become your home’s most popular attraction simply by adding a Fish ‘n Flush –a toilet tank and working aquarium all in one.The new product, from California-based AquaOne Technologies, replaces a standard toilet tank fronted by a fully functioning, two and a half gallon aquarium.“It’s a lot of fun and brings a little whimsy into your bathroom. No one has decorated a toilet before, so we’re the first to do so,” said AquaOne’s Dave Parrish.The novelty “nushnik” has been featured on several major TV networks and been a huge hit at trade shows   “It stops them dead in their tracks,” he said in a phone interview.Kids love the product and moms say it helps with potty training. “No fish are harmed in flushing,” Parrish is quick to add.Some customers are using the Fish ‘n Flush for frogs and lizards, or as a terrarium.   “One guy in Georgia is raising bass in his. Another is housing a crawfish that has molted three times,” Parrish said.The average do-it yourselfer can install the two piece toilet tank in a matter of minutes. Fish n Flush comes fully equipped and sells for $299.  www.fishnflush.com<COL>Plans for aquaculture grow<COL>2007-01-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/11/salmon-markets-diversify/<COL>Salmon markets diversifyBy Laine WelchIt used to be that the Alaska salmon industry was criticized for “putting all its eggs into one basket,” meaning, selling all of its big-money fish – sockeye – to one customer, Japan.That’s not the case any longer. For the past decade, the trend has been a steady shift away from that traditional customer toward eager markets in the U.S. and Europe. The latest Seafood Market Report from the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute reports frozen sockeye salmon exports to Japan so far this year are 27 million pounds, just 33 percent of the total pack. This contrasts sharply with the past two years when production levels were similar, but Japan imported 66 to 69 percent of Alaska frozen sockeye.  Frozen sockeye is by far the most valuable salmon product produced in Alaska, with first wholesale value of nearly $160 million in 2005.The sockeye market is of keen interest for the industry, especially since Alaska harvests have topped 40 million reds for three years running. The export and sales patterns since 2004 are the most relevant for illustrating the changing market destinations for Alaska’s frozen sockeye, the report said.Conversely, the market for canned sockeye is facing a glut.  While the sales season for all canned salmon begins in September, all indications point to a large carryover of canned reds from previous years, plus above-average volumes coming into the market from British Columbia Canada.There is a rosier outlook for pink salmon, as fewer of those fish end up in cans. Canned production this year, combined with carryover inventory, adds up to the lowest caseload in several years, the Seafood Market Report said. “In fact, closer to 55 percent of the pink harvest is now going into cans. That compares to roughly 76 percent in recent years. We’re seeing a big shift into higher-value frozen pink production,” said Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Group, producer of the market report for ASMI.Salmon fillets continue to be the biggest trendsetter, and Alaska processors are “putting in more fillet lines all over the state, especially for sockeye,” McDowell said. First wholesale prices for fresh fillets showed the largest price increase this year with gains between 27 and 36 percent. The total value of fresh and frozen Alaska salmon fillets from May through August jumped from $18 million to $26 million dollars, an increase of 41 percent.Through mid-September, state managers report the total 2006 Alaska salmon harvest at 135 million fish, ranking as the 17th-largest catch on record.

Whereas the animals are thriving throughout Southeast Alaska, populations from Kodiak and further west have dropped dramatically since the 1980s, and they are listed on the federal endangered species list.Every two years, federal researchers from the Seattle-based Alaska Fisheries Science Center conduct aerial surveys to assess trends in the numbers of adult and juvenile sea lions at nearly 250 sites, ranging from Cape St. Elias to Attu Island. The mix of sites has been surveyed consistently since the mid 1970s or the 1990s. Population counts from 2000 through 2004 showed nearly a 12 percent increase in sea lions throughout the westward region, the first increase since the late 1970s.For two weeks in June this year, researchers were able to only survey 159 of the sites due partly to bad weather that grounded survey flights. Researchers were also hamstrung by court-ordered delays stemming from a lawsuit by the U.S. Humane Society that found federal managers had failed to comply with regulations in issuing research permits.A summary memorandum said the June 2006 survey yielded no new information on abundance trends for the entire western stock of sea lions. The counts of non pups in the eastern and western Gulf of Alaska and eastern Aleutians appear to be unchanged since 2004, suggesting that adult and juvenile populations may have stabilized. The survey indicated, however, that sea lion declines appear to be continuing in the western Aleutians, perhaps as much as 19 percent.

Scientists from around the world will gather this week to discuss the ability of members of a family of fishes called gadids to adapt to human and environmental pressures. Gadids include 30 species of cod, haddock, pollock, lings, whiting, and hake that inhabit the cold waters of the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Arctic Oceans.The conference, Resiliency of Gadid Stocks to Fishing and Climate Change, will include experts from the United States, Canada, Norway, Russia, and other fishing nations, to discuss what’s needed for gadids to cope with fishing and climate changes. The meeting is the 24th Lowell Wakefield Fisheries Symposium, coordinated by Alaska Sea Grant since 1982 to bring scientists together to discuss research and help improve fisheries management and marine conservation. The series is named after Lowell Wakefield, founder of the Alaska king crab industry.The conference takes place at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage October 31-November 3.

The project, which includes surveys and extensive site visits, reveals some interesting attitudes and trends.“It’s really the only thing out there to help track what’s going on with the fleet and the industry,” said Randy Rice, Seafood Technical Program director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, which conducts the program. The actual work is done by Anchorage-based Dittman Research and Graystar Pacific Seafood, and this year was funded by the state Commerce Department.The tracking reveals that from 1991 through 1996, salmon-handling practices improved, followed by some backsliding through 2001 by both fishermen and processors, said Graystar’s Steve Grabacki.“There was less willingness to deliver fish in a timely fashion, chill fish, and upgrade boats to improve quality. For processors, it was a matter of how long they handled the fish or let it sit before processing or freezing,” he explained.Grabacki said the big drop in salmon prices seemed to spawn an attitude that “quality doesn’t pay, so why bother.” But that negative outlook has turned around more recently.“From 2001 to 2006, there has been a recognition that fish prices are not going to magically bounce back, that there is a whole different competitive market, and we need to change our behavior in order to get better prices. There is a willingness to do something different and it’s reflected statewide,” Grabacki said.He added that one of the most notable trends during the past 15 years is in the number of fishermen who are selling their own catches.“It was very noticeable from 1996 to 2001 and there has been a huge increase in direct marketing and self-processing fishermen through 2006. Far more fishermen are taking their fate into their own hands and getting permits to do so,” Grabacki said.A glance at the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game’s “Processors and Buyers: Intent to Operate” data for 2006 shows 478 names listed under the Catcher/Seller category, and 225 in the Direct Marketer category, from a total of 1,203 entries. For 2005, the listings were 588 under catcher/seller and 190 under direct marketer, from 1,400 entries.The data can change daily and do not reflect fishermen in several other related categories, a spokesman for the state Commercial Fisheries division advised.There have been similar “spikes and subsidings” in fishermen’s self-marketing interest over the past 20 years, according to Fish and Game deputy director, Geron Bruce.“We’ll have to watch it over a longer time frame to see if it is really a trend or a cycle we’ve seen before,” he added.“It’s certainly working for some fishermen, but it is very difficult and definitely not for everyone,” said ASMI’s Randy Rice. “The ones who are successful over the long term are those who establish close relationships with their customers.” ASMI uses the findings from the ongoing salmon-handling project to tailor its training programs and materials.

Intrafish reports that researchers at the University of Maryland School of Engineering have developed tiny, chitin-covered sensors that can detect miniscule quantities of explosives, biochemicals and other dangerous substances in air and water. It could lead to security and safety innovations at airports, hospitals and other public locations. The researchers purchase chitin in a purified, flake-form from scientific supply companiesThe system uses multiple, chitin-coated vibrating brackets (similar to tiny diving boards), plus optical sensing technology that can see when there is a change in the vibrations.Different brackets can detect different substances and concentrations. When a dangerous substance enters the device, the chitin on a specific bracket detects it and causes the vibrations to change.Researchers believe the new microsystem has many applications for homeland security, and they have applied for six technology patents.  They have also submitted a proposal to the National Institute of Health to develop a sensor system to detect the presence of bird flu. After cellulose, chitin is nature’s most abundant biological compound. It is now being used in bandages to stop severe bleeding, and in nasal sprays to treat asthma and other allergies.<COL>Researchers issue ‘reality check’<COL>2006-08-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/06/foodmiles-new-buzz-word/<COL>‘Foodmiles’ new buzz wordBy Laine WelchAs people around the world ponder ways to protect our planet from theimpacts of global warming, “food miles” are being used as a measure ofhow far food travels before it reaches the consumer. The logic is thefewer miles foods are transported, the less fuel is used, therebyreducing the “carbon footprint” on the environment.Theconcept of food miles is being embraced by “Big Business.” At agathering last week at the Monterey Aquarium, Whole Foods, Bon Appetitand Wal-Mart announced they are doing more to reduce the distances theyuse in transporting the foods they purchase.“I think food milesis going to be the next big issue of sustainability,” Peter Redmond,Wal-Mart’s vice president in charge of seafood said in press reports.Redmondcalled supporting sustainability issues “good for business” and part ofWal-Mart’s “business plan.”  Last year the world’s largest retailer ledthe charge to source its seafoods only from fisheries certified assustainable and well-managed by the international Marine StewardshipCouncil.Alaska’s largest fisheries – salmon, pollock and halibut –have the MSC stamp of approval. That gives Alaska a big advantage interms of ‘earth friendly’ seafood purchases. But how will Alaska’sdistance from markets be affected by food miles?“My first responseis you’ve got to get the fish from where the fish are. They are goingto have to source Alaska seafood from Alaska, regardless of whetherit’s close or far,” said Ray Riutta, director of the Alaska SeafoodMarketing Institute.Riutta said sourcing products closer to home isa great concept — if you have them. While it’s good to be idealistic,it’s also important to be realistic.“Half the seafood produced inthe U.S. comes from Alaska, so the reality is that a lot of the seafoodgoing into these stores will come from Alaska, regardlessof thedistance. If they want wild seafood they’re going to have to get itfrom Alaska,” he said.Riutta added that reducing “food miles” and“carbon footprints” is part of a larger trend toward protecting theenvironment, and ultimately, he believes that will reflect well onAlaska.“We have a heck of a good story to tell. Clearly, we’ve gotthe best sustainability story in the world, so anyone who is interestedin supporting well-managed fisheries is going to source their seafoodfrom Alaska first,” he said.Riutta added that it will be achallenge to make sure the buying public is aware of what Alaska has tooffer “in terms of our seafood coming from a state that takes greatpride in protecting its natural environment.”Wild salmon fuelsathletes — Several of the nation’s top athletes are making wild salmonjerky sticks from Kodiak a big part of their everyday diet.Thesnack sticks might have given the edge to world and Olympic speedskating champ Apolo Anton Ohno, who last week took home the trophy inTV’s hugely popular (and grueling)  “Dancing With the Stars”competition while in training for the 2010 Olympics.Kodiak Solstixare made from locally caught pink salmon and packaged in spicy pepperand teriyaki flavors. The shelf-stable, grab-and-go snacks are marketedunder the Alaska Spirit label, and were created with athletes in mind,said co-creator Mark Witteveen.  He and partner Rob Baer pitched theSolstix to former world power lifting champion John Schaeffer, now anutritionist and professional athlete trainer“He works with Apoloand U.S. short track skating champion Allison Baver and Giddeon Massie,a U.S. sprint cycling champ, and several other athletes. He startedputting Kodiak Solstix into their nutrition regimen and some of themeat five or six packages a day – they are really liking the results,”Witteveen said.The protein-packed snack sticks are also a big hitwith super middle-weight boxer Wayne Johnsen, who will fight in an HBOtelevised event on Saturday at New York’s Madison Square Garden.“Hisentire ringside crew and a lot of our athletes will be in the audiencewearing ‘Team Johnsen – Fueled by Kodiak Solstix’ T-shirts,” Witteveensaid.Meanwhile, the Kodiak entrepreneurs (both also are statefishery biologists) are moving their operation into a new and largerproduction facility. They are expanding distribution throughout theLower 48, and are intent upon getting Solstix into school vendingmachines.  Witteveen said they will soon increase their product linewith halibut and pollock snack items.Tongues andcheeks – Resurgence in popularity of cod tongues topped the fish presslast week, and prompted another look at how millions of tons of fishdiscards can be turned into items that are useful or delicious.Newfoundland’sGlobe and Mail reported, for example, that long ago, cod tongues wouldprovide pocket money for kids at a rate of 15 cents per dozen. Todaythe tongues are selling for $8.50 a pound, fresh or frozen, at localgrocers.  Hotels and restaurants are serving crispy fried cod tonguesfor $13 per plate or more and they are said to be a top-seller.Alaska’s catch quota this year of more than half a billion pounds could add up to a lot of tasty cod tongues.Likewise, halibut cheeks can also mean “ka-ching” at seafood sellers’ cash registers.“I don’t know any company that doesn’t cut out the cheeks,” said one Kodiak major processor.“We always send out our halibut with the heads on,” said another big buyer at Petersburg.“Iam a huge fan of halibut cheeks. I think that is one of the greatestcuts of fish of all times,” said seafood Roger Berkowitz, head of theeast coast Legal Seafoods chain of restaurants and fish markets.Halibutcheeks were retailing for $15.99 a pound at Seattle’s Pikes PlaceMarket. Several Alaska-based seafood Web sites were selling cheeks from$17.95 to nearly $22 a pound. Amazon.com was featuring halibut cheeksat four packs of three cheeks for $52.50.Federal figuresestimate that U.S. fisheries, on average, throw away 22 percent, ormore than 1 million tons, of all the fish harvested. Alaska has thelowest discard levels, and state seafood companies and researchers aremaking advances in finding more uses for fish by-products, includingpowders, omega-3 laden oils, and other marine based nutriceuticals andpharmaceuticals.To denote the value inherent in fish wastes, theyhave been dubbed “co-products” by Peter Bechtel, a leading scientist atthe University of Alaska/Fairbanks. The Alaska Fisheries DevelopmentFoundation is planning a major conference that will convene global“co-products” leaders in Alaska early next year.<COL>‘Foodmiles’ new buzz word<COL>2007-06-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/04/crab-farms-experiment-with-growth/<COL>Crab farms experiment with growthby Laine WelchPeople are already growing crops of king crab in several countries around the world.   But tracking how well the home-grown crabs might survive in the wild remains one of the biggest mysteries. That was just one of the fascinating findings shared by the world’s foremost crab scientists future at a first of its kind gathering two weeks ago in Kodiak.In Japan, for example, researchers 10 years ago produced half a million king crab larvae in large hatchery vats. The small crabs were eventually placed in bags in the ocean to harden and after several months, they were released into the ocean. But no follow up was done, so nothing is known about their survival.Russian researcher Nina Kovacheva of Moscow has developed a closed recirculation system for king crab that has yielded a 35 percent survival rate through the first stage of development.  Her team is now raising 2,000 juvenile crabs in a 1,500 square meter pen on the sea floor (about half the size of a football field). The Russian scientists are also using a system of 42 floating tanks, each holding about 40 pounds of king crab.Gustavo Lovrich of Argentina, who focuses on golden king crab, has discovered that good aeration and water quality are keys to their survival. Likewise, Kurt Paschke of Chile has learned that tiny golden king crabs grow best when they are raised in the dark, because they spend less energy swimming. Paschke raises his crabs in salmon egg trays using upwelling water, with densities of up to 800 crabs per tray. He has found that with good water exchange, fast growers may reach 100 millimeters in 3.5 years. Paschke hopes to soon produce over 19,000 golden crabs per year.Closer to home, Tom Shirley at the University of Alaska Fairbanks School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (Juneau campus) has discovered that golden king crabs produce eggs that are 20 times the size of red king crab, and that the newly hatched eggs contain large quantities of lipid (fats). Consequently, they don’t need to feed and can live more than six months without doing so. Also in Alaska, Brad Stevens has raised several hundred red and blue king crab in PVC tubes and beakers over four years at the federal Near Island Research Facility at Kodiak. He said one of his biggest challenges is refining their diet of brine shrimp and diatoms.Stevens credited researcher Gro van der Meeren of Norway with giving the group a “reality check.” She pointed out that few crab enhancement programs have been successful due to a lack of ecological understanding. The goal is simple: to release small crabs, and allow them to grow to maturity and recapture them. She told the group that the animals must first be adapted to their new conditions in the wild. They need to be released under correct light and temperature conditions, they need to find shelter immediately, and the habitat must be appropriate. Stevens added:  “We need to give hatchery raised crabs the chance to acquire adaptive behaviors by challenging them in the lab with natural habitats, foods and predators. And in order to determine the effectiveness of such a program, we need a method to mark hatchery raised crabs in order to distinguish them from wild crabs.”Stevens said it is certainly possible to enhance king crab stocks in Alaska, but it would require a large financial outlay.“I’m guessing $20 million for a facility and operating costs of $2 – $3 million a year. Those are government estimates,” he said, adding that the cost would likely be far less if a project was undertaken by fishermen.Stevens said, “If you started with 200 females, you could expect to produce 30 million larvae. Survival to the first crab stage might range from 25 to 75 percent, and survival to maturity or capture size about eight years later might range from 3 to 25 percent if you’re lucky. At current prices, that should produce a benefit to cost ratio of from one to 10. If you’re a banker and your goal is to make money, you say this is not the best investment. But if your goals are to maintain fishing opportunities, to re-establish depleted populations, to provide employment for fishermen and their offspring, to maintain the socioeconomic structures of coastal communities, and to produce a high quality seafood product, then maybe it would be a good thing.”WILD SALMON CAR WINS! The Wild Alaska Salmon race car won the March 28 race at the Miami Grand Prix. Sponsored by 10th & M Seafoods of Anchorage and Emory Motorsports of Oregon, the big win followed a third place finish in the Rolex series a few weeks before. Tenth and M owner Skip Winfree said he has received more than 4,000 calls and e-mails seeking more information about the racing Porsche. He credits the Wild Salmon logo with a 20 percent increase in online orders for his seafood market since it began appearing on the race circuit last year. 	Winfree is hopeful that the Alaska salmon industry will put up some money for the sponsorship, or it might be bumped in favor of other paying sponsors who are clamoring to get their names on the winning car.SALMON SWEEPSTAKES – In another tribute to wild salmon, Alaska Airlines will celebrate the “official” start of the season next month with a Copper River sweepstakes. The promotion is aimed at touting the famous fish as “one of the nation’s most prized healthy foods,” as well as the role the airline plays in delivering Alaska seafood to customers.Twenty sweepstakes winners will each receive 20 pounds of Copper River salmon fillets from Prime Select Seafoods of Cordova.  The grand prize winner will receive a fishing adventure for four hosted by Cordova’s Alaskan Wilderness Outfitting Company.  Last year Alaska Airlines transported more than 30 million pounds of Alaska seafood   to markets in the United States, Canada and Mexico.OH MY, THOSE OMEGAS! Seventy-eight percent of Americans recognize that omega-3 fatty acids found in some fish (and some fortified foods) may reduce the risk of heart disease. That’s according to a survey of 1,060 people aged 18 or older conducted by the International Food Information Council.Meanwhile, another study in Britain has added to earlier claims that omega-3s in fish oils can help with children’s behavioral problems. Seafood.com reports that a group of 25 youngsters aged 12 to 15 with severe attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were given fish oil supplements for three months.  Before the trial began, 94 percent of the subjects had high ratings for inattention and impulsivity. After taking the fish oil supplements, the severe impulsivity was cut to 28 percent and severe inattention fell to 17 percent. The lead researcher, Madeleine Portwood, called the results “stunning.” Portwood conducted a similar study on younger children aged 18 months to 30 months and found omega 3 supplements improved their behavior.<COL>Crab farms experiment with growth<COL>2006-04-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/01/rationalization-ends-the-race/<COL>Rationalization ends the raceBy Laine WelchThe Bering Sea crab fishery, now newly operating under a quota share plan, has been in place for just a few months, starting in August with golden king crab along the Aleutian chain, followed in mid-October by the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay. As intended, the “rationalization” program (referred to as crab ratz) has ended the race for fish. At the same time, it has changed the traditional pace, pricing and patterns of the crab fisheries, and drastically reduced the number of players.Kodiak, King Cove and Sand Point have partnered to provide an early glimpse at how crab ratz is trickling down into their towns.  They’ve hired a fisheries economist to track three key things: how many people are working in the crab fisheries, how the compensation of crews and skippers has changed under the new system, and how spending by the fishing fleet may have changed.“It takes decades to really understand the effects of a major fisheries change, but it does have a profound effect on just about everyone involved or associated with that fishery. It affects whole communities,” said Gunnar Knapp, an economist at the University of Alaska/Anchorage Institute of Social and Economic Research, who will lead the study.Knapp said he believes there is general agreement that we “have gone into a lot of changes in the past without a whole lot of thinking in advance about what the implications might be, and without necessarily studying what the effects have been.”At a time when Gulf of Alaska groundfish is already in the “restructuring” pipeline, Knapp said “it just makes sense to know as much as you can about what the effects are likely to be.”  He added that radical fishery changes result in a mix of good and bad, with differing opinions on what that mix is. “It’s useful to try and establish what actually happens … not just speculation. And it’s good to begin documenting it right away,” Knapp said.Kodiak city manager Linda Freed agreed. “This data documents some of the anecdotal evidence of negative impacts the North Pacific Council has been hearing from community members. It will help the city and borough make the case to council members to pay close attention to the needs of coastal communities,” Freed told the Kodiak Daily Mirror.Knapp will unveil the study’s early findings during ComFish in mid-March. The formal ISER crab ratz economic impact report will be completed by March 27. Anyone with knowledge to share should contact Gunnar Knapp at gunnar.knapp@uaa.alaska.edu or 786-7717.Bay delayThe date for Bristol Bay salmon fishermen to vote for their own marketing group has been pushed back from March 1 to May 1. Called Regional Seafood Development Associations, the groups make up an innovative new state program designed to boost seafood sales in 12 distinct Alaska regions. The RSDA gives fishermen the chance to direct their own marketing ventures using their own money. But first, they must vote to approve a tax to fund the RSDA based on their salmon landings.Organizers decided to delay the vote because Bay permit holders need to better understand the RSDA concept, said interim board member, Bob Waldrop.“It was clear at a meeting at Fish Expo in November that we had not done a very good job about getting the word out, or in such way that people really understood it,” he said. Waldrop said the tone of the meeting started out “very skeptical” but ended with a strong show of support for an RSDA.A 1 percent landing tax on Bristol Bay sockeye by drift gillnet and setnet permit holders (roughly 2,900) could yield more than $1 million dollars each season, at a cost of about $300 per fisherman. The money can also be used for infrastructure development, new products, and various programs in partnership with state or local groups.Copper River/Prince William Sound salmon fishermen were the first to embrace the RSDA concept. Southeast’s Rainforest Wild will vote soon to include a whopping 69 different fisheries in its RSDA.“The possibilities are very exciting,” Waldrop said. “So we’re going to take a little extra time and redouble our efforts to get more information out to Bristol Bay fishermen.”Name namesFisheries stakeholders will be soon be lobbying hard to get their chosen reps on Alaska’s elite policy making boards: the state Board of Fisheries and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.The BOF has two and possibly three seats up for grabs. The terms of Fred Bouse of Fairbanks and Jeremiah Campbell of Seward end this year. Board chairman Art Nelson is also expected to step down to dedicate more time to his new job as consultant to a Western Alaska fisheries group. The seven member board of fish is charged with regulating commercial, sport, subsistence and personal use fisheries in state waters, meaning out to three miles. Members are appointed by the governor and must be confirmed by the Alaska legislature.Two seats will also be vacated on the NPFMC, which advises on federal fisheries from three to two hundred miles offshore. The terms of Arne Fuglvog of Petersburg and Ed Rasmuson of Anchorage end this year. Names for those seats also are selected by the governor and approved by the Secretary of Commerce in Washington, D.C.Do fish farms spread bird flu?Bird flu may be spread by using chicken poop as food in fish farms. That’s according to Bird Life International, the world’s leading bird conservation organization in one hundred countries.Fertilizing fish ponds with poop is a common practice in developing countries. Called “integrated livestock fish farming,” it involves transferring wastes from pigs, ducks or chickens directly to fish farms. IntraFish reported that at the right dosage, the nutrients in the manure give an enormous boost to the growth of plankton in the fish ponds, which are the main food of fish such as carp, and (increasingly popular) tilapia.Bird Life believes the practice may set up major reservoirs of bird flu infection, if the poultry providing the poop are infected themselves. The suggestion echoes the mad cow scare when cattle were infected by their food. The practice also puts a big question mark over a procedure that is firmly backed by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization.Bird Life is calling for an investigation into the possibility that thousands of manure fed ponds across Asia may be the means by which the potentially deadly strain of bird flu is being spread. IntraFish said although no mention has been made of the possible links between poopie ponds and influenza, the issue has been raised before. An FAO report two years ago references a paper published in the journal Nature in 1988 titled “Fish farming and influenza pandemics.” It said bringing together fish farms and livestock may well be the creation of a considerable human health hazard.<COL>Rationalization ends the race<COL>2006-01-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/01/fish-factor-decision-making-for-skippers/<COL>Fish Factor: Decision-making for skippersBy Laine WelchHow do fishermen make risky decisions out on the water? Researchers are hoping Alaska halibut skippers will help them find out.Quinn Weninger, an economist at Iowa State University, is leading a study called Decision-Making in Uncertain Circumstances: Learning from Alaskan Halibut Fishermen. He has put out a call for 50 to 60 halibut skippers to participate in the project for the 2006 and 2007 fisheries.“Halibut fishing is a great example of a process in which decisions have to be made about where fish might be, and the decisions are all subject to various forms of uncertainty. It is a very interesting, natural experiment for us to try and test some of the theories that are being put forth about decision making under uncertainty. That’s the motivation for this study,” Weninger said.Researchers suggest that people tend to use simplifications or “rules of thumb” — called heuristics — to aid in the complex task of making decisions under uncertainty. “These rules of thumb can lead to errors or mistakes, and there is tremendous interest in the academic community to try and uncover how these various heuristics influence decisions,” Weninger said.For the two-year halibut project, each skipper will be given a hand held computer and GPS logger, and asked to “point and click” through a short list of questions before they leave for a fishing trip.“They’ll be asked about the thought processes that went into making the decision about where they are going to fish, and in particular, what they expect to catch,” Weninger said. “At the end of the trip, they’ll do another round of questions, such as what might have changed out on the water, and how they reacted as the trip proceeded.”He stressed that all fishing data will remain strictly confidential.Weninger added that getting “real” results from the fishing grounds will be more meaningful than from controlled experiments. “Because we will be gathering data from real decision makers where risks are important and the stakes really matter, we think we’ll have something to say that is new and exciting,” Weninger said.Results of the two-year study, which is funded by the National Science Foundation, will help researchers learn how expectations are formed, how choices are made, and how the level of risk affects the decision-making process.

It promotes Alaska pollock in markets around the world with a focus on Europe, North America and Asia. GAPP members are now in Orlando , Florida for a three day School and Child Nutrition Industry Conference, which brings together food decision makers and seafood suppliers. The GAPP’s goal is to convince them to use more pollock products in the nation’s school lunch program.According to Intrafish, GAPP will share results of a pilot project done last fall in three school districts in Seattle, Houston and Virginia Beach. It showed that students were very receptive to Alaska fish tacos, and they would like them to be part of their regular school lunch menus. GAPP president Rick Muir said the group is developing more child-tested menu items, and they believe children would enjoy fish more if better quality products were available in American schools.Pollock pay outSpeaking of Alaskan pollock, many will be surprised to learn that pollock is the source of the largest, privately funded marine research program for state universities in Alaska’s history. Since 2000, member boats of the At-Sea Processors Association have donated a total of $1 million each year to the Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center, headquartered at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks.“The PCCRC is one of our real delights,” said Denis Weisenberg, dean of UAF’s School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. “Part of their contribution goes to an endowed chair, part to a research endowment, and part of it funds directed research.”Studies have focused on predation of northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands, jellyfish impacts on food-web production, the use of acoustic data loggers on fishing vessels, and the possible relationship between killer whales and disappearing sea lions.Symphony of seafoodThe popular Alaska Symphony of Seafood kicks off Thursday at the Hyatt Regency Lake Las Vegas Resort. Now in its 13th year, the 2006 event has attracted 19 new Alaska seafood products from large and small companies. The entries compete in three categories — retail, foodservice and smoked — and are judged by a panel that represents diverse segments related to the seafood industry.Of note this year is a new fish entry into the field long dominated by salmon. Prowler Fisheries of Petersburg and Seattle restaurateur Tom Douglas have partnered to offer five specially flavored sablefish tenderloin dishes.Except for the Las Vegas People’s Choice Award, all winners will be kept secret and announced at a second Symphony event Feb. 4 at the Fourth Avenue Theater in Anchorage. All top winners receive a trip to the International Boston Seafood Show in March.<COL>Fish Factor: Decision-making for skippers<COL>2006-01-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/01/2005-a-big-year-for-fish-industry/<COL>2005 a big year for fish industryby Laine WelchGoing into the New Year, commercial fishing in Alaska remains a vibrant industry that is the envy of every other fish-producing country in the world.  Alaska’s fisheries’ abundance is guarded with protective zeal by those entrusted with its care, and its management is regarded as a model for conservation and sustainability.  The robust stocks will continue to provide a solid foundation far into the future, even as Alaska’s fisheries are being retooled to conform to the tough realities of changing times.Here is a sampler of industry highlights from 2005, in no particular order:• Fleet reduction is a major trend across the North Pacific and rationalization, restructuring and revitalization remained the buzz words of 2005.  Managers and policy makers continued to seek ways to winnow down the number of participants, both to protect the fishery resources and boost bottom lines.• Alaska’s salmon industry continued its slow rise from the ashes, brought about by its own good merit, millions of state and federal dollars, and unprecedented bad press about farmed fish. The 2005 salmon harvest was the third largest on record, topping 206 million fish. The value of the catch was also up for the third year in a row, worth $295 million at the docks (up $23 million from 2004).• A national poll revealed that 31 percent of Americans are concerned about mercury in seafood and are cutting back on the amount they eat. The poll added there is tremendous confusion about what seafoods contain mercury. A Harvard study countered that if fish consumption is reduced, there will be serious public health consequences, notably higher death rates from heart disease and stroke• The nation’s new Food Pyramid watered down its original dietary guidelines that advised Americans to eat fish at least twice a week, instead treating it as an afterthought and listing it under the “meat and beans” section.• Studies from around the world continued to tout the medical miracles stemming from the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, especially salmon. Sales of fish oil supplements in the United States climbed from $35 million 10 years ago, to $310 million in 2005.• Americans ate a record 16.6 pounds of seafood per person — five ounces per week, or less than half of what is recommended by health professionals. In a national survey conducted by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, 81 percent of the respondents said they want more seafood choices at their favorite fast food restaurants.• The annual Symphony of Seafood’s grand prize went to Orca Bay’s Sockeye Salmon Fillets. The out-of-state venue shifted from Chicago to Las Vegas in 2006.• Alaska salmon became a part of NASCAR Nation. A Wild Alaska Salmon logo is emblazoned across a racing Porsche co-sponsored by 10th & M Seafoods of Anchorage.• The nation’s top fishery managers called it “a great day” as the National Offshore Aquaculture Act was introduced to Congress in June.• Country of origin labeling laws  went into effect for fish and shellfish at U.S. retail counters.  The labels tell consumers where their seafood comes from and whether it is wild or farmed. Alaskans were outraged that canned or pouched products were not included.• Southeast salmon gillnetters got the jump on Copper River when, for the first time in almost 20 years, on May 2, the Stikine and Taku Rivers reopened for king salmon.• For the second time in decades, much of the Yukon’s summer king salmon  was enjoyed in upscale U.S. eateries via the region’s Kwik’Pak Fisheries. A small order of fresh Yukon kings fetched $273 per fish at the Tsukiji Market in Tokyo.• The World Wildlife Fund launched an international Smart Gear contest which paid cash prizes for the best ideas to reduce bycatch in fisheries. There were no entries from Alaska.• Thirty-seven farm sites were approved for black cod on British Columbia’s Vancouver Island. However, a report by the University of B.C. concluded that industrialized black cod farming is unlikely to deliver economic benefits to the province.• Efforts by Alaska policy makers to create a limited entry plan for Gulf of Alaska groundfish (Senate Bill 113) went down in flames.• A sting operation in New York revealed a huge mislabeling scam in which farmed salmon was being sold as fresh wild salmon. That prompted salmon producers in Cordova and the Aleutians East Borough to send their fish to market with tags telling customers it was the real deal.• While most fishing regions of the state were promoting their own “brand” of red and king salmon, the Star of Kodiak group sang the praises of pinks in upscale restaurants in Washington, D.C.  Millions of cans of pink salmon from Bear and Wolf Processors in Cordova went for the first time to large chain stores throughout Korea.• McKie Campbell took the helm as Commissioner of the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game.• The North Pacific Fishery Management Council got top marks from the Ocean Conservancy, based on its improvement in controlling over-fishing.• Alaska’s fishing industry showed the lowest rate of wasted fish in the country, according to an Oceana study.  Officials credited the Bering Sea pollock fishery for its low bycatch rates of less than two percent• The NPFMC dumped its plan to implement quota shares of halibut for charter operators, and took the idea back to the drawing board.• Hearings were held in Anchorage, Kodiak and Ketchikan to gather input on the nation’s primary fish law — the Magnuson Stevens Conservation and Management Act. The comments from Alaska will be used to shape U.S. fisheries policy for years to come.• A total of 505 applicants were issued quota shares for one or more of the Bering Sea’s eight crab fisheries. Twenty five of those were processing companies; the others were vessel owners, skippers and some crew members.• The Bering Sea crab rationalization program was launched on schedule in the fall. The resulting number of lost jobs and impacts on marine businesses sent shock waves through coastal communities.• Shares of red king crab topped $30 per pound at quota brokerages.• Discovery Channel film crews again braved crab fishing in the Bering sea as part of its popular “Deadliest Catch” series. Discovery also took viewers along for the ride on rescue missions by the U.S. Coast Guard, featuring teams from Kodiak.• Alaska policy makers stalled and then continued their push to lift the state’s ban on industrial mixing zones in waters where fish spawn.• The University of Alaska/Anchorage launched a line of seafood business courses available to all students via the Internet.• Seafood groups rallied to help their counterparts in areas ravaged by hurricane Katrina. They formed the Alaska Fishing Industry Relief Mission at the urging of Senator Lisa Murkowski. The city of Valdez donated a 60-ton marine travel lift to help move stranded boats back to the fishing grounds.• A report by seafood buyers for top U.S. restaurants and supermarkets said well managed, sustainable fisheries will play an increasing role in corporate buying decisions.• For the 16th year in a row, Dutch Harbor topped the list as the nation’s No. 1 port for seafood landings (886.4 million pounds of fish and shellfish valued at $155 million).Fish linersThe year 2006 marks the 15th year that I have been writing this column, which highlights news of Alaska’s seafood industry. Each year, I make selections on what I view as the most notable “fish liners:”Biggest Fish Folly: Alaska’s proposal to foul its fish streams by lifting the ban on mixing zones.Best fish movers and shakers:   The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute’s Cook it Frozen campaign; Star of Kodiak for getting pink salmon into top restaurants in Washington, D.C.Biggest fish about-face: The North Pacific Council’s shift on halibut quota shares for charter operators.Biggest fish dilemma: Dividing up groundfish catches in the Gulf of Alaska.Best fishcrat: Denby Lloyd, former and present state director of Commercial Fisheries.Best “it’s about time” appointment: Patti Nelson of Kodiak, first female CommFish deputy director.Biggest fish blooper: Local hotels and restaurants that do not feature Alaska seafood.Best fish groupies: Kodiak-based crew members for organizing to fight for their stake of rationalized fisheries.Best new fish product: waterless transport for live fish by Bonifacio Comandante of the Phillipines. The process could cut shipping costs by 75 percent.Scariest fish story: Offshore aquaculture.Biggest fish flaps:  Senator Ben Stevens.Baddest fish attitude: see above.Worst fish pitch to the industry: SB 113.Biggest Fish Story:  The Bering Sea’s rationalized crab management plan. Time will tell.<COL>2005 a big year for fish industry<COL>2006-01-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/05/rationalization-data-is-troubling/<COL>Rationalization data is troublingBy Laine WelchBy design, the slower pace of a “rationalized” fishery is supposed to help preserve and protect the stocks. But that was not the case for the first fishery that operated under the new Bering Sea crab plan.The industry received the troubling news in a report just released by state biologists titled: “Estimates of Red King Crab Bycatch during the 2005/2006 Bristol Bay Red King Crab Fishery with Comparisons to the 1999-2004 Seasons.”The report concluded that data collected “provided no indication that the first fishery completed under the crab rationalization program achieved the goal of reducing bycatch and discarding females and sub-legal males.”Based on observer data obtained during last fall’s three-month fishery, an estimated 5.8 million king crabs were returned to the sea, or a whopping 68 percent of the total catch limit. Small male crabs made up the largest component of discards at 53 percent, while females accounted for 35 percent of the bycatch.Even more troubling was the amount of legal-sized male crabs that were tossed overboard — 20 percent of all captured, according to crab biologist Doug Pengilly with the AK Dept. of Fish and Game in Kodiak, who co-authored the report with biometrician David Barnard. That adds up to nearly 700,000 crabs, or 3.6 million pounds out of the 18.3 million. A practice called high grading was a main driver behind the dump of market size crab.“The real correlate with whether a legal crab was retained or not was its shell condition,” said Pengilly, referring to the new or old appearance of the crab shells. Many industry reports said the number of barnacle encrusted king crab was also quite high. Simply put, processors paid higher prices for better looking product and the result was wide-spread high grading.Fishery managers are also concerned about increased pot lifts in the red king crab fishery. “If more legal crabs are being discarded, that results in an increased number of pot lifts to get to the catch quota. That also increases the handling mortality of female and small crabs,” Pengilly said.Crab scientists estimate that as much as 25 percent of all discarded crabs die. Accordingly, managers have suggested a 25 percent drop in this year’s red king crab catch quota in order to ensure conservation of the resource. According to market analyst John Sackton, that reduction could cost each boat $20,000 — $30,000 from the fishery this year.Meanwhile, industry members and managers are already discussing ways to improve the crab discard problem. Many crabbers are calling for 100 percent retention of legal king crab, and fleet-wide use of more selective fishing gear.Find the Pengilly/Barnard report at www.sf.adfg. state.ak.us/FedAidPDFs/fds06-23.pdf.Smart gear winnersMagnets, flexi-grids and flying bottle brushes were the winning bycatch reduction ideas in this year’s international Smart Gear competition.A first prize of $25,000 went to Michael Hermann of New Jersey, whose gear idea takes advantage of a shark’s unique ability to detect magnetic fields through its snout. He placed strong magnets just above baited hooks on longlines, and found that it repelled sharks, while not affecting catches of tuna and swordfish. Longlines are the most widespread fishing gear, and Smart Gear judges said Hermann’s idea addresses a problem that affects sharks around the world. It’s estimated that 20 percent of all shark species are nearing extinction, and bycatch is a major contributor to the decline.Two other inventions were awarded $5,000 prizes. Kristian Zachariassen of the Faroe Islands created a light, flexible filter grid that is inserted into a trawl net. A flying bottlebrush that scares away sea birds was the other winning idea. Invented by Chris Carey of New Zealand, the gear consists of a rope that is clipped onto  cables that pull trawl nets through the water.The Smart Gear competition was created by the World Wildlife Fund to reward and inspire innovative ideas to reduce bycatch of all kinds in fisheries. This year’s contest attracted 83 entries from 26 countries, including four from Alaska.Sea lice spreadSea lice from salmon farms do indeed transfer to wild fish, and the spread is more far-reaching than people thought. For years, many have dismissed that claim, but the precise science used in a British Columbia study makes the findings irrefutable.Dr. Mark Lewis, a mathematical ecologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, and grad student Marty Krkosek were able to isolate the effect of a single fish farm on infection levels in wild salmon. The farm was anchored in an isolated fjord that the wild fish had to pass on their seaward migration.Lewis and his team tested 12,000 live juvenile pink and chum salmon over a range of 40 miles. The tests showed that the fish had no sea lice prior to the farm. Lice infection levels became 73 times higher than normal when the salmon neared the farm, and remained high for the duration of the 40-mile migration route. Overall, the study showed sea lice levels from the salmon farm were 30,000 times higher than natural conditions and they spread out fast.Sea lice are parasites that live in the slime that covers the fish.  The lice create open lesions on the fish surface; when their numbers are high enough, the lice literally eat the fish alive. The sea lice study, which hit the scientific press in February, has already prompted unprecedented cooperation between fish farmers and wild harvesters, neither of whom want sea lice. In British Columbia, Marine Harvest, one of Canada’s major fish farmers,  said it will move its adult salmon to a site far away from migration routes. Similar moves of “area management agreements” are also being reported in Norway and Scotland. The B.C. sea lice and salmon study, which was funded by Canada’s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, appeared in the April edition of Fisherman Life magazine.<COL>Rationalization data is troubling<COL>2006-05-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/05/fishermen-health-care-in-works/<COL>Fishermen health care in worksBy Laine WelchFishermen and their families could soon have access to affordable health insurance if a proposed measure gets the nod from Congress.Representatives Barney Frank and John Tierney of Massachusetts have introduced legislation that includes funding for fishermen’s health care. It calls for funding at three different levels, according to J.J. Bartlett, president of the Fishing Partnership Health Plan based in Newton, Mass.“The first level would be for research and strategic planning so the fishing community in each state would have the opportunity to gather demographic information on their fishing families, and create a plan suited to their state. The next level is for implementation of the plan, and the third tier is for ongoing operation. It is a gradual progression of funding that would allow every U.S. fishing family the opportunity to research, plan and then run a health care program in their own state,” Bartlett said in a phone interview.The national plan is modeled after a successful program called the Fishing Partnership Health Plan that began in Massachusetts in 1997. A combination of federal ($3.8 million since 1997) and state funding ($3 million annually through 2007) has been used to leverage private investment by making monthly health insurance premiums affordable to an underserved population.“Fishermen are three to four times more likely than the national average to be uninsured,” Bartlett said.Prior to the start of the Massachusetts program , 43 percent of the state’s fishermen had no health insurance. That figure has now been reduced to 13 percent. Bartlett said fishermen pay 60 percent of the cost for a very comprehensive plan that covers preventive care, office visits, medications, chiropractic, mental health and substance abuse services and emergency treatment anywhere in the world.“Because the fishermen pay the majority of the cost, we’ve been able to show that for every one dollar of federal funding we have spent, we’ve save the government $4.15,” Bartlett said.He added that payments are based on a sliding scale, and participants must show that they receive more than half of their annual income from fishing.The plan at the national level is included in proposed language in reauthorization of the nation’s primary fish laws: the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA). The legislation, listed under H.R. 4940, Section (e) is called the Fishing Industry Health Care Demonstration Program. Bartlett stresses that it is critical that the measure is included in the final version of the MSA, which is scheduled to be completed this year.“We can’t allow fishermen’s health care to get lost in the larger debate over this legislation,” he said. “I urge every fishing family in the United States to write a letter and fax it to their senators and representatives telling them to make sure the language is included in the final version. Then, when it is passed, the funding will be there for the research, planning, implementation and ongoing operation of a high quality, affordable health plan for all fishermen and their families,” Bartlett said.Mark Vinsel, director of the United Fishermen of Alaska agrees (http://www.ufa-fish.org/mo.htm).“UFA has recognized the need for fishermen’s health care for years. Ultimately, this program could be a cost savings to the state and medical providers, especially in rural areas,” Vinsel said.He added that UFA has been in contact with senators Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Don Young in support of the health care program. The newly formed Commercial Fishermen of America (http://www.cfafish.org/) is also backing the effort.“If we all work together, we can get this done,” said J.J. Bartlett.

The award was developed to recognize groups and individuals who have advanced conservation and earth-friendly use of U.S. marine resources.Senator Ted Stevens received the Special Recognition Award for his advocacy for science-based management, and for working tirelessly to win the support of the U.S. Congress for the laws that form the basis of federal management and conservation programs.The Pollock Conservation Cooperative, comprising boats of the At-Sea Processors Association, received the Stewardship and Sustainability Award for voluntarily dividing up annual quotas among its fishing companies. This led to reduced bycatch and “resulted in a 50 percent increase in the amount of pollock products made from each pound of harvested fish,” according to a NOAA press release.Holland American Line received the Conservation Partnership Award for taking the initiative to develop and promote the adoption of international whale avoidance measures.Ed Melvin of the Washington Sea Grant Program received the Science, Research and Technology Award for working with industry to develop sea bird avoidance methods in longline fisheries. Melvin’s research has reduced bycatch of sea birds by at least 80 percent and is being used as a model in world fisheries.SeaShare received the Public Education, Community Service and Media Award for working with the fishing industry to develop a hunger relief program. Since 1994, SeaShare has partnered with 60 companies to donate 20 million pounds of fish to food banks that would otherwise have been thrown overboard by federal regulation. The awards will be presented to all winners in Washington, D.C. on June 5th.FISH FAREWELL – John Doyle, one of the nation’s first Sea Grant advisory agents, has passed away. Doyle was the most outspoken advocate for, among other things, improving salmon quality. He used vivid pictures to show bruising and other damage to fish by walking on them, handling them by the tail, or tossing them, especially how it appeared to end users at retail counters. Doyle stressed that chilling fish is critical and believed that “nothing is better than ice, and plenty of it.”  Doyle was the first to drive home the point that “fish is food,” and coined the now standard phrase: “Keep it clean, keep it cold and keep it moving.”“John was bull-headed and opposite in personality of your run-of-the-mill university or government bureaucrat. He was public spirited and got things done, and he did not care much about who he alienated while getting it done,” said National Sea Grant education and outreach leader, Jim Murray in an e-mail tribute.In other fish related health news: Bill Atkinson suffered a massive stroke last week.

This year, the plan is to be “more inclusive” by launching a local salmon celebration at home.Once again, catches of the first sockeye salmon of the season will be flown to Kodiak City from remote sites shortly after the fishery opens at noon on June 1. Chenet will immediately begin preparing the fish into an elaborate dinner (titled “Setnet Trilogy”) that includes salmon soup with salmon dumplings, salmon kiev with king crab veloute, salmon poached in spring rhubarb juice with Alutiiq seasonings and salmonberry mousse cakes.The First Salmon celebration will include much more than fine dining. Before dinner, guests will be greeted by the Alutiiq Dancers, and elders from the community will share the cultural significance of Kodiak’s first fish of the season among other special presentations. The meal will also mark the grand opening of the Eagle’s Landing Restaurant at the new Comfort Inn, formerly the Buskin River Inn next to the Kodiak Airport. Proceeds from the Salmon Celebration will go to the Alutiiq Dancers and Kodiak Salmon Camp.It’s about time Kodiak got on the wild-fish bandwagon. The island community is home to the largest and most diverse fishing fleet in Alaska, yet visitors are hard pressed to find much local seafood fare on restaurant menus. According to tourist industry data, that is the No. 1 comment made by visitors to Kodiak.“Kodiak has a seafood commodities mentality. If it’s not being sold in 40,000-pound van loads, it doesn’t matter. And the sentiment that everyone on Kodiak gets their own fish is a myth. Lots of people simply don’t go out and catch their own salmon or halibut or crab,” said a local processor who asked to remain anonymous.But that is finally beginning to change, said Dave Kaplan, a film maker and project manager for the Star of Kodiak, a local quality assurance program that is co-sponsoring the First Salmon Celebration.“Kodiak is a sleeping giant in terms of its fish. All we need is to collaborate on more local events like this to get people to recognize that we have the best seafood and salmon in the world. Three thousand Kodiak bears can’t be wrong,” Kaplan added with a laugh.Chef Chenet, who along with his Mill Bay Coffee and Pastry Shop will be operating the Eagle’s Landing Restaurant, said the Kodiak Salmon Celebration would be the “first of many firsts.” Along with salmon, he intends to begin annual promotions for the first landings of Kodiak cod, halibut, rockfish, crab and other local seafood.

The chefs were selected because of their dedication to promoting and supporting wild Alaska seafood at their restaurants. Other chefs in the Alaska competition are Naomi Everett of Settler’s Bay Lodge in Wasilla, David Moorehead of the Baranof Hotel in Juneau and  Patrick Hoogerhyde of Orso in Anchorage.

Researchers at Old Dominion University and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science have found that lobsters will avoid infected individuals even before they show any symptoms of disease. The scientists speculate the lobsters are prompted by their sense of smell, and the tactic may limit the spread of disease in the wild. The results of the study are in the May edition of Nature magazine.As food makers scramble to meet the growing demand for healthier products, they are coming up with some unique combinations.

Results showed that it can extend the shelf life several days when used at retail locations.“Watch out Copper River — here comes Kodiak!”That’s the rallying  cry of a small but passionate group that is intent on creating the kind  of excitement for Kodiak salmon that Cordova has cornered for its  famous Copper River fish.Islanders are launching an inaugural  “First Salmon of the Season Celebration” on June 1, an idea spawned by  chef Joel Chenet, Kodiak’s most outspoken advocate for all local  seafood.<COL>Kodiak targets high-end market<COL>2006-05-31<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/06/deveining-alaska-fish-codes/<COL>Deveining Alaska fish codesby Maggie WallWhen you buy fish at the market — and I do hope you buy lots of Alaska fish products — you may notice unfamiliar words and numbers on the package. Deciphering those fish hieroglyphics is the key to getting the best buy and the best product for your particular use.Seafood is often identified and sold by weight. For instance a package of shrimp may say something like 36 to 45. That means there 36-45 pieces of shrimp per pound in that package—pretty small ones, actually. Or maybe the package says 11 to15 which means about a dozen per pound and quite a bit larger than the previous package.Another thing to keep in mind with shrimp is peeling and deveining — also called P-and-D. Peeling and deveining removes about half the weight. So a package of jumbo 11 to 15 P&D shrimp contains bigger shrimp than a package of 11 to 15 unpeeled.A good rule of thumb for shrimp is use the smaller for soups and salads. The larger ones are better for eating individually and in kabobs.Now, on to scallops. Scallops are also measured and sold on a per pound method. Scallops might carry a U-10 label which means there are 10 Units per pound. Units being the part that you eat, which really is a muscle that holds the two scallop shells together. Sometimes people call these muscles “buttons”.And here’s something we really should clear up about scallops. Scallops are sold by the weight of the shucked meat. No shells.  They have lovely shells, but you’re not likely to find any meat for sale in a shell because scallops are shucked right on deck long before the tasty buttons find their way to shore.Next time you buy scallops, remember those industrious crewmembers popping open those shells and shucking out those buttons. Talk about a lot of work. Talk about sore hands!!Crab sales are based on a poundage formula with a bit of a twist. For instance King Crab legs are sold by the number of legs per 10 pound box. King Crab legs weigh close to a pound each, so a 9 to 12 designation means you’re getting 9 to 12 legs per 10 pound box.Snow Crab, on the other hand, are sold based on the number of clusters in a 20 pound box.  A cluster being the leg and the part of the body where the leg connects. Oh, and sometimes Snow Crab are sold in 30 pound boxes, and sometimes they are sold whole. However you buy them, they sure taste good.Sometimes the fish you buy will be labeled IQF — not to be confused with IFQs. IQF stands for Individually Quick Frozen. Pollock is often sold in shatter packs with each fillet individually frozen and packed with other pollock fillets to make up a certain poundage. These are great for individual dinner servings as most pollock fillets are 2 to 4 ounces in size. It’s also a good way to buy in bulk since a 10 or 15-pound shatter pack gets you scads of individually frozen fillets that you can pull out of the freezer as you need them.In Kodiak, the processors often donate IQF fish to nonprofits for various fund raisers and raffles.There could be a reason people think of frozen pollock as big chunks of fish. Most Alaska pollock are sold not to individuals, but to big firms that make countless fish chips, fish sticks, and fish sandwiches. Now these folks actually prefer their pollock frozen in big heavy blocks. The pollock compressed into frozen blocks are cut into uniform chunks while still frozen, then are breaded, and turned into the familiar sticks. No futzing with the individual fish and the compression combined with the freezing compacts the pieces together enough without squashing so they can be cut into whatever size or shape required.And if all that seafood lingo wasn’t confusing enough, you could opt for surimi made to look and taste like shellfish. Surimi is made from Alaska pollock that is finely chopped and rinsed many times before being formed into a white paste that can be colored and flavored to imitate any number of fish—such as shrimp, scallop and crab.Which brings us back to where we started. And you thought fish regulations were confusing.FISHING BOATS IN BRISTOL BAY will be flying flags this summer protesting the proposed Pebble Mine. The flag statement is sponsored in part by the Alaska Independent Fishermen’s Marketing Association located in Seattle which plans to distribute the flags showing the words Pebble Mine with a red X through it at various events and locations around Bristol Bay.Nearly 33 million sockeye salmon are expected to return to the bay in the next several weeks and fishers fear the mine could jeopardize future fisheries by destroying the pristine waters of the region. Like anything involving jobs and livelihoods, the mine is a hot topic with people on both sides. Those supporting the mine say it will bring a lot of good paying jobs to the region.AIFMA is the largest salmon fishing association in Bristol Bay. Other sponsors include Peter Pan Seafoods and the Renewable Resources Coalition.YET ANOTHER GOOD REPORT on the health benefits of fish oil came out this week. Sydney researchers say people who eat low levels of fish oil are more likely to suffer mood disorders and neurological disorders.The Australian Associated Press reports on Intrafish.com the results of a study by Sydney’s Black Dog Institute. The study found mothers with higher levels of Omega 3 fatty acids were less likely to suffer post partum depression. Lead researcher Gordon Parker told the Australian A-P that his work “found Omega-3 fish oil supplements could be used effectively alongside antidepressants for people suffering depression.”Parker also notes that more research is needed to figure out the best ratio of Omega 3s and the best dosage for maximum results.<COL>Deveining Alaska fish codes<COL>2006-06-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/07/crab-market-declining/<COL>Crab market decliningAlaska’s crab season in the Bering Sea will officially get underway with the Aug. 15 start of the golden king crab fishery. Just 14 crabbers own rights to that deep water fishery under the new quota share system that began last year, although only eight boats usually participate. Golden king crab, which is slightly smaller than red kings and has a more delicate, sweet flavor, is one of Alaska’s most stable stocks and for years has maintained a catch of 5.7 million pounds.Unfortunately, all signs point to a continued downward press in world king crab markets. Blame it on the jumbos coming in from the new Russian fishery in the Barents Sea, said market expert John Sackton.“That Russian crab has had a huge impact on the crab market, and I don’t see any change in that situation this coming year,” he said.The crab was transplanted to the Barents Sea by Russians about 60 years ago. Since then, the stocks have boomed. The region, saddled atop Russia and Norway, now supports a fishery that is about the same size as Alaska’s, and it’s likely to get even bigger. The king crab, which has only been arriving on world markets in recent years, is huge – the average weight is ten pounds, but it can top 20 pounds, compared to about six pounds for Alaska red king crab. And nearly all of it is coming into the U.S.“That’s taken the high end of the market and pushed it down really hard because there is such an over supply,” Sackton said, adding that this summer wholesalers are selling the jumbo crab to retailers at $7.65 to $7.75 per pound, far lower than last year.Market analyst Ken Talley agreed. “Prices for the large red kings are beginning to strengthen a bit, but only for the (most popular) 6-9 and 9-12 size sections. All the rest continues to be an over supply and there simply is no home for it with the cheap red kings around,” Talley said.  (King crab is sold by the number of legs per 10 pound box, so 9-12 means the legs are close to one pound each. The Barents Sea crab is mostly 4-6, 6-9 size sections. The most common sizes coming out of Alaska are 12-14 and 14-17 sections.)The total U.S. supply of king crab is about 27,000 metric tons (60 million pounds), of which Alaska in 2005 provided only about 12 percent (3,000 – 4,000 tons). All the rest comes from Russia. Sackton said a wild card is the status of the king crab market in Japan, where smaller crab is preferred. Alaska typically provides roughly 2,400 – 3,000 tons to Japan.On a brighter note, the crunch in the king crab market is not likely to be permanent. “Anytime new crab comes into the world market, it throws things off kilter for awhile. A lot of old timers will remember in 1991 the serious depression of king crab coming from the Russian Far East fishery. Two or three years later, there were record prices,” Sackton said.And in a scenario similar to farmed salmon — the fact that there is more king crab around is expanding the number of people who buy it. In the long term, that will bode well for the crab industry, he added.But that’s not much consolation in the short term. “With the spiraling cost of fuel and other expenses, it’s almost not worth going fishing,” said one long time golden king crabber.The average price paid to fishermen for golden kings last year was $2.65 per pound, down from $3.50 in previous years. Alaska red king crab last year averaged $4.50, down 20-cents from the previous year. That fishery begins in mid-October.New fish face in D.C.Fisherman and fisheries policy maker Arne Fuglvog of Petersburg will hang up his gear and head directly to our nation’s capital as the new fisheries aide to U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Fuglvog replaces long time aide Bill Woolf, who is retiring.“I wasn’t out looking for another job, but the opportunity became available and I couldn’t pass it up,” Fuglvog said in a phone interview shortly after the Senator made the announcement on Thursday.“Arne has a reputation as a quick study, a consensus builder and hard worker who has the interest of Alaska fishermen and coastal communities at heart. He will be a tremendous asset not only to my office but to the whole Alaska fishing community,” Murkowski said in a prepared statement.Fuglvog is a fifth-generation fisherman who has participated in salmon, crab, halibut and many other fisheries for more than 30 years. He said several reasons prompted him to make the switch from fishing to the halls of Congress.“Primarily, it provides the chance to work with someone like Sen. Murkowski who is honest and has integrity and is a tireless worker for Alaska, and a strong supporter of the fishing industry. Secondly, I can continue my work in fisheries policy, and lastly, for some personal reasons. I’ve been really struggling with trying to fish so much and spending a few months in meetings each year,” he said.Fuglvog has been the only active fisherman on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council since 2003. Prior to that he was an advisor to the 15 member panel for nine years. The NPFMC sets the rules for all fisheries in federal waters from three to 200 miles off the coast of Alaska.“That was my biggest heartburn — the fact that I like the council process and I believe that having an active fishermen involved is  important,” he said.Fuglvog said he commends fishermen for becoming proactive and bringing new ideas to the process.“The council pays close attention and is always listening for things that can be incorporated into different management plans. I do bristle a bit when I hear people say they are ignoring the public, because I think the council is responsive,” he said.Fuglvog said some of the immediate challenges facing the fishing industry are reauthorization of the nation’s primary fish law, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the movement towards offshore aquaculture and continuing seafood marketing efforts.<COL>Crab market declining<COL>2006-07-26<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/06/halibut-prices-hold-strong/<COL>Halibut prices hold strongBy Maggie WallIt used to be that halibut prices would drop each summer when other fisheries got underway. But no longer — prices for halibut started off in early March well over $3 a pound in most ports — and there they’ve remained.The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute reports halibut prices remain at or above $3.50 per pound for most ports.Landings are also up around the state. Halibut landings in the four weeks between May 8 and June 7 exceeded the previous three-year average by 1.3 million pounds or roughly 13 percent.This suggests that demand for halibut continues to grow — with prices holding strong despite the significant increase in supply.Homer leads all other ports for halibut landings, followed by Seward and Kodiak which are neck-and-neck at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots. Sitka and Juneau round out the top five ports.As of June 15, Homer saw 4.4 million pounds of halibut cross its dock. Seward had 3.8 million pounds delivered, followed by Kodiak with 3.75 million pounds.As of mid-June 44 percent of the available halibut allocation was landed. Nearly 30 million more pounds remains on the table with five months left in the fishery.Cod prices could jumpAlaska boasts one of the world’s most abundant cod fisheries and this year nearly 500 million pounds will be harvested from the Bering Sea. Another 150-million pounds will be added from the Gulf of Alaska.As with its other fish, Alaska cod competes in a global market. What is bad news for other parts of the world could be good news for Alaska fishermen.  Industry reports are already predicting higher prices for the cod, the world’s most popular fish, because of crashing stocks in the Barents Sea.The Barents is an extremely deep part of the Arctic Ocean located north of Norway and the Russian far west. Wikipedia.com reports that it was named for the Dutch Navigator Willem Barents. The southern half of the sea remains ice free in winter and is the location of the Russian port of Murmansk, which was the home of the Soviet’s submarine fleet during the Cold War and is the headquarters for Russians Northern Fleet today. The Barents Sea is a popular location for action in techno-thriller novels in part because of the Russian fleet, but also because it is said to be a dumping ground for old Soviet nuclear waste.Thanks to the warm waters of the North Atlantic drift, the Barents is an amazingly productive region in terms of fisheries. It is one of the world’s largest cod sources providing a vital part of both Norway’s and Russia’s fish supply.Intrafish reports that the cod quota in the Barents Sea could be cut by roughly one-third next year. International managers from 19 countries are recommending that Barents Sea cod, fished mainly by Norway and Russia, be slashed by roughly one-third to 680 million pounds — a drop of 356 million from this year.Managers say one of the biggest problems is illegal fishing activity, estimated at one-quarter of the total catch. Barents Sea cod accounts for most of the cod used in Europe. Some buyers will switch to other whitefish like pollock, but cod’s strong tradition means many will buy it no matter what the price.In other cod newsFishermen in Newfoundland will be allowed to catch cod for the first time in three years. The catch limit there is just 5 million pounds. Seafood.com says that region used to average catches of nearly 600 million pounds in the 1980s. The cod crash cost more than 30,000 people their jobs, the largest mass layoff in Canada’s history.Watch for farmed cod to soon be filling some of the market demand for the world’s most popular fish. Farmed production in Norway, for example, is pegged at 26 million pounds this year. Industry watchers predict that in just 10 years, world-farmed cod production could top 440 million pounds.Norway has been experimenting with farming codfish since the 1980s, and now they are pulling out all stops.   Intrafish reports that last year, farmed cod production in Norway topped 13 million pounds, a figure that is projected to double this year. Norway wants to become the world leader in cod farming and major producers are gathering capital to expand fast.Earlier this month, Grieg Company in Bergen, Norway generated 26 million dollars in a first initial public stock offering to back cod farming.  Scotland is also experimenting with large-scale organic cod farming. Closer to home, Cooke Aquaculture has 70-thousand codfish swimming in sea cages off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada.  According to the local Telegraph Journal, Cooke workers have applied some salmon know-how to cod, but they’ve found that the fish behave and grow differently. Cod are said to be a more gentle fish and eat more slowly.Cooke’s market-size cod weigh in at an average of about five pounds after two years.  Cooke Aquaculture introduced its first significant farmed-cod harvest last month at the International Boston Seafood Show.Newsletter halts publicationSeafood Trends Newsletter is once again available after a brief halt in publication while its editor and publisher pursued a new opportunity outside the fishing industry.

It’s done through participation in local county committees and the call is out for fishermen to fill some of those seats.“County committees are designed from a grassroots level to hear how our programs are working and to get ideas on how we can better fit communities and areas around the country. They also provide information about USDA programs,” said Chad Padgett, director of the USDA Farm Service Agency in Alaska.USDA programs, such as Farm Service Loans at 3.5 percent, are implemented with input from the local FSA County Committees. Various marketing programs are also included. The FSA County Committee program was restructured last year, dividing Alaska into northern and southern regions, each with five local administrative areas.Ten county committee seats are up for grabs. Members are paid for their time at meetings and reimbursed for travel. Meetings are held monthly or as needed. Salmon fishermen who applied for USDA TAA are eligible to serve on the committees, and can nominate themselves or others. Deadline is Aug. 1.

Weathervane scallops are the largest scallops in the world and are the only species caught commercially in Alaska at this time.Scallop fishing began in Alaska in the late 1960’s around Kodiak and Yakutat, and now also occurs at  Prince William Sound, Kamishak Bay, the south side of the Alaska Peninsula and in the Bering Sea.Alaska scallop harvests average roughly 700,000 pounds of shucked meats. Alaska scallops have an average value of between $5.50 and $5.90 per pound, making the fishery worth up to $4 million at the docks.<COL>Seafood stars in media show<COL>2006-07-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/06/newest-baby-food-flavor-salmon/<COL>Newest baby food flavor: salmonBy Laine WelchCruise the baby food aisles of any American supermarket and you’ll see jars of beef, chicken, lamb, eggs — every kind of protein except fish.  That could soon change if an initiative by Alaska food scientists and the seafood industry is successful.Fueled by $443,000 in federal funding from the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, a project is underway at the University of Alaska Fisheries Industrial Technology Center at Kodiak to create baby food made from salmon. AFDF is an industry- based nonprofit created in 1978 to help provide a bridge between fisheries research and the marketplace.“Starting last year we began developing two prototype products — a pate form for infants and a chunk style food for toddlers made from pink and/or sockeye salmon, with or without fish oil additives. We may also use ground up salmon bone as a source for organic calcium,” said FITC director, Dr. Scott Smiley. Another project will focus on using salmon roe as a baby food ingredient.Smiley said it will be two or three years before the salmon products are ready to hand off to baby food manufacturers. But that is something that is beyond the realm of science.“We can tell seafood processors what they need to do to make a product that is 100 percent pure salmon and meets specific nutritional standards. It’s up to them to sell the idea to baby food manufacturers, and to market researchers to try and make it fly in the market place,” Smiley said.Smiley displayed jars of seafood baby food from Japan adorned with labels showing colorful pictures of flounders and cod. He said infant formulas throughout Asia also contain fish oils to meet minimum requirements for omega three fatty acid levels. With all the health positives surrounding fish, why is the same nutrition not available to American babies?“We can’t get it past the gate-keepers. Parents just seem to have a bias against fish,” was the response 10 years ago by Gerber spokesperson Nancy Lindner. That attitude holds true today. “At this time, Gerber does not manufacture a baby food containing fish. The selection of products we offer is determined in large part by the preferences of parents,” was the reply to a query at Gerber’s consumer questions line. (Other companies did not respond.)One baby food company expressed concern over the “odor” of processing fish at their manufacturing plants, said AFDF director Bob Pawlowski.  To that end, AFDF has invited food scientists from major baby food makers to visit processing plants next month in Kodiak and one other Alaska community.“We want to show them that we have the most healthful, all natural salmon in the world with no bio-accumulation issues of contaminants or impurities. We will try and convince them that we can produce it and they can distribute it,” Pawlowski said. He and Dr. Smiley have already scheduled follow up meetings in August with research and development staff at baby food companies headquartered in Urbana, Illinois.Both men are optimistic that salmon baby food is an idea whose time has come. Smiley said, “Moms recognize it as healthful, low fat, loaded with omega threes, it comes from pure Alaska waters … there is a whole lot going for fish. It just depends on how willing people are to make that vision translate into new products on the supermarket shelves.”New rules affect Coast GuardMariners have long been required to take steps to test anyone involved in a serious accident or incident for evidence of drug and alcohol use. Many might be caught off guard by new U.S. Coast Guard rules that go into effect on June 20 which set specific time limits for conducting the tests, and mandate that approved testing equipment must be carried on board.The new requirements say that alcohol testing must follow a serious marine incident (SMI) within two hours, and no later than eight hours, following the incident. Drug testing must be done within 32 hour of an SMI. (An SMI includes such things as a death, an injury that requires treatment beyond first aid, property damage in excess of $100,000, loss of a vessel, or various pollution incidents.)Lt. Randy Waddington said the Coast Guard recognizes that sometimes testing can’t be done within the required time frame, as when “people are being plucked out of the ocean.”“Enforcement will be done on a case by case basis,” Waddington said. Regardless, mariners must have approved testing devices on board by June 20 and know how to use them.   The only exception is for vessels operating within two hours of a location where testing can be done, such as a police station or hospital, he added.Waddington was not sure if the devices will be available from outlets other than the Internet. A list of approved testing equipment, which sells for $100-$150, is available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/alcohol/blood.Failure to comply with the new chemical testing regulations can result in fines of $27,500 for each violation.New sea bird guidesAn ongoing collaboration between the Juneau-based Marine Conservation Alliance and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has produced a new series of colorful placards showing 51 bird species that might be encountered on the fishing grounds. The guides contain life-size outlines of the birds’ beaks so they can easily be identified by fishermen or onboard observers.The new series follows on a release last year of guides produced in both English and Russian that identify three types of endangered short tailed albatross. Accidentally catching just four of those in a two year period can have serious ramifications, potentially closing down a fishery.“Happily, we have not gotten close to those limits. We have not taken a short tailed albatross since 1998,” said Thorn Smith, director of the North Pacific Longline Association.Alaska’s longline fleet already uses avoidance measures to keep sea birds away from their fishing gear.“The streamer lines we deploy over our baited hooks while we’re setting them out are extremely effective and we have reduced our incidental take of birds eight fold,” Smith said, adding that the bird guides have been very popular.Find  more information on the Web at  www.marineconservationalliance.org.<COL>Newest baby food flavor: salmon<COL>2006-06-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/03/ice-free-fish-packing-could-save-huge-costs/<COL>Ice-free fish packing could save huge costsLaine WelchShipping live or fresh fish without water or ice would save millions of dollars for seafood companies. A new waterless transport method could soon allow fish shippers to do just that.Waterless transport technology has won several international “best invention” awards for Bonifacio Comandante of the Philippines, who presented the concept as his master’s thesis two years ago at a San Francisco university. Since then, investors from Australia and Japan have partnered with Comandante to bring the benefits and savings to their countries.Comandante’s transport process involves bathing fish in a proprietary ‘buhi blend’ that puts them in a soothing state of hibernation.“It’s an organic compound found naturally in the water, and I just found a way to trigger a hibernation process in fish,” Comandante said in a phone interview last week as he was on his way to the International Boston Seafood Show.The hibernating fishes are kept at a controlled temperature and shipped upright in a vertical position to ensure that their gill covers remain open. Comandante said he has tested the transport method on 12 species of fish with 100 percent success.“From the Philippines, we’re shipping three kinds of groupers, two kinds of snappers and many crustaceans and mollusks,” he said, estimating the savings from Southeast Asia to Hong Kong at $85 million for live products.The inventor recently signed a $4 million contract to apply the technology to Australia’s top seafood exports to the U.S. and Japan: tuna, rainbow trout and salmon.“In Australia, we were successful in putting live salmon into hibernation for 10 to 12 hours,” he said.Comandante said his buhi blend shipping method has an even bigger application for fresh fish because it eliminates the need for ice.“Normally when you send fresh fish you need ice to go along with the fish. Without ice, you save somewhere between 20-25 percent in freight costs,” he said. “If you figure the volume that is traded worldwide that goes to Hong Kong, China and Japan, the instant savings would be about $248 million,” he said. The buhi blend can also be applied to fish processing.“You can time the death of the fishes before you process them,” Comandante explained.His Philippines-based company, Buhi International Group, is awaiting an international patent before fully commercializing the waterless shipping technology in selected countries. Comandante said he is very interested in “networking” with Alaska producers.Meanwhile, the inventor is a finalist in a May 21 World Bank competition for another innovative project that boosts the nutritional content of shellfish by 70 percent. ?“The vitamins and green algae I use make up an acronym for Viagra, but it’s not what you think,” he said with a laugh.

The new nonprofit was created last year when the state and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough donated 28 acres to build the facility, which aims to be the hub for building a global shellfish industry for Alaska shellfish.“Economic development is the primary thing. If we look at what the opportunities are i for year round, sustainable jobs in Southeast, Prince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula and along the Aleutians, the shellfish industry is one of the best options we have. A focus will be on how we can help the industry grow,” said project manager, John Sund.Alaska currently has 34 shellfish farms throughout Southeast Alaska and 27 in the South Central region (Prince William Sound and near Homer). Values last year (primarily oysters) totaled just over $676,000, split almost evenly between the two regions.Sund said if the dive fisheries for geoduck clams, sea cucumbers and urchins are included, total shellfish values for Southeast Alaska top $7 million. Research economists estimate the region’s shellfish value could reach $50 to $100 million if production was increased through aquaculture.Sund believes the state could enjoy similar financial gains and points to New Zealand as an example. “The green mussel industry there struggled for years until they formed a collaboration with the government and researchers and learned how to freeze the mussels. That took them into the world market from $18 million to a $100 million industry,” he said, pointing to similar successes with cultured scallops in Japan, clams in Florida, and oysters and geoduck clams in British Columbia.Ray RaLonde, an aquaculture expert with Alaska Sea Grant, agrees that shellfish aquaculture provides huge opportunities for Alaska. “Right now there is growing demand for Alaska shellfish – what we lack is enough production,” RaLonde said, adding that co-operative farming is the best way for the fledgling industry to move forward.In Ketchikan, projects are already underway even before the Oceans Alaska facility is built.“We don’t need a building to help move the research projects and our mission forward,” Sund said.The Oceans Alaska board is seeking an executive director.

Also, the state Dept. of Natural Resources is accepting applications for shellfish and sea plant farms through April 30.Lost in translationReports from Japanese newspapers that major buyers were bailing out of Alaska’s biggest herring fishery at Bristol Bay were way off base.A thorough canvassing by KDLG revealed that five processors have signed up to purchase Togiak roe herring: Icicle, Trident, Norquest, Yardarm Knot and North Pacific Seafoods. A Norquest spokesman said poor prices and reduced demand for herring have forced processors to scale back their operations in the Togiak fishery, and several will be operating with fewer tenders and a smaller fleet.The Togiak herring quota this year is 26,000 tons, but state fishery manager Tim Sands told KDLG his poll of processors indicates they only intend to buy about 16,000 tons. The Togiak roe herring fishery, which typically gets underway in May, was worth $2.6 million to fishermen last year.<COL>Ice-free fish packing could save huge costs<COL>2007-03-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/04/sea-going-superstitions/<COL>Sea-going superstitionsBy Laine WelchSince 1991, this weekly column has been written on Friday– and this week, it happened to occur on April 13th. Friday the 13th — what better time to search out sea-going superstitions?For centuries, seafarers who face a life of danger and uncertainty have observed a strict set of rules steeped in myth and superstition. Many beliefs are based on the Bible, for example, the well known notion that Friday is the worst day to set out to sea.Most sources credit that to the belief that Christ was crucified on a Friday. Therefore, this day must be observed and respected and will be unlucky for anyone who attempts to go about business as usual. Similarly, Sunday is the best day to begin a voyage, because Christ’s resurrection on that day is regarded as a good omen. Thus the adage, ‘Sunday sail, never fail.’A traditional view for centuries was that women had no place at sea. They weren’t considered strong enough, emotionally or physically, and the men would be distracted from their duties, angering the seas and dooming a ship.Interestingly, lore has it that a naked woman onboard would calm the seas. That’s why many vessels have a bare breasted figurehead of a woman on the bow. Superstition amongst sailors said that the figurehead should have eyes to find a way through the seas when lost, while her bare breast would shame a stormy sea into calm. Pliny, the ancient Roman scientist and historian, first recorded this belief over 2000 years ago.Since the 1700s, bananas have been regarded as bad luck by mariners. One explanation is that bananas carried aboard slave ships fermented and gave off poisonous methane gas. Another is that crewmen would die from lethal spiders hiding in the bunches of bananas.Here’s a sampler of more maritime superstitions:Pouring wine on the deck is a ‘libation to the gods’ that will bring good luck on a long voyage.Dolphins swimming with a ship are a good omen, while sharks following is a sign of inevitable death. Black cats are considered lucky on board a boat. Not so for flowers, which could be used for a funeral wreath.It’s unlucky to kill an albatross or a gull at sea, as they host the souls of dead sailors. Whistling on the bridge will whistle up a storm. Cutting your hair or nails at sea is a no no. Likewise, don’t ever step onto a boat with your left foot, or stir a pot or coil a line counter clockwise.Finally, marine myth has it that sailors pierced their ears to improve their eyesight. A gold earring was both a charm against drowning and the price paid to Davy Jones to enter the next world if a sailor died at sea.As for Friday the 13thmodern stories claim that legend began when King Philip of France has many Christian knights arrested on October 13, 1307. Other resources say that although the number 13 was considered historically unlucky, the association of Friday and 13 seems to be an invention from the early 1900s.A Friday occurring on the 13th of any month is considered to be a day of bad luck in English, German and Portuguese speaking cultures around the world.  The fear of Friday the 13th is called paraskavedekatriaphobia, derived from the Greek words Friday, thirteen and phobia. July is the only other month in 2007 in which a Friday falls on the 13th.Workers wantedThe call is out for 1,400 seafood processing workers for fisheries all across Alaska.“Yardarm Knot, Pederson Point and Togiak Fisheries are recruiting 350 workers now for the Bristol Bay herring fishery that begins in early May. The At-sea Processors Association has a job fair in Anchorage on April 19th.  Petersburg Fisheries is recruiting for 300 salmon workers all summer, and Westward and Unisea are recruiting for the pollock season that begins in June,” said Laurie Fuglvog, employment analyst for the state Labor Department.Most of the seafood processing jobs are entry level, but many go well beyond the slime line. “Right now we have openings for quality control technicians, cooks, electricians, plant managers, production managers, refrigeration mechanics, engineers, machinists, fresh fish coordinators, all sorts of jobs that pay well and lots of them last three to six months or more,” Fuglvog said.“The seafood processing industry is one where you can work your way up to higher paying, skilled and managerial positions. Almost everyone starts at the entry level,” she added. Fuglvog said jobs in the seafood industry provide a great opportunity for high school seniors who are turning 18 and “want to see different parts of Alaska and establish a work history.”Sign up at any Alaska Job Center, or call a seafood employment specialist toll free at 800-473- 0688.

Most of the seafood is caught in remote regions far from any roads and air freight is pretty much the only way to go – if planes aren’t grounded due to weather.The lousy logistics often mean no way to tap into higher end, fresh fish markets for harvesters in Western Alaska, ranging from the Aleutians westward to the Yukon and Norton Sound. But one group believes they have a solution to the shipping problem – a high speed, specially designed catamaran.The Coastal Villages Region Fund represents 20 villages from Platinum up to Scammon Bay and along the Kuskokwim River.   Pacific Fishing reports that Coastal Villages began advertising last year for a builder for the catamaran, a first of its kind for Alaska. The boat would be used to haul fresh salmon and halibut from the westward fishing grounds directly to Homer, the start of Alaska’s road system. According to specs by vessel manager Kevin Kennedy, the catamaran would be between 130 to 175 feet long and able to carry three 40? standard refrigerated containers on deck, with total cargo capacity of 200,000 pounds.  The vessel would have a range of 900 miles, a speed of 25 knots and be designed to navigate the tight,  shallow ports of Bethel, Dutch Harbor, Homer and others. The price tag for the cargo catamaran would be about $4 million, with the cost split between Coastal Villages and a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.Coastal Villages Region Fund is one of six regional groups in Alaska’s Community Development Quota program, which gets shares of fish and crab harvests from the Bering Sea. The CDQ groups invest money from the catches into local programs and projects for long term gains.   See the specs for the Coastal Villages catamaran at www.highspeedfishtransport.com .<COL>Sea-going superstitions<COL>2007-04-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/04/hatcheries-put-salmon-in-streams/<COL>Hatcheries put salmon in streamsBy Laine WelchDon’t ever refer to it as farming, but homegrown fishes are the Alaska’s largest agricultural crop. Instead, call it ‘ocean ranching.’Whereas farmed fish are grown in closed pens or cages until they’re ready for market, Alaska fish – mostly salmon — are raised in hatcheries until they grow to fingerlings and are released to the sea. The fish feed and grow on the ‘open range’ until they return home to the ‘ranch’ to spawn.Many Alaskans might be surprised that fish from hatcheries make up a huge portion of Alaska’s annual salmon catches.The state oversees operations at 30 privately run hatcheries, which raise a mix of all five Pacific salmon species. Two state-run hatcheries also produce steelhead and rainbow trout, arctic char and grayling for sport anglers. The state also oversees two federal Bureau of Indian affairs hatcheries, as well as several streamside projects throughout Alaska.According to the annual report on Alaska’s salmon enhancement programs, nearly 1.5 billion baby salmon were released to the ocean last year, while 48 million returned to their home hatcheries. Those fish accounted for about 20 percent of Alaska’s total salmon catch last year — and at nearly $59 million, 21 percent of the harvest value.Chums are, by far, the bumper crop for Alaska’s hatcheries, making up 60 percent of fish production. For both pink and coho salmon, it’s 20 percent, with seven percent for kings and 6 percent for sockeye.In some regions, ranched salmon make up most of the common property fishery. At Prince William Sound, for example, fish returning to five hatcheries comprise 73 percent of the annual harvest – 80 percent pinks, 75 percent chums, 49 percent coho and 38 percent sockeye salmon. The combined catches rang in at $19 million, 48 percent of the total PWS value.In Southeast, enhanced salmon accounted for 36 percent of all fish harvested last year, worth $31 million, or 41percent of the total value. In Cook Inlet, 30 percent of the commercial salmon harvest came from local hatcheries, worth $6.5 million, or 44 percent of the harvest value. For Kodiak, the total was seven percent of the salmon catch, worth $2.5 million or 10 percent of the value.More than 61 million salmon are expected to swim home to Alaska hatcheries in 2007 to be caught by local fishermen. Find the fascinating 2006 salmon enhancement report at www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/geninfo/enhance/enhance.php .Salmon sales slipJapan is Alaska’s most important seafood customer, but   salmon exports to that country dropped 46 percent last year.The sales slip is especially strong for fresh/frozen sockeye salmon. According to federal trade figures, sockeye exports to Japan last year were just 13,487 tons, valued at $53 million. That reflects a drop of 62 percent in terms of both volume and value.The shortfall, however, is being made up by sales elsewhere in the world, said KC Dochtermann, international program director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.“We were expecting it, knowing that some of the major producers were starting to turn away from Japan, and redirecting sockeye to the U.S. and Europe, specifically,” Dochtermann said. “Sockeye salmon is probably hotter than anything right now in Europe. Wild is the word, definitely.”Dochtermann said a similar trend has also shifted the market for Alaska pollock.“Traditionally, most of the fish went into Japan’s surimi market, but today, pollock is being used more for fillets. That market is on fire and more pollock is going into the European market, especially Germany,” he said.The “Alaska” brand name is a big selling point, and it sets wild seafood apart from farmed varieties. But Dochtermann cautions that it’s a big world out there and aquaculture is expanding fast.“Gone are the days when Alaska was the 800-pound gorilla of the salmon industry. We’ve gone from being the largest salmon producer on earth to the largest wild-salmon producer on earth,” he said.Most seafood producers believe there is room enough for all, and that Alaska is likely to be best served by developing strong niche markets.“Alaska’s king, sockeye and coho salmon make up just 3.5 percent of the salmon on the planet. That’s the same market share as Mercedes-Benz. We can create that same perception of value,” said fisherman and industry analyst Mark Buckley of Kodiak.ASMI’s Dochtermann agrees. “We’re not trying to get the mass market; we’re trying to skim the cream off the top.”Funds for injured fishermenMany fishermen are unaware that state funds are available to help pay medical bills for injuries or illnesses directly related to commercial fishing. Qualified fishermen can receive up to $2,500 to defray medical costs, and in some cases, much more. The money comes from the Fishermen’s Fund, created in 1951 to provide for the treatment and care of licensed Alaska fishermen.“The fund is supported by 39 percent of the money derived from the sale of commercial fishing licenses, as well as a set fee fishermen pay for permits,” explained Linda Crapo, a spokesperson for the state Dept. of Labor, division of workers’ compensation.“We struggle to let more fishermen know about it. The information is on the back of their licenses, but many miss it. We want them to know there is help available if they are not insured,” Crapo added.Currently, 17,772 resident and 5,088 non-resident Alaska fishermen are contributing to the Fishermen’s Fund. The amount varies from year to year, but it usually amounts to several hundred thousand dollars.Questions? Contact the Fishermen’s Fund at 888-520-2766 or via email at fishfund@labor.state.ak.us.

The statewide catch is projected to come in at 171 million fish, up more than 21 percent from the 2006 season. The fish will go to an expanding mix of global markets that have a growing appreciation for the superior taste and health benefits of wild salmon.Four of the five salmon species harvested in Alaska have showed upward ticks in dockside and wholesale prices in recent years. The one exception is sockeye salmon (reds), which account for up to two-thirds of the total value of the statewide catch.The average price for sockeye last year was 67-cents a pound, down from 73 cents in 2005. Two important trends are driving the sockeye slump, according to industry analyst Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Research & Consulting Group.Most importantly, there has been a dramatic drop in sockeye salmon exports to Alaska’s most important seafood customer, Japan.“Japan has traditionally taken about 75 to 80 percent of Alaska’s H&G (headed and gutted) frozen sockeye pack. For 2006 Japan received 37 percent,” McDowell said. That has made available about 30 million pounds of frozen reds to other markets, primarily the U.S. and Europe.“I think demand is still maturing in those markets and that’s part of what has kept the prices down a bit for sockeye,” he added.Hefty catches have also kept a downward press on the conventional sockeye market. In the past 110 years, the Alaska harvest has topped 40 million fish just 13 times — three of those occurred in the past three years. The catch projection for reds calls for a similar haul this year.“This will be the year when we see to what extent the alternative markets are ready to absorb the additional volume of sockeye at a price that benefits the Alaska industry, “McDowell said.There are likely to be additional volumes of pink salmon for growing markets to absorb as well. Last year Alaska had one of the smallest humpy harvests ever, but forecasters are calling for a bumper catch in 2007. Pink salmon abundance traditionally ebbs and flows on a two year cycle, and 2005 yielded the largest harvest ever topping 160 fish.“Those are the parents of this year’s fish. We’re projecting 108 million pinks but I think we could see a catch exceeding 130 million pinks,” McDowell said.Fewer pinks are ending up in cans, going instead into more valuable frozen products.Three to five years ago, 75 to 80 percent of Alaska’s pink salmon ended up in cans. But a major shift in demand for frozen pinks, especially in China and Europe, has reduced the canned pack to about 50-55 percent, McDowell said.“The oversupply situation for canned pink salmon has ended, and we’ve seen a major price increase as a result. Two years ago the average price for a case of canned pinks (48 talls) was $34. At the end of last year, the case price was up to almost $54. This will be the first time in several years that we haven’t entered the new production season with canned pinks still in inventory,” McDowell said.Interestingly, in some years up to half of the total world supply of wild salmon is pink salmon. For Alaska, pinks usually comprise fully half of the state’s annual harvest.McDowell said coho salmon (silvers) have been the biggest value gainers in recent years.  In the last sales quarter of 2006, average wholesale prices for frozen cohos jumped from $1.90/lb to over $2.70/lb, an increase of 43 percent from the previous year.The market for Alaska chum salmon is also changing. “Sometimes as much as two-thirds of the wholesale value of chums has accrued from the roe. It’s still a major driver, but there is significant interest in frozen chums and fillets,” McDowell said.In 2003 the wholesale price for H&G frozen chums was in the 40 cent range; more recently it has approached $1.00/lb.“Some of the enhanced demand for chums might stem from the shortfall last year in Alaska frozen pinks. We won’t know until July what the trend is,” McDowell added.For chinook salmon (kings), increased catches from West coast fisheries to between 400,000 to 500,000 fish could crimp the record prices Alaska has enjoyed.“That’s double last year, but it’s still only half of the previous five year average. So it’s going to take the edge off some of the unmet demand, but I still think the king markets will be relatively strong this year,” McDowell said.For nearly all salmon species, fillets are the product of choice by most consumers, and that has not been lost on Alaska’s processors. Last year in-state fillet production exceeded 28 million pounds, more than double from three years ago. Of that, more than 15 million pounds were sockeye and coho fillets.Finally, the last two seasons marked the first time in a decade that the dockside value of Alaska’s salmon fishery topped $300 million, and industry watchers predict that trend will continue in 2007.Salmon price watch- Here are the statewide average prices and values for Alaska salmon for 2005 and 2006, with regional highs and lows for 2006:Species    2006    2005    Highs/Lows 2006    Total Value 2006 (millions)Chinook    $2.77    $2.27    PWS: $5.00/Kuskokwim: $.54    $27,137Sockeye    $.67    $.73    PWS: $1.65/Norton Sound: $.45    $160,272Coho    $.99    $.76    Southeast: $1.41/Yukon: $.20    $30,063Pink    $.13    $.12    PWS: $.16/Bristol Bay: $.06    $35,094Chum    $.31    $.27    Southeast: $.35/Kuskokwim: $.05     $56,300Find more salmon price info at http://www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/<COL>Salmon season underway<COL>2007-05-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/04/fish-farms-may-see-new-legislation/<COL>Fish farms may see new legislationOffshore fish farms could be down in the deep within two years if legislation authorizing the new industry gets the go ahead from Congress – and according to industry insiders, it is expected to pass easily.Rep. Nick J. Rahall, D-WV, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, announced last week that, at the request of the Bush administration, he will introduce the National Offshore Aquaculture Act to Congress to help establish the new industry. The legislation would create a regulatory framework for fish and shellfish farming in United States waters from three to 200 miles offshore.The big push toward expanding aquaculture stems primarily from the nation’s $8 billion seafood trade deficit. More than 70 percent of the seafood eaten by Americans is imported from foreign countries. Globally, more than half of all seafood production comes from aquaculture.Legislating the offshore industry flies in the face of Alaska’s federal and state lawmakers. Sen. Murkowski and Gov. Palin have asked for a five-year ban on offshore fish farming to allow time for more environmental and economic studies. Palin also wants a ban on farming certain species like halibut and sablefish, along with subsidies for the fishing industry to compensate for competition from U.S. backed fish farms.But like it or not, the new industry is poised to move forward fast, and Alaska better pay attention.“The world is experiencing an aquaculture revolution. Regardless of whether or not we have interest ourselves, we should be paying very close attention to what’s happening so we can anticipate where our global markets are likely to be in the future,” said Gunnar Knapp, an economist at the University of Alaska Institute of Social and Economic Research.Since the late 1980s Alaska has had a ban on fish farming of any kind. Knapp said he is not advocating rushing into aquaculture, nor does he believe Alaska should shut the door to the possibility of changes in the future.“With any kind of resource development, what are the potential opportunities that we might take advantage of, responsibility and safely?“My feeling is that we should go on more than a gut feeling and a knee jerk reaction of no change from where we are at the moment, to looking at the available evidence with regard to both environmental and market concerns and be sure we’re making the right decision,” he said.“It strikes me as a little incongruous that we would take this attitude of no finfish farming whatsoever under any circumstances, and yet we have a very extensive salmon hatchery program that is of great economic benefit. We’ve made the judgment that any environmental or ecological risks are reasonable and controllable,” he added.Knapp said it is reasonable for Alaska to focus on its wild fisheries and strive to maximize that value.“But does that preclude any involvement in finfish aquaculture?  There’s been a fear in Alaska that fish farming would negatively impact our reputation as the place to get wild seafood. I think it is fair to ask – what is the evidence one way or the other?  Are the values of wild fisheries in Norway and British Columbia reduced because they also are major aquaculture producers? Is there a negative market affect?”Knapp said he finds it interesting that Alaska bristles when others try and dictate what’s best for our state, yet Alaskans are now doing that to others.“It is interesting that Alaska is now telling other states what they should or should not do with aquaculture. I believe in the concept of local control and letting people make their own decisions, both for Alaska and other places,” he said.Copper and fish don’t mixCopper deposited on roads by the wear and tear on vehicle brake pads and exhaust runs off into streams and rivers. Scientists believe that may play a key role in the diminishing salmon stocks throughout California and the Pacific Northwest.Low copper levels can affect the olfactory senses of juvenile coho salmon, according to a new study by Oregon State University and federal scientists.“We were surprised that the brake pads coming from vehicles were a main source of copper,” said Jason Sandahl, co-author of the study which reveals how contaminants can disrupt the chemical balance of aquatic creatures.In this case, low levels of copper at just two parts per billion impaired the small fishes’ sense of smell, which helps them avoid predators. The skin of juvenile salmon is equipped with a special kind of warning system, said Nat Scholz, a researcher at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. When a salmon is attacked by a predator, a chemical cue is released from the skin that signals danger to nearby fish.The researchers found that fish exposed to low levels of copper had an impaired sense of smell and were less responsive to the chemical alarm signal. At higher levels of copper, these predator avoidance behaviors were almost nonexistent.“In the environment, that has some serious implications. If there are predators around and the small fish are not able to respond to these danger signals in the water, they would be the next snack for these larger predators,” Sandahl said.Trace amounts of copper occur naturally in aquatic environments.  But fluctuations due to run-off from storms can increase copper levels in rivers and streams to more than 60 parts per billion in some instances.’In the Northwest, copper from brake pads during the summer can accumulate on the roadsides for several months, and in the fall, when we have our first rain storms, that copper can run into the streams. I believe those short, tense pulses of copper are the most concerning,” Sandahl said.Dissolved copper has been shown to affect the sense of smell in Chinook salmon, rainbow and other trout, minnows and tilapia.The influence of copper on predator-prey interactions is the focus of ongoing research, with the aim of linking fish survival to the productivity of wild salmon populations.  The OSU study appears in the publication Environmental Science and Technology.(Johanna Eurich in Dillingham contributed to this story.)Feedback on Data for deckhandsElectronic landing reports and fish tickets are systems already in place that could be enhanced to collect labor data for deckhands.  That method is the “preferred alternative” by members of the Southwest Alaska Municipal Conference which encompasses communities of the Aleutians East Borough, the Aleutians West Census Area, the Bristol Bay Borough, the Dillingham Census Area, the Kodiak Island Borough and the Lake and Peninsula Borough.Lack of information about one of Alaska’s largest labor sectors is hampering efforts by fisheries-dependent communities to influence public policy making, build infrastructure and grow local economies, according to a report by Northern Economics, Inc.   SWAMC commissioned the report to find ways to improve the collection and reporting of Alaska’s seafood harvesting labor data.“You want to know where the work force is, and what these people are involved in. It’s not just for Southwest communities; it’s a bigger Alaska fishery issue,” said Andy Varner, SWAMC interim director. “We know these workers are part of these boats and participating in these fisheries, but there are serious gaps of information. It’s not documented, so we don’t have the statistics and the data we need.”Currently, the number of crew licenses is counted each year, but those are general to all fisheries. No data show where or how much crew members fished, how much they earned, or if they even fished at all. That lack of data puts fishing dependent communities at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for various grants or relief benefits.Varner said once a path for data collection is chosen, the next step is to identify allies to help keep the project moving forward.“This could take a legislative mandate to make this happen, especially to get some dollars for these agencies to come up with this crew data,” he added.SWAMC is seeking feedback on the data collection ideas from interested stakeholders.

The money can be used to boost fish quality, develop or improve infrastructure, and enhance research and marketing.  The RSDA’s, which were authorized by the Alaska legislature two years ago, can also be used to leverage state and federal grants or other funding opportunities.  “It’s all about control and self direction,” Waldrop said.Bristol Bay sockeye accounts for almost one third of the value of Alaska’s total salmon catch.  Ballots by the driftnet fleet must be postmarked by April 7 — the election results will be tallied by an Anchorage accounting firm and announced by April 30.Bristol Bay is only the second Alaska region to embrace the RSDA concept, following the lead of Prince William Sound/Copper River salmon fishermen. Their first one percent tax assessment yielded about $200,000, which the RSDA used in part for a first time fall Copper River Coho salmon promotion in west and east coast markets in the Lower 48. A vote last year by Southeast Alaska harvesters narrowly rejected an RSDA, which would have represented 61 fisheries under the Rainforest Wild label. Organizers there say they will try again.Another important deadline is drawing close for other fishing regions. As part of its annual meeting cycle, the state Board of Fisheries is calling for proposed changes to fisheries at Cook Inlet, Kodiak and Chignik, as well as for king and Tanner crab fisheries in all regions, except for Southeast and Yakutat. Deadline to submit a proposal is Tuesday, April 10 .On a related note: Governor Palin on Friday announced the appointments of Howard Delo of Big Lake and Vince Webster of King Salmon to the Fish Board. Webster is currently the Lake and Peninsula School District Facilities and Maintenance Director, and for 15 years has served on the Nak-nek/Kvichak Fish and Game Advisory Committee. He fills the seat of Robert Heyano of Bristol Bay.Delo is a retired Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game biologist and fish culturist, and chairs the Mat-Su Valley Fish and Game Advisory Committee. Delo fills the seat of Art Nelson of Anchorage. Both appointees must be approved by the Alaska legislature before they can take their seats at the end of June. The seven-member Fish Board oversees subsistence, personal use, sport and commercial fisheries in state waters.Fish blogAll’s fair in the world of Web logs, or blogs, where people can inform or rant with anonymous postings on any subject. A new blog at the Anchorage Daily News called the Highliner targets one of the state’s most colorful and fractious industries in commercial fishing. It is hosted by Wesley Loy who has been covering the fish beat for the ADN since 1999.“Commercial fishing is regarded as one of the more complicated, tedious beats at the Daily News. I also cover the oil and gas industry, which is really the big money maker in Alaska, but I find it to be a really simple industry compared to the fishing world,” Loy said in a phone interview.Loy, who hails from Tennessee, said it was a fascination with boats that originally lured him to the commercial fishing beat. He said he believes the biggest challenge facing the industry today is aquaculture.“How does Alaska continue to be relevant as a seafood producer when much of the world is engaged in large scale aquaculture — manufacturing fish? And that’s just going to get bigger and bigger, meaning Alaska’s wild capture production will become a smaller piece of the overall pie,” he said.Loy said another major challenge for the industry is the question of fishing rights. “Who will have the right to fish in a given fishery, and what are the costs of segmenting fisheries, whether it be individual quotas or co-ops, or whatever?”On a lighter note — what is Wesley Loy’s favorite fish?  “Canned sockeye. I just turn it over on a plate and eat it right out of the can.”Catch the new fish blog at www.adn.com/highliner.Fish watchThe Bering Sea snow crab fishery is slowly winding down, with about eight million pounds remaining out of the 33 million pound quota. A total of 89 boats signed on for the fishery and about 35 are out on the water now, said ADF&G’s Forrest Bower at Dutch Harbor. The fishery is likely to last through April, he added.Improved market conditions have boosted the base price for Alaska snow crab to about $1.50/lb, compared to 84-cents last season. Sitka Sound’s roe herring fishery is likely to be all over by now. Seiners took most of the nearly 12,000 ton quota in one short opener last Monday. No word on price, but all indications point to a depressed market.Salmon from the gillnet fleet at the Stikine River in Southeast will “officially” mark the start of Alaska’s salmon season on May 7, getting the jump on fish from Copper River. The Stikine catch will be skimpy, however, at just 6,100 king salmon.Fish oil at schoolHealth experts in Britain want fish oil supplements to be required for all school children to improve their intelligence and behavior. According to the Daily Mail, they told Parliament that the nation needs to massively increase its consumption of omega 3 fatty acids found in oily fish. A nutritionist from Oxford University said the supplements are vital to improve the health and intelligence of today’s children and future generations. She added that fish oil also is effective in treating depression and improving mental health.<COL>Bristol Bay has salmon on the brain<COL>2007-04-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/05/fishermen-appalled-at-appeals/<COL>Fishermen appalled at appealsBy Laine WelchAlaska fishermen are taking their message to the streets of San Francisco in hopes of putting an end to more appeals cases by Exxon. It is up to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to decide if Exxon merits another day in court to contest a $2.5 billion punitive damages award ruled in December. The money is compensation for fishermen’s losses stemming from the 1989 oil spill, when a drunken skipper ran the Exxon Valdez tanker aground on a well-marked reef, spilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.A small group called Oiled Fishermen Frustrated by Exxon is paying the expenses for one ‘oiled’ colleague – Arnie King of Cordova – who will carry a picket sign and hand out information about the unresolved case outside the courthouse starting on Monday.  The OFF Exxon group includes about 20 fishermen who have chipped in to cover costs for King’s room and board in San Francisco for about two weeks.“This is the only thing we can think of — to take our message to the street. We’re respectfully asking them to pay attention to this case and move it along,” said Frank Mullen, an OFF Exxon spokesman from Homer.“Our hope is that we can get a message especially to Chief Justice Mary Schroeder that says please understand there are 35,000 fishermen out there who are waiting for resolution on this litigation. And if the judges could work for a couple extra hours on a Saturday to clear out this latest appeal that would be great.”Exxon’s strategy of endless appeals has bounced the case back and forth between federal and State courts for more than 10 years. The oil giant has stated it will appeal the $2.5 settlement all the way to the Supreme Court.“They are simply so big, they do not care,” said Matt Jamin, an attorney for hundreds of Kodiak fishermen. “Some of their lawyers have told us they are a bit embarrassed by it, but they say they are being well paid to implement a strategy which is to crush litigation from any place at any time. Any size, big, small whatever – they will take whatever resources they need to fight it to the end, and we are seeing that in this case.”Meanwhile, nearly 20 percent of the original claimants have passed away while waiting for resolution from Exxon.“It’s been 18 years and we don’t want even more fishermen to die before they see an end to this litigation. Justice delayed is justice denied and oiled fishermen simply want the court to get on with the case,” Mullen said.Jamin and other attorneys speculate that the 9th Circuit and/or the Supreme Court are unlikely to hear Exxon’s appeals. Depending on further motions in court, a final decision on the settlement is possible by the end of this year or by mid-2008.Get tax protection!Another measure that needs to get moving is a bill that will protect Alaska fishermen from huge tax hits when Exxon is ordered to settle the punitive damages lawsuit. Protections will come from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Tax Treatment Act – if it is passed by U.S. senators.“We need to get this bill (S.552) heard and moved along so it can pass this year. If it isn’t passed, fishermen will lose up to 35 percent or more of their Exxon settlement,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska.The Act provides for one time retirement contributions and income averaging of Exxon settlements. It is not a tax break for Alaska, Vinsel stressed.“It is more of a tax treatment to defer these taxes. Ultimately, they will still be paid fairly when they’re taken out of retirement accounts,” he explained.It is also important that people living in other states tell their senators they are Alaska fishermen.“We’ve got fishermen from every state of the country. Washington, Oregon, Montana and Colorado are among the top ten states where Alaska fishermen come from. Key seats on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee are held by representatives from those states, and it is up to them to act on the bill. If they are not hearing from their own constituents, they have no reason to want to move it,” Vinsel said.UFA is urging fishermen to fax letters or make phone calls to reps on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee asking them to support S. 552, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Tax Treatment Act. Contact UFA in Juneau for more information.Salmon up close at SewardFollow salmon from egg hatch to their return home at a gigantic new exhibit opening next week at the Alaska Sea Life Center in Seward. It’s unlike anything done before anywhere in the world, said Steve Carrick, manager of visitor operations.“We’ve created an ‘ant farm’ type approach to looking at a salmon nest, so you actually see a cross section of a stream bed and the eggs under the gravel.  They’ll hatch and the young fish will then populate our fresh water streams, move to another giant tank mimicking an estuary habitat, then on to an even larger tank simulating the abyssal void of the ocean. It’s all designed   so you’re at eye level, standing above and below the water. We call it total immersion,” Carrick said.The half million dollar project was funded by the Southeast Sustainable Salmon Fund specifically to create an educational exhibit at the Sea Life Center.“We realized there was a glaring omission at the Center on where salmon come from, how they breed, and why and how they find their way back to their natal streams. This really connects visitors with the heart of Alaska’s fishing industry,” he added.The salmon exhibit will eventually provide a unique peek into the natural world of more than 300 of all five species of Alaska salmon.“It’s like the widest of wide screen television looking into the life of salmon. It really is spectacular,” Carrick said.The salmon exhibit opens May 25th at the Alaska Sea Life Center in Seward.

Bill Thomas of Haines, a lifelong commercial fisherman, would require contracts that outline how and when crewmembers will be paid. The written agreements would mirror a federal law that applies to vessels of 20 gross tons or more. Thomas’ proposal would apply to all state fishing boats, even those with just one deckhand.Many Alaska skippers routinely provide contracts for their crew, but most do not. And many agreements are ambiguous and open for wide interpretation.”This would professionalize the relationship by putting a statute into Alaska law,” said Thomas’ fisheries aide Ian Fisk. “It would require contracts that outline how and when crewmembers will be paid. We’re not trying to tell skippers what expenses are allowable, because that’s up to them to determine. But the crewman needs to know what expenses are going to be deducted from the gross proceeds to arrive at the adjusted gross upon which his or her percentage will be paid.”Fisk, also a fisherman, said the contracts would be “very basic” and could be “tweaked” to accommodate variances in different fisheries.“We’re not trying to limit the skipper’s discretion in terms of how he or she wants to write a contract — as long as the crew agrees and knows up front what the arrangement is,” he said.Penalties for non-compliance are still being defined, but not having copies of crew contracts on board would likely result in a fine or ticket.Several deckhands said requiring a clearly defined crew contract is a good idea.“When salmon season was over, my skipper told me that I wouldn’t get my full share if I didn’t haul and chop firewood for his home use, and also paint his fence,” said a Kodiak deckhand, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He made similar threats about my sticking around ‘just in case’ he wanted to make a few quick trips into the fall.”Several deckhands on a Kodiak halibut boat also lamented long lags before getting paid, with no explanations by their skippers. Similarly, Fisksaid he and Rep. Thomas decided to take action after two Juneau crewmen complained they had each been shorted $10,000 by a skipper.Fisk said time might not allow for the crew contract bill to be heard during the legislative session that is set to end on May 16. He said a draft will be circulated to fishing groups for public comment during the year and the measure will be taken up by Alaska lawmakers in 2008.‘We want this to be a requirement, similar to having car insurance. It would be a law that is enforced and has some teeth to it,” Fisk said. “Fishing is a profession and whether a deckhand is working for a summer or the rest of his life, it’s only fair to know how and what you’re being paid. By having a contract signed by both parties, we hope to reduce the amount of disputes that end up in court.”Fish czarinaCora Crome of Petersburg will cover Alaska’s statewide fish policy beat as the newest member of Gov. Sarah Palin’s staff, a position dubbed ‘fish czar’ by previous administrations.”Fisheries Coordinator is what we’re calling it,” said Deputy Chief of Staff Mike Nizich in a phone interview. “Gov. Palin made a decision not to have what you would refer to as a ‘fish czar’ because we’ve heard that in other settings and she didn’t want to go that route.Crome’s resume reads like a who’s who in statewide fisheries groups and policy committees. Most recently she was director of the Petersburg Vessel Owners Association and she currently serves on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council’s Advisory Panel.Nizich said Crome will work closely with a recharged ‘fish cabinet’, a loosely gathered group that rarely made it onto the radar screen in the Murkowski Administration.“She’s going to be a coordinator of a sub-cabinet of selected members, more than likely for the Departments of Commerce, Fish and Game, Labor, Law and our Washington D.C. offices on federal fishery issues. They will recommend state fisheries, and our fish coordinator will basically be the one doing the leg work and the staffing for that body,” Nizich said.Nizich has been the interim point person for fish issues in the Governor’s office for the past five months, and said he is happy to pass the baton to Crome.“It is very labor intensive. We get a tremendous amount of interest in fisheries statewide — every gear type, every issue…you name it, from sport to commercial, from groundfish to net fisheries. People call in and want to be able to talk to somebody on the governor’s staff right here on the 3rd floor,” he said.Crome will be on the job in Juneau starting May 9. She declined comment until Gov. Palin makes the official announcement.Salmon fishing beginsAlthough trollers in Southeast have been landing fresh kings all winter, Alaska’s 2007 salmon season ‘officially’ kicks off May 7 with trollers and gillnetters targeting kings on the Stikine River near Wrangell.May 14 will see the start of Alaska’s most famous salmon fishery at Copper River, where fishery managers are preparing for another good season for the region’s more than 500 permit holders. Steve Moffitt in Cordova says it’s hoped this year’s fishery will meet or beat last year’s harvest“Last year was a really good fishery — better than the preseason forecast, and I’m hoping this year’s fishery will also be better,” said Steve Moffitt at the AK Dept. of Fish and Game office in Cordova.A catch of just over one million Copper River sockeye salmon is projected for this season, down just slightly from nearly 1.5 million fish last year, the 5th largest catch in 116 years. The king salmon harvest is pegged at 44,000, up from 30,000 last summer.Moffitt said cold weather could get things off to a slow start.“Generally when you have cold ocean temperatures the fish tend to arrive a little later than normal. So May 14 may be a little slow on the front end of the early arrivals,” he said.Starting prices last year for Copper River salmon set records at about $3.75 a pound at the docks for sockeyes and over $6 a pound for kings. The average prices for the season settled out at $5.00/lb for kings and $1.65 for reds.Meanwhile, Moffitt said there is a lot of excitement in Cordova as the famous fishery gears up for the 2007 season.“Anticipation is really building. Everyone wants to have some fresh fish and get out there and get the season started.”The 2007 Alaska salmon season is projected to yield a statewide catch of 171 million fish, an increase of more than 20 percent from last year.<COL>Law could improve deckhand contracts<COL>2007-05-09<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/08/alaska-seafood-cook-off-favorite/<COL>Alaska seafood cook off favoriteThe Great American Seafood Cook Off is designed to feature local specialties from across the nation, but Alaska seafood is a favorite in every state. That was the response of the 20 chefs who competed at last week’s event in New Orleans.The chefs and their assistants gathered on a huge stage last Sunday under the glare of Food Network lights at the downtown convention center as part of the Louisiana Foodservice Expo, the annual trade show for the restaurant industry. It marked the third year for the Cook Off, which is the brainchild of our nation’s top federal fisheries manager, Bill Hogarth, as a way to draw attention to domestic fisheries. “It’s our job to manage fisheries in a way that ensures that you have enough to eat,” Hogarth said in his introductory remarks.The 2006 event was also a way to lure people back to “The Big Easy” as it slowly rebuilds itself after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. While the downtown region has recovered, all of the local neighborhoods remain as ruined, rubble covered and abandoned as they did after the hurricane hit one year ago.”This means so much to our state and New Orleans and our fishing industry, as well as to all the fishermen around the country,” said Ewell Smith, event producer and director of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board, his voice choked with emotion.Alaska’s Naomi Everett of Settlers Bay Lodge at Wasilla bested four other top chefs in a state cook off to represent Alaska at the national event.  “I am so excited to be here. I feel very blessed and nervous. The competition is awesome,” she said as she anxiously prepared her Alaska salmon, halibut and king crab roulade entry. “Everyone is kind of amazed that I’m here from so far away…they regard Alaska as kind of a special state. The other chefs love talking about Alaska seafood, but they’re not really very knowledgeable about it. Everyone mentions our 300-pound halibut,” she added.And halibut is clearly a favorite among American chefs. “Halibut is our No. 1 selling dish. Every ticket has two orders on it and we sell at least 40 pounds a night,” said Chef Shawn Wellersdick of Port Land Grille in North Carolina.“We use halibut three different ways at our Ocean Restaurant, and your fresh king salmon is the best. You guys have a great state up there with some great seafood,” said Troy Guard of Colorado.Alaska halibut and salmon is featured on the menu in many restaurants in Kentucky, said chef Jay Denham (Park Place on Main & Browing’s Restaurant and Brewery). Salmon is a big seller in Missouri, said chef Tim Grandinetti of Renaissance Grand, who added that more diners are definitely aware of the difference between “wild and farmed.””We serve tons of Alaska seafood,” said chef John Nye of King’s Fish House in California. “We have a wild salmon promo going on right now.”Ditto, said chef Tim Thomas of Georgia’s Ocean Forest Club.  Texas chef Larry Perdido of Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill said he serves Alaska halibut and added, “I would love to go there and catch a big lingcod.”Maryland chef Tim Recher (Wyndham Baltimore Inner Harbor Hotel) called Alaska halibut and wild salmon “amazing” and said he also loves Alaska king crab.Chef Brian Flagg of Jasper White’s Summer Shack in Massachusetts sources Alaska seafood only when he needs to supplement local species, and orders halibut, salmon and sablefish.“The freshest things are those coming from your local waters or soils. An event like this that uses local domestic seafoods gets us all invigorated,” he said.Of course, Washington chef Carrie Carlsteen of ZinZanni was a big fan of Alaska seafood.“My menu tries to feature white king salmon. I can’t believe how delicious it is. We also use salmon and cod.”Alaska seafood is also a regular with Oregon chef Pascal Sauton, who held a fundraiser at his Carafe Restaurant to benefit New Orleans fishermen. It raised $2,000 and was matched by the Oregon Seafood Commission. “It’s our way of saying thank you to them for being so welcoming and to help the local fishing industry,” Sauton said.Fittingly, New Orleans chef Frank Brigtsen of Brigtsen’s Restaurant offered a Rebuilt Louisiana Seafood Platter as his entry, adding that“Alaska is my second favorite state. When fish is tight, I fly in halibut and salmon. I love it and will take all I can get. So many Americans have gotten used to farmed salmon and forget what wild tastes like.”When all was said and done, Florida’s Justin Timineri was crowned America’s Seafood King for his crispy pan-seared yellow tail snapper with passion fruit cream and citrus salmon, garnished with shrimp and green mango jam.“I’m about to jump out of my skin,” he said at being crowned the winner.Timineri has the unique position of executive chef for the Florida State Dept. of Agriculture.“No other state has an official chef. It’s my job to promote Florida commodities. We need to stay away from imported stuff and can look no further than our own coastlines,” Timineri said.His Team Florida partner and assistant for the cook off competition was Joshua Butler, Governor Jeb Bush’s chef.Sponsors of the 2006 Cook Off included NOAA Fisheries, Shell Oil, Budweiser, Tabasco, Seafood Business and Wild Catch Magazines.<COL>Alaska seafood cook off favorite<COL>2006-08-16<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/08/americans-like-frozen-fish/<COL>Americans like frozen fishFrozen seafoods are becoming a popular favorite for America’s health conscious, time-crunched families. According to the market research publication Packaged Facts, nearly half of the nation’s 110 million households now eat frozen fish and shellfish, and frozen fish has become the fastest growing industry sector since 2000.“It’s exciting,” said Ray Riutta, director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. “There was a stigma a few years ago that seafood had to be fresh. We’ve done a good job of changing that perception.”ASMI has seen steady sales growth in its national Cook It Frozen campaign, which for three years has targeted customers directly at retail stores. Riutta is quick to credit U.S. chefs for building consumer confidence in frozen fish. “Nearly 60 percent of Americans eat seafood at restaurants. When they see top notch chefs using frozen Alaska seafood, they’re setting a standard that everyone is emulating. And that’s translating into acceptance of frozen seafood,” Riutta said.It’s also translating into huge transportation savings for Alaska. “Sending fish out frozen equates to pennies or nickels per pound in transportation costs instead of dimes and quarters for fresh,” said market analyst Chris McDowell. It also reduces risk in terms of shelf life. “That is a really important value component among big buyers,” McDowell added.Packaged Facts said sales of frozen seafood increased nearly 11 percent at U.S. food outlets through May 2006.  Sales totaled nearly $28 billion in 2005; the market is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2010.On a related note: Intrafish reports that France’s #1 salmon importer, Direct Ocean, sold record volumes of frozen Alaska salmon this year as consumers turned away from higher priced farmed fish. The company imported 1,000 metric tons of Alaska salmon (about 2.2 million pounds), or two and a half times more than usual.Council wannabes – Eleven contenders are now vying for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council seat recently vacated by Arne Fuglvog of Petersburg. The NPFMC oversees fisheries in federal waters, meaning from three to 200 miles offshsore. Fuglvog, the only active fishermen on the federal advisory panel, left this month to join Senator Lisa Murkowski’s staff in Washington D.C.The state Office of Boards and Commissions lists council hopefuls as: Joe Childers of Juneau, director of  the group Western Gulf of Alaska Fishermen; Duncan Fields is a Kodiak fisherman, attorney and natural resources consultant; John Moller of Juneau is  a fisherman and manager of the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association. (Those three also currently serve on the Council’s advisory panel).Also on the list – Ben Ellis, director of the Anchorage-based Institute of the North, which studies Arctic lands, seas and resources; Peter Garay of Homer is president of the group Alaska Marine Pilots; Robert Loescher of Juneau is former president and CEO of Sealaska Corp. Walter Sargent of Kodiak is a longtime commercial fisherman; Jeff Stephen is director of the Kodiak-based United Fishermen’s Marketing Association; Bruce Tiedeman is a former Prince William Sound fisherman, former director of the Chugach Native Corp., and now manages community relations for the Alaska Energy Authority;  Sandra Moller is president and CEO of the Anchorage-based Aleut Enterprise Corp.The front runner is widely rumored to be longtime fisherman Gerry Merrigan of Petersburg, who is the government affairs officer for Prowler Fisheries. Governor Murkowski will forward three names to the Secretary of Commerce who will approve the final selection. The governor said the NPFMC seat will be filled prior to the October meeting in Dutch Harbor.Snow crab gets good report -  State managers recently announced a 4.6 percent cut right off the top of the 2006 Bristol Bay red king crab quota due to high levels of highgrading last season. Highgrading is the practice of sorting out only the best of the catch in order to get higher prices and putting the rest back in the water. In the case of king crab, they were sorted according to the appearance of their shells.But highgrading was not a common practice in the larger Bering Sea snow crab fishery, said state director of commercial fisheries Denby Lloyd. “It doesn’t appear that it happened. It might be due to not having the same incentives for sorting, or there may not be the market differentiation for shell condition, or the volumes were different,” he said.Red king crab goes into more high end markets, especially in Japan, where its size and appearance are the most important selling points. Snow crab, on the other hand, goes primarily to less discriminating family style restaurants or buffets, mostly in the U.S. It is a far more differentiated market that accepts clusters of snow crab legs in widely varying sizes.The Alaska crab industry hopes to soon find ways to broaden the market for king crab, perhaps into picked meat products. Meanwhile, market reports indicate the outlook for Alaska snow crab is strengthening, due to short supply of popular five to eight ounce leg clusters. (Snow crab is traditionally sold in 20 pound boxes.) Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley said for much of the summer 5-8s were wholesaling in Boston at $3.15-$3.25/lb. Now they are at $3.35-$3.50/lb. Other sizes were ‘holding" – 3 – 5 ounce clusters were at $2.60-$2.70/lb, 8 ups at $3.35-$3.55 and 10 ups at $3.60-$3.65/lb.<COL>Americans like frozen fish<COL>2006-08-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/05/something%e2%80%99s-fishy-and-it%e2%80%99s-not-the-fish/<COL>Something’s fishy and it’s not the fishBy Laine WelchContaminants and chemicals…antibiotics and additives…growth hormones and genetic modifications – if “you are what you eat,” headlines connecting these phrases with foods have people more concerned than ever about what they are putting into their mouths.A recent study by the Food Marketing Institute, (FMI), tried to quantify the impact that food scares are having on purchasing habits. The FMI survey found that consumers who were “completely” or “somewhat confident” in the safety of supermarket foods declined to 66 percent, down from 82 percent in 2006. That same year, 38 percent of Americans stopped purchasing a particular food in response to food safety concerns, compared to just nine percent in 2005.Most recently, adulterated feeds imported from China have sickened and killed many pets. Feeds with the same ingredients have been widely fed to pigs, poultry and fish.Is there any way to guarantee that what we are eating is safe?Knowing where foods come from is a good place to start.  A simple, affordable Web-based system called ScoringAg can trace any product’s origin and journey in just seconds, assuring it comes from reputable suppliers.“We can pinpoint ingredients, fish, crops, animals, containers, fowl — anything that might need to be traced, including machinery,” said William Kanitz, co-creator of the one-of-a-kind system that reduces record-keeping to simply hitting a button and filling in data fields.“ScoringAg can do a ‘trace up’ of who received the product, or a ‘trace back’ to where it originated, all within a few seconds,” Kanitz said from his office in Sarasota, Fla.  “The system operates ‘at the speed of commerce,’ whether you’re at the packing plant or on the farm or a fisherman out on the ocean.”Kanitz said his company is creating a program for Alaska Quality Seafoods that tracks fish from deck to dinner plate using text messages via cell phone.The ScoringAg system, which meets U.S. labeling law requirements, is affordable to the world’s poorest producers. The cost depends on how often it’s used.“The system is based upon the cost of reuse. It’s very individualized and the more you use it, the cheaper it gets. The initial cost is $10, and 55-cents per record or location,” Kanitz said.He added that ScoringAg is one simple tool that can help reassure customers that their food is safe.“If I want to purchase something, I usually ask a few questions about it – is this stuff fresh and where did it come from,” he said. “And that’s what our system answers, all at the speed of Google.”Get more information at www.scoringag.com.Seafood trends and hot topics – Nothing provides a better idea of what Americans are eating than the items on menus at U.S. restaurants. Seafood remains a big seller, according to reports this week from the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago. Now in its 88th year, the show featured 2,200 exhibitors and attracted more than 70,000 people.Intrafish reports that buyers are looking for new fish species, but salmon remains a top item. Interestingly, “people are asking for wild but buying farmed,” said Peter Cannon of Seattle-based Cannon Fish Company. He said wild salmon are more difficult to cook because they lose moisture more quickly than farmed fish. Cannon predicts wild salmon will need to be injected with more moisture in order to compete with farmed varieties.New seafood appetizers, such as scallop poppers and king crab stuffers, were a big hit at the show. To cash in on the convenience craze, companies introduced cook-in-the-bag king crab legs and king crab in eight ounce tubs.Single portions of seafood marinated before freezing were introduced by Chilean producers. Phillips Foods had a hit with its new ‘high tech’ covering sheet that is coated with seasonings, and touted as a time saving, fool proof way to cook fish.Intrafish said sustainability remained a big buzzword at the restaurant show, and recycled packaging was a hot topic. Contaminants and the use of chemicals and antibiotics were also big concerns among seafood buyers. Along that line, California-based Wild Planet lintroduced  a line of  pouched, sustainable, ‘minimal’ mercury albacore tuna loins that drew lots of interest from food service buyers, especially from colleges and universities.B.C. fish farm flap – Fish farmers at neighboring British Columbia are reeling from a decision by lawmakers that calls for a radical revamp of their industry.A legislative committee released a report last week recommending that within five years fish farmers should convert their open net pens to some sort of floating closed containment systems. The closed systems, – which don’t even exist yet, would prevent  farmed fish from escaping, reduce pollution from fish wastes, cut down the spread of diseases and sea lice, and prevent sea lions and seals from becoming entangled in net pens.The 10-member committee also called for a ban on salmon farms along the province’s coast nearest Alaska.Fish farmers responded that if the government mandates the closed systems, it will sink salmon farming in B.C. The province currently has about 130 salmon farms, mostly located along the east coast of Vancouver Island. The industry reportedly generates $440 million a year and employs more than 6,000 workers.  The measure will come to a vote before the entire B.C. Legislature this fall.Wild taste tweaks — In other farmed fish news — a company called HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries has developed a process that gives farmed tilapia the ‘taste, texture and aroma of wild fish.’ The company, which is based in British Columbia with an office in Seattle, operates in China, the world’s largest tilapia producer. HQ president Norbert Sporns said the new product responds to demand for farmed products that better imitate ‘sea flavor.’The product is being produced in frozen blocks and fillets, and has reportedly been met with enthusiasm by industry leaders anxious to supplement dwindling ocean production of wild caught fish.The United States is the biggest importer of the popular whitefish, and sales to the United States alone are growing at more than 30 percent a year. The American Tilapia Association projects worldwide sales will top $4 billion by 2010. Sporns said HQ aims to become the global leader in what he calls “zero toxin aquaculture.”<COL>Something’s fishy and it’s not the fish<COL>2007-05-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/09/crackdown-in-crab-industry/<COL>Crackdown in crab industryby Laine WelchAlaska’s Bering Sea crab industry is fed up with being pinched by Russian poachers who are flooding U.S. markets with illegally caught king crab from the Barents Sea. Industry leaders are joining international efforts to crackdown on the illegal fishing, and also are asking for help from Congress.The Barents Sea, which straddles Norway and Russia, is home to the world’s biggest new crab boom. Both countries have been conducting a legal fishery there for less than five years. King crab was transplanted to the Barents Sea by Russians about 60 years ago. Today, the largely untapped resource is estimated at 12 million legal size king crabs and it is growing fast.The Norwegian share of the king crab quota last year was 240,000 crabs (about two million pounds); the Russian quota was three million animals (22 million pounds). While there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Norwegian crabbers, fisheries officials estimate the Russian poaching rate topped 44 million pounds of king crab in the past year – two times the legal catch quota. A similar illegal catch is also projected for 2007 and 2008.Most of the poundage is ending up in the U.S., according to Arni Thomson, director of the Alaska Crab Coalition (ACC), a Seattle-based trade group that is leading the charge to curtail the crab influx. Thomson discussed the problem last month with fisheries and marketing officials in Norway, and took his findings to the U.S. Congress.“It is clear that almost 30 million pounds of processed crab would not be available on the world market, were it not for illegal fishing in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea. We believe the bulk of that comes into the U.S.,” Thomson said. Based on current prices, the illegal king crab has an estimated wholesale value of $225-$250 million.There is no doubt that the illegal tonnage is displacing markets and driving down prices for Alaska’s crab industry, said market analyst John Sackton. “It is a serious problem. The U.S. king crab supply has increased by about 60 percent due to the Barents Sea production. As a result, market prices could be 15 to 25 percent lower for the Bering Sea industry this year,” Sackton predicted.To make matters worse, the Russian crab is widely marketed as “Alaska king crab,” Thomson said. Unfortunately, no protection is provided to U.S. consumers under the new Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) laws. As with Alaska canned salmon, crab is categorized as “processed” and is therefore exempt from the labeling requirement.The Alaska Crab Coalition is urging U.S. lawmakers to get tough with the king crab poachers and put an end to the illegal operations. Importation of illegally harvested Russian crab is prohibited under the Lacey Act and violators face stiff penalties. Mislabeling the crab also may violate laws that apply to deceptive marketing practices. The Bering Sea industry also is supporting plans by Norwegian and other European authorities to have all fish products go through customs clearance at approved ports, instead of being exported directly from the fishing grounds. The Coalition also is recommending mandatory satellite tracking on Russian crab vessels, and development of a system of traceability of landings.“We need to take these steps if we are to pull ourselves out of the quagmire of depressed prices,” the ACC’s Thomson said.In general, illegal fishing has always existed but the practice has grown alarmingly in recent decades. Kofi Annan, General Secretary of the United Nations, said at a recent world summit:  “The increase in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing can be seen as one of the most serious problems endangering world fisheries.” The U.N. estimates the global value of illegally harvested fish at between $4 -$9 billion annually.Copper River coho promo – Copper River fishermen have expanded the offerings of their famous fish to include coho (silver) salmon. Fresh silvers are on their way now to eager retail partners in Seattle and Boston, where a snappy radio ad (produced by Jack Frost of Anchorage) plugs the arrival of “the last great salmon of the season.”The coho promotion is the first effort by the fishermen-controlled Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association, which is funded by a one percent tax on their salmon catches. Marketing coordinator Beth Poole said the coho promo “keeps the Copper River name out there longer, and that coho is a great introductory and more affordable fish.”Poole added that the Association is in the midst of developing a more comprehensive plan for all salmon in the region “to benefit our fishermen, processors and our local communities.”Coho raise cancer funds As another example of how the Copper River fishing community works together – coho fishermen are donating a penny a pound all season as a fundraiser for Rick Johnson on the F/V Polar Star to help pay the bills for his cancer treatments. Copper River Seafoods is donating one penny for every pound of silvers it buys, and will match all similar donations made by salmon harvesters.<COL>Crackdown in crab industry<COL>2006-09-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/09/steller-sea-lions-center-stage/<COL>Steller sea lions center stageHow much do Americans living in say, Iowa, care about endangered populations of Steller sea lions in Alaska – and how much would they be willing to pay, perhaps in higher taxes, to protect them?  A survey by federal fisheries economists aims to find out, and it could be used to help shape future protective measures for the marine mammals.A notice last month in the Federal Register advised that a random survey of 2,400 Americans would be used to measure preferences toward protecting sea lions in Alaska. It read: “Since different options are available, it is important to understand the public’s attitudes about possible impacts on the sea lions, Alaska’s fisheries, communities and the nation….This information is not currently available, yet it is crucial to ensure the efficient management of sea lions and Alaskan fisheries.”Say what?! The thought that opinions by far away folks might drive fishery management policies had Alaska’s industry quaking in its Xtra-Tuffs. A patchwork of sea lion protective measures imposed several years ago has shuffled fishing grounds and seasons, and continues to cause economic hardship on fishermen and communities.Not to worry, said economists at the Seattle-based Alaska Fisheries Science Center, who hastened to add that a clarification will be made to the Federal Register notice due to “confusion of the purpose and scope of the project.”“We are not trying to evaluate how the public feels about particular management options and protection scenarios. The project is focused on different rebuilding and recovery outcomes for Steller sea lions and how they would feel about those outcomes … how they value those outcomes,” explained economist Rob Felthoven.“For example, is it more important to people that we achieve a certain increase in the population size versus a certain endangered species listing status? We want to understand the types of trade offs people might make,” said economist Dan Lew.“It’s a branch of economics that tries to understand nonmarket values that people place on things they don’t go out and buy,” added division director Pat Livingston.A number of previous economic studies have tried to value threatened and endangered species on land, but very few have been done on marine mammals. The most recent survey in 2001 revealed that a random sample of 297 Florida households would donate an average of $10.25 to a fund to protect endangered manatees if government protection was removed.An earlier survey asked California households how much they would be willing to pay into a special protection fund to increase gray whale populations by 50 percent and 100 percent. (The responses averaged $16.18 and $18.14 per year, respectively, in 1992 dollars). Another questionnaire asked Californians to estimate their willingness to pay for a protection fund to preserve existing populations of bottlenose dolphins, sea otters, elephant seals, gray whales and blue whales. The average values ranged from a low of $21.69 for elephant seals to a high of $28.78 for blue whales (in 1984 dollars).“Federal agencies have a mandate that requires we consider the costs and benefits associated with regulatory actions,” Felthoven said. “Since we don’t know the values people place on Steller sea lion protections, the nationwide survey will help fill a gap that meets a regulatory requirement and provide better information that decision makers can use in evaluation the trade offs  between different goals of these programs.”The public is also invited to comment on whether the collection of the Steller sea lion survey information.  Deadline to comment to NOAA Fisheries is October 16.Fishing futures – Coastal communities face an uncertain future as fisheries are rationalized, privatized and restructured.  A two-day conference this month will offer strategies to make sure fishing remains as a vibrant sector throughout Alaska.“The idea is to be forward looking, to think about the planning we need to do now so our next generations will have fishing as an economic opportunity,” said Paula Cullenberg, a marine advisory agent with Alaska Sea Grant, a sponsor of the event.Cullenberg added the conference is not academic or political, and is designed to appeal to any coastal community residents.“Everyone recognizes the answers are not the same in Petersburg or Bethel or Koliganik. Every community is different and in a lot of ways we’re isolated from each other. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit with people from other parts of the state or the country or the world and share ideas that spark creativity and you can take them back to your community,” she said.“We must not ignore or suck the economic vitality from small coastal communities when we embrace the goals of more efficiency in fisheries management,” said Phil Smith, director of the federal Restricted Access Management division in Juneau.Speakers include John Kearney of Nova Scotia, Chandrika Sharma of the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers in Chennai, India, and Stephanie Madsen, chair of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.The Harvesting the Future conference takes place Sept. 21-22 at the Anchorage Hilton.

A vote in the House of Representatives would have strengthened many aspects of the bill by expanding the role of science in fishery management and adding measures to protect fish stocks.  Many hail the House bill (HR 5018) as being modeled after Alaska’s management successes.A disappointed Dave Benton, director of the Marine Conservation Alliance, urged Congress to get back to work on the bill in November by saying:  “Otherwise the country will miss a unique opportunity to conserve our ocean resource, and preserve the health of our nation’s fisheries and fishing communities.”<COL>Steller sea lions center stage<COL>2006-09-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/09/fish-its-whats-for-lunch/<COL>Fish … It’s what’s for lunchLaine WelchRob George has had a long love affair with king crab and he is sharing it in an unconventional way. George is co-owner of the Anchorage-based Crab Broker, Inc. which sells all kinds of crab from around the world. But his specialty is fresh-cooked Alaska king crab.“It’s my baby,” he said, adding that he was the first to begin brokering fresh-cooked king crab clusters out of Dutch Harbor 14 years ago. George wanted to create a closer working relationship with his customers, and to help them understand the complexities of getting Alaska king crab to their restaurants or retail counters. “I wanted to take them from boat to box – to show them all the different hoops we have to jump through to get the crab from the source to them in a timely manner,” he explained.What better way than to take them to the source? In July, George and his partner Eric Donaldson brought 42 buyers and chefs to Nome to participate in the Norton Sound king crab fishery.“I was blown away by the ability to get seafood from that remote of a location. We get crab from all over the world, but the quality that comes out of Norton Sound is awesome. To take the crab from a small boat, into the cooking pot and to our restaurant the next day is amazing,” said Dwight Colton, vice president of the upscale Fish Market Restaurants, an upscale chain of nine outlets in California and Arizona. The company also owns its own wholesale seafood supply company, Farallon Fisheries. “We think of ourselves as seafood people in the restaurant business versus restaurant people that sell seafood,” Colton added.As a first-time visitor to Alaska, Colton said his first impression was the open friendliness of the people in Nome. “They opened their homes, offered us rides…that just doesn’t happen in large metropolitan areas of California. People in Nome were always waving at me and it wasn’t with their middle finger,” he said with a laugh.In Nome, the visit turned into a community event.  The group netted salmon from the Pilgrim River and cooked it on willow branches on the beach. They also held an auction with items from the visitors’ restaurants and stores and raised more than $2,000 for a local women’s shelter.The Crab Brokers are now busily organizing a tour to Dutch Harbor in late October, where buyers and chefs can again see “the real deal” as boats offload red king crab from the Bristol Bay fishery.“We’ve got it line up so the group will actually go out on a big vessel and drop gear about six miles out of Dutch Harbor so they can see how it’s done,” said Rob George. “We’re also hoping to get the ok from fishery managers to pull a pot that’s loaded with king crab,” he added.George said the tours allow his company to meet with their clients, and it’s the best way for them to gain a real appreciation of Alaska’s seafood and its fisheries. The Fish Market’s Dwight Colton had glowing words for Alaska seafood in general.“My visit solidified what we already know about Alaska seafood. You can say hand over your heart that Alaska has superior seafood than any other state.“The supplies of high quality seafood we get out of Alaska are unrivaled  year in and year out. There is a lot of competition among states and  I think Alaska has done a better job of marketing its seafood than anybody else,” Colton said.Colton, who has already booked his ticket for the Dutch Harbor trip, said he is really excited to be going to the source of the “Deadliest Catch,” one of cable TV’s most popular television shows.“If I get even half as much out of the Dutch Harbor trip as I did from Nome, I’ll be thrilled,” he said.You can follow along with Colton’s Alaska king crab adventure at www.thefishmarket.com .Seafood prices top other proteins – According to price index reports, consumer food prices topped four percent over the past year, while wholesale prices lodged nearly a nine percent increase.  And seafood is outpacing its other center of the plate competitors in terms of price increases at both the wholesale and retail levels. Market analyst Ken Talley of Seafood Trends reports that retail seafood prices jumped a modest 4.5 percent over the past year, while wholesale seafood costs notched a hefty nine percent gain. Fresh seafood led the way with a 6.2 increase in prices, while frozen fish and shellfish prices gained only 2.1 percent.But the jump in prices has a downside when compared to competing proteins, and it could be reflected when people reach for their wallets. Beef prices, for example, have dropped by about one percent, poultry prices are down by almost three percent and pork has registered a gain of less than one percent. Talley said the Bureau of Labor reports strong increases in seafood trade overall, especially for imports.On a related note: The latest report by the international Food and Agriculutre Organization (FAO) said in 1980, just nine percent of the fish consumed in the world came from aquaculture. Today that number has jumped to  43 percent, or more than 100 billion pounds valued at $63 billion.  The FAO estimates an additional 88 billion pounds of fish will be required by 2030 just to maintain current levels of consumption, and that will be provided by farmed fish.Brown seaweed busts belly fat – More research is showing that some kinds of seaweed can fight fat. Chemists in Japan have found that brown seaweed, used in many Asian soups and salads, contains a compound that appears to promote weight loss by reducing the accumulation of fat.  The results were presented recently at the 232nd meeting of the American Chemical Society.In the study, which was funded by the Japanese government, more than 200 obese animals that were fed the brown seaweed achieved a five to ten percent weight loss. The compound, which comes from a pigment that gives the seaweed its color, targeted belly fat in particular, the researchers said. The compound appeared to stimulate a protein that causes fat oxidation and conversion of energy to heat. The protein is found in the type of fat that surrounds internal organs, especially in the abdominal area.  The brown seaweed used in the study is a type of kelp that is widely consumed in Japan. The same kelp forests are also abundant along the California coast. The research could represent a huge market if the brown kelp compound can be developed into a natural extract or drug to help fight obesity. Human studies are planned, but the researchers said it may take three to five years before a fat busting pill is on the market.<COL>Fish … It’s what’s for lunch<COL>2006-09-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/10/salmon-harvest-hits-low/<COL>Salmon harvest hits lowLaine WelchHeadlines so far have heralded how Alaska’s salmon catches will come up short for the 2006 season. The statewide harvest for all species is projected “at best” to approach 140 million salmon, down 37 percent from last year’s record haul of 221 million fish. Regardless, the fishery should ring in at a respectable $304 million at the docks, compared to $334 million last year.“It marks the first time in ten years that we’ve had back to back salmon harvests that topped $300 million, and it almost doubles the low point of $162 million in 2002,” said market expert Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Research Group, the first to come out with an official value for the 2006 fishery. Here is an early look at other season highlights:For sockeye salmon, the “financial backbone” of the salmon industry, the harvest of 41 million fish was higher than expected and ranks at #13 in the record books. “From a market standpoint, for the past three years sockeye catches have been relatively strong for sockeye. So you’ve got a fairly strong supply meeting increasing demand, especially from the U.S. and Europe,” McDowell said. It also points to an ongoing market shift away from Alaska’s primary and traditional sockeye buyer – Japan.Much of the market growth also has to do with a change in fish products, from frozen, headed/gutted fish to fillets.  “In the past ten years almost all growth in the U.S. salmon market has been in fillets. Alaska is adding fillet lines fast throughout the state, especially for sockeye,” McDowell said.On the down side, the value of the 2006 sockeye salmon harvest to fishermen might decline. “Traditionally, sockeye from Bristol Bay receives lower prices than other regions for a variety of reasons. This year 70 percent of Alaska’s sockeye catch will come from Bristol Bay, and much of that will go into cans, so the overall value will skewdownwards,” McDowell said. Smaller fish weights for Bristol Bay fish, averaging less than six pounds, will also put a downward press on the overall value.One of the most exciting market outlooks continues for Alaska’s “bread and butter” salmon: pinks. The harvest of 70 million was down by a third of projections, and well below last year’s record catch of 140 million fish. “We went from a record harvest to the lowest in about 20 years,” McDowell said.There has been a major shift for pink salmon for the past three years, from cans to frozen fish. Last year, for example, 55 percent of Alaska’s pink catch went into cans compared to more typical packs of  75-78 percent in the recent past.McDowell pegged the average price for pinks this year at 14-cents a pound, up from 12-cents last year. He said there is strong market demand for pink salmon and people are looking forward to a good run next year. “The parent year for those pinks comes from the record run in 2005,” McDowell said.Looking at other species: the 2006 chum harvest of 20 million ranks in the top five. Chum prices also continued an upward trend, averaging 30-32 cents a pound. Demand outpaced supply for Alaska’s king salmon catch of 580,000 and prices topped $4/lb in some regions. McDowell said the coho market is “on fire” and posted the highest prices ever at $2.85/lb for Southeast trollers, and about $1/lb for gillnetters.McDowell said all indications point to an encouraging future for Alaska’s salmon industry.  “In general, salmon is on a roll, and wild in particular.  “The strong interest in pink salmon is especially exciting – it makes up more than half of our total harvest tonnage, so when there is increased demand for pinks, that adds up to hundreds of thousands of tons of Alaska salmon,” he said.Fish donations fuel sea lion research – Sea lions at the Alaska Sea Life Center in Seward always have full bellies, due in great part to donations of Bering Sea pollock.“It began with the need for diet studies,” said curator Richard Hocking. “For awhile we were purchasing pollock, and then got to a point where we needed to have fish of a certain size to match the requirements of the research. Members of the fleet agreed they could sustain our needs with the sizes and quantities and quality we needed. That started in 1999 and continues to the present time,” he said.Diet studies have been critical to Alaska’s fishing industry due to closures stemming from drastic declines in Westward sea lion numbers. Many claimed that removals of pollock by fishing boats were a probable cause.Hocking said boats belonging to a Bering Sea pollock fishing co-op sort out the smaller 10-14 inch fish needed for the feeding studies, which aim to mirror meals that the sea lions’ eat in the wild. To date the fleet has donated 191,600 pounds of pollock to the Center.“That adds up to about $70,000 worth of products that would have otherwise been processed into other products. We’re glad to donate it towards marine research,” said Jim Gilmore of the At-sea Processors Association, whose members participate in the project. Samson Tug and Barge has also donated shipping from Dutch Harbor to the Sea Life Center in Seward “from the get go,” said Curator Hocking, valued at more than $35,000.Hocking said the Center’s three resident sea lions eat between 20 and 40 pounds of pollock per day, and it is also enjoyed by ten harbor seals.  “It’s kind of funny –our staff names the fish by the different boats that catch it,” he said.Feeding studies over the past seven years show that the marine mammals thrive on diets with or without pollock. Researchers claim that drops in population of Steller sea lions more likely stem from disease, predation or a mix of other unknowns. Program director Donald Calkins said he does not believe the decline stems from fishing. “I’ve been working on this problem for close to three decades and I’ve never been able to connect those dots, he saidUnfortunately, all Steller sea lion research done elsewhere was terminated in June by a U.S. District Court ruling that found federal managers had failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in issuing research permits last year. The lawsuit, which was brought by the U.S. Humane Society, suspended all field research pending completion of an environmental impact statement in 2007.Crab catches crunched -  Despite indications that the crab stocks appear to be ticking upwards and might handle higher harvests, fishery managers reduced the 2006/07 catch quotas for Alaska’s largest crab fisheries: king and snow crab in the Bering sea.  The total quota for the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery, which opens on October 15th, will be just over 15.2 million pounds, down about 15 percent from last year. Part of the reduction comes from a nearly five percent cut right off the top due to excessive high grading of king crab last season.For snow crab, which typically gets underway in mid January, the catch quota was set at just over 36.5 million pounds, down about two percent from last season.  The catch for bairdi Tanner crab will nearly double to about three million pounds.Market analyst Ken Talley said imports of all species of king crab to the U.S. through July topped 42 million pounds, a whopping 103 percent increase over the same time last year. For snow crab, Talley said imports from Canada to the U.S. reached 74 million pounds, a gain of 16 percent from last year. Canada is by far the largest supplier of snow crab to the U.S. with a market share of 92 percent. Alaska’s king and Tanner crab fisheries from all regions of the state last year were valued at nearly $152 million dollars at the docks.<COL>Salmon harvest hits low<COL>2006-10-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/10/october-seafood-month/<COL>October: Seafood monthBy Maggie WallOctober is a great month for seafood lovers.  It’s National Seafood Month, so expect your favorite consumer magazines to be running lots of snippets on the glories of seafood along with tempting recipes to help celebrate the month.This is good for Alaska’s commercial fishers. The more aware consumers are of the value of fish to a healthy diet, the more they’ll eat and the better the demand for Alaska’s No. 2 industry. While it falls behind the oil industry in dollars generated, the fishing industry is the state’s No. 1 employer.Dutch Harbor has ranked at the top of U.S. fishing ports for more than 15 years. Kodiak routinely falls somewhere around third place behind Dutch and New Bedford, Mass.Alaska produces more than half of all U.S. seafood—more than all other states combined.Looking out across the country, the number one eaten fish species per capita is shrimp, followed by canned tuna and salmon. Pollock, largely found in fish sticks and fish sandwiches, was number four. This is from a National Fisheries Institute’s report based on 2004 consumption records. The other two Alaska fish on the top ten eaten list are crab and cod, at numbers seven and eight, respectively.Americans fondness for fish continues to increase with consumers now eating more than 16 pounds of seafood per year. Unfortunately, much of that fish is imported product, which accounts for 78 percent of U.S. consumption.  The other downer is that — according to the National Fisheries Institute — Americans should be eating twice that amount in order to meet government recommended standards for healthy living.Overall, we — Americans as a whole, not us fish crazy Alaskans — eat only about 5 ounces of fish a week. Dietary professions recommend at least two servings per week. While different fish products have varying amounts of fish per serving, you can put this into perspective by looking at that pantry staple, tuna. Your basic can of tuna is 6 ounces with a serving size of 2 ounces. That means American consumers eat less fish per week than is in a can of tuna.When we look at fish eaters around the world that 16 pounds per year consumed in America is nothing compared to what the island nations eat. The Japanese eat 146 pounds of seafood per person, while in Iceland it’s 200 pounds and it’s 186 pounds in Greenland.Interestingly enough, figures show the country with the lowest consumption of seafood is Afghanistan, which eats so little it doesn’t even register on the chart.The highest per-capita fish consumption is on the South Pacific Island of Tokelau, where each person averages more than 440 pounds every year. Try converting that using our tuna-can measure.Consumer Prices UpAnd while American consumers are eating more fish, they can expect to pay more as the suppliers hustle to keep up with demand.Seafood Dot Com reports that consumer prices for seafood climbed faster that competing sources of protein foods. Competing proteins include beef, pork and poultry, among others.An analysis of data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that consumer prices for seafood is up the past year by 4.5 percent. That compares to beef, which dipped half a percentage point and poultry that fell by nearly 3 percent. Consumer pork prices stayed almost the same as a year ago.Seafood Dot Com says the rise in seafood price is the result of a swing from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market. We’re probably most familiar with those phrases in relation to the housing market. And just like with home sales, when there are more people out there looking to buy fish, the prices rise as the seller benefits from the increased demand.And, as already mentioned, that increased demand for healthy sources of protein is great for the Alaska economy.As you might expect the price of fresh fish has increased more than the price of frozen products. Overall, fresh fish saw a more than six percent rise in prices from July of 2005 to July  of 2006. That compares to frozen products, which increased by just over 2 percent during the same yearly period.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics wholesale prices are up even more percentage wise. Wholesale salmon prices are up 35 percent from July to July. Cod is up 22 percent and pollock is up a whopping 74 percent.Now keep in mind, these prices include all fish products sold in the United States and include the price of imports.Maggie Wall is an award-winning journalist based in Kodiak. Laine Welch will be back next week.<COL>October: Seafood month<COL>2006-10-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/10/fall-fishery-gets-underway/<COL>Fall fishery gets underwayIt’s amazing how many people think Alaska’s fisheries end when salmon season is over.  In fact, October launches a whole line of fishing seasons that last long into the winter.On Oct. 1, for example, lucrative dive fisheries open in Southeast Alaska where hundreds of hookah-rigged divers head down to harvest million pounds of pricey sea cucumbers, red urchins and giant geoduck clams. Smaller dive fisheries also occur at the same time around Kodiak, Chignik and the Alaska Peninsula.  The fall Dungeness crab season and several shrimp fisheries also kick off in Southeast on Oct. 1, followed by a red king crab opener in November.Alaska’s largest crab fisheries in the Bering Sea take center stage starting on Oct. 15th for red king crab in the eastern waters, better known as Bristol Bay, and for snow crab and its larger cousin, bairdi Tanner crab. Those fisheries are operating for the second time under a quota share system that can stretch out the seasons for several months. The red king crab fishery is likely to last into December, while the snow crab fishery won’t really get underway until January and could run through April.Halibut and sablefish (black cod) seasons remain in full swing for another month (see following article).  Various boats throughout the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea may also be targeting herring, flatfish and other groundfish species this month and longer.Getting back to Alaska salmon — just when you think it’s all over, Southeast trollers were back out on the water Oct. 11 for the start of the winter king season. That will run through April 30, or until 45,000 kings are caught. That means that except for about two weeks until the Copper River fishery begins in mid-May, wild Alaska salmon is available nearly year round.On a related note: people often speak of theeconomic woes of “the industry” when they are referring specifically to Alaska salmon, and the pounding it has taken in world markets for the past decade or so due to cheaper farmed fish. Alaska’s seafood industry includes much more than just salmon, and it is important to make that distinction when talking about “the industry” as a whole.Halibut, sablefish prices continue to climb – Halibut prices started off last winter at well over $3 a pound in major ports and they have continued to tick upward to unheard of levels. In fact, the halibut price was up by more than $1 at the docks for all sizes since June.At Kodiak, for example, halibut prices were hovering at $4.30 for 10 to 20 pounders, $4.55 for fish weighing 20 to 40 pounds, and up to $4.85 for larger sizes. Halibut prices at Homer were reported at $4.65 to $5.50 on a three-way split. In Dutch Harbor, halibut was fetching $3.60, $3.95 and $4.35 a pound. And in Southeast, halibut prices were at $4.10, $4.30 and $4.80. Several buyers called the upward spiral “incredible,” “nuts” and “spooky” and worried that the fish would price itself out of favor in the marketplace. But by all accounts, both fresh and frozen markets were going strong. Top ports for halibut landings are Homer, Kodiak, Seward, Sitka, Dutch Harbor and Juneau.Prices also continued through the ceiling for sablefish, or black cod. That market is split into five sizes and at Kodiak, the prices ranged from $3.20 for the smallest weights to $4.55 a pound for fish over seven pounds. Sablefish at Homer had reached a high of $4.60 for larger sizes. At Dutch Harbor, prices were at $3.60 to $4.55 a pound.   Sablefish was fetching $3.10 to $4.60 in Southeast. Top ports for sablefish landings are Seward, Sitka, Dutch Harbor and Kodiak.With just one month left to go, Alaska longliners have taken 90 percent of the 53.3 million pound halibut catch limit. For sablefish, the total harvest is at 83 percent of the nearly 35 million pound quota. Both fisheries end on November 15th  and will reopen in late February or early March.Doctor’s orders: take fish oil – Every patient who survives a heart attack at the San Filippo Neri Hospital in Italy goes home with a prescription for purified fish oil that contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. The New York Times reported last week that Italian cardiologists believe so strongly in its preventive powers, they say  it is considered “tantamount to malpractice in Italy to omit fish oils from treatment.”Studies around the world have shown that fish oil improves survival rates after heart attacks and reduces often fatal irregular heart rhythms. In the largest study conducted more than a decade ago, Italian researchers gave 11,000 heart attack patients one gram of prescription fish oil a day. After three years, the study found that the number of deaths was reduced by 20 percent, and the number of sudden deaths by 40 percent compared with a control group.But in the United States, heart attack victims are seldom given omega-3 fatty acids. Instead, they are routinely offered more expensive and invasive treatments, like pills or implantable defibrillators.A study published last month in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17 percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish oil to their patients, including those who had suffered a heart attack. Experts said the fact that patients receive such different treatments in sophisticated hospitals around the world highlights the central role that drug companies play in disseminating medical information.  Because prescription fish oil is not licensed to prevent heart disease in the U.S., drug companies may not legally promote it for that purpose.The Times also noted that some doctors won’t regard fish oil as an effective preventive treatment because it is a nutritional supplement. American doctors interviewed said, “most cardiologists here are not giving omega-3’s even though the data supports it — there’s a real disconnect.”  Fish oil is the fastest growing nutritional supplement in the market today.<COL>Fall fishery gets underway<COL>2006-10-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/01/halibut-late-for-dinner/<COL>Halibut late for dinnerLaine WelchPacific halibut will make it to market a bit later this year, there will be less of it, and bag limits will cut charter boat catches by half.U.S. and Canadian halibut managers announced at their annual meeting last Friday that the commercial halibut fishery will begin on March 10, five days later than last year. They approved a coast-wide catch — meaning for California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska — of 65.1 million pounds, a drop of nearly 4.7 million pounds. Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the catch, but it will also see a reduced take to 52.36 million pounds, down about three million pounds from the 2006 limit.Some highlights: Fishermen in Southeast Alaska got a bit of a break with a catch of 8.5 million pounds. That’s still a drop of two million pounds, but not the 30 percent reduction that had been recommended earlier.For Area 3A, the Central Gulf, the halibut catch was boosted by one million pounds to 26.2 million pounds. Area 3A, the Western Gulf, took the biggest hit with a catch set at 9.2 million pounds, a drop of 3.6 million pounds from last year.Halibut charter boat operators were crying foul over the panel’s decision to cut client bag limits from two to one fish per day for part of the summer in Southeast and South Central regions. Charter operators have exceeded their sports halibut catches by nearly 50 percent in Southeast, and by nine percent in the Central Gulf of Alaska.Unless federal regulators (via the North Pacific Council) take no restrictive action prior to June, a bag limit of one halibut per day will be in place during June and July for Southeast charter operators, and one fish per day during June in the Central Gulf. Some operators are vowing to sue or fight to stop the cut to their daily sport catches.Back to the commercial halibut fishery — a coast-wide drop of nearly five million pounds drop will likely keep prices high. Last year, halibut prices started off well over $3/lb in major ports (sometimes topping $4/lb), and stayed there until the fishery closed in mid-November. Roughly 2,500 Alaska longliners are lucky enough to hold halibut quota shares. The dockside (ex-vessel) value of the 2006 Alaska halibut fishery topped $193 million, up $25 million dollars from 2005.Area    2006 AK Catch    2007 AK Catch2C (Southeast)    10.63        8.513A (Central Gulf)    25.20        26.23B (Western Gulf)    10.86        9.224A (Aleutians)    3.35        2.894B (Bering Sea)    1.67        1.444CDE (Bering Sea)   3.55           4.10Total    55.26        52.36The International Pacific Halibut Commission, originally called the International Fisheries Commission, was established in 1923 by a convention between the governments of Canada and the United States.

The mid-January fishery attracted a fleet of 53 boats, which will compete for just 800,000 pounds of bairdi Tanners, down from two million last year. Bairdi are the larger cousin of the more popular “opies” (opilio Tanner), or snow crab.Local bairdi crab stocks have been slowly rebounding in recent years, and with that has come renewed market interest.“It’s been tough to rebuild that market,” said Matt Moir, general manager of Alaska Pacific Seafoods. “It’s kind of it’s own little thing. With no bairdi markets for the last couple years, it’s fallen into a category of jumbo opilio. But we’re trying to turn that around.”“The last couple of years have been pretty tough on the Alaska crab market, but we’re encouraged this year. Hopefully, we’ll get good quality crab and things will be significantly better than the last couple of years,” Moir added. The advance price to fishermen was $1.75/lb, up from $1.40 in 2006.Kodiak crab managers also are encouraged about the outlook for the local bairdi crab stocks. “We see another very strong pulse of smaller crab throughout the island, and it’s much wider spread. So it’s very promising for future fisheries, probably three years down the road,” said state management biologist Nick Sagalkin.Prevent ratsU.S. Fish and Wildlife agents are hoping to find a lot of takers for free rat prevention kits being offered to all Alaska mariners. Their hope is to stop the rodents from getting ashore where they damage property, spread disease and kill wildlife.On fishing boats, rats are notorious for chewing through wiring or nets. The rodents readily jump ship when a vessel ties up at a port.“They can swim like crazy,” said Becky Beaty, a formed Kodiak harbor officer.Besides causing damage on fishing boats, rats are voracious predators on bird eggs. Fish and Wildlife estimates that most of the more than 40 million breeding seabirds in Alaska, about half of all seabirds in North America, nest on islands throughout Alaska.Fleas from rats also can carry diseases — perhaps most famously, the Black Plague that spread through Europe in the 14th century and killed millions. The fleas arrived there via ratsriding aboard Southeast Asia spice trade boats.A female rat can breed from the age of three months, and produce new litters of up to nine babies every three weeks. Two rats can equal 15,000 rats in one year. While it is impossible to get rid of rats, the Fish and Wildlife Service believes stopping them from getting ashore is a key to keeping the population under control.Rat prevention kits made available to mariners in the past weren’t too successful. “It was like talking about sexually transmitted diseases; nobody wanted to admit to having a problem,” one Alaska harbormaster told the Alaska Journal of Commerce.  Get more information at alaskamaritime@fws.gov.<COL>Halibut late for dinner<COL>2007-01-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/10/fish-refuge-proposed-near-pebble/<COL>Fish refuge proposed near PebbleLaine WelchA first of its kind fish refuge is being proposed to state policy makers as a way to protect fish habitat in headwaters of Bristol Bay. It includes lower and upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River, waters that are adjacent to the site of the open pit gold and copper mine being proposed by Northern Dynasty of Canada.“The law has been on the books for a long time that the state Board of Fisheries (BOF) can establish sanctuaries, reserves or refuges,” said George Matz of Homer, sponsor of Proposal 121. “I chose a refuge because it allows for consumptive use. Basically, we need some kind of protection for fish habitat to allow for continuing uses of commercial, sport and subsistence fishing,” he added.Matz, a retired state policy analyst and former game board member, said the concept is new to Alaska.“In the past, refuges have generally been set aside for both fish and game and included both water and land. Proposal 121 is specific to state waters and thereby avoids land use issues,” he explained, adding that his request predates all others for water rights.“A refuge also puts permitting authority into the hands of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and not the Department of Natural Resources. With so many fish issues at stake, I think that’s advisable in this case,” Matz said.The proposal also mandates that a management plan for the fish refuge would be created by a citizen’s advisory committee.Matz said the refuge could not in and of itself stop the Pebble Mine, but  it would hold the Canadian developers more accountable.“It makes them live up to their promises of no net loss of wild fish that spawn or rear in these waters.  So it protects the habitat and basically says the fish come first. It will be a true test as to whether they can meet that standard,” he said.Deadline to comment on Proposal 121 to the Board of Fish is Nov. 17. The board will rule on the fish refuge during its Dec. 4 through 12 meeting in Dillingham. If it gets the nod, the refuge must then be approved by the Alaska legislature.Crab market kick – Alaska king crab could get some relief from a ramped up marketing blitz during the peak holiday sales season. Alaska’s king crab market has been badly pinched in recent years due primarily to an influx of cheaper crab from Russia to the United States, much of it caught illegally.At the same time, there is a lot of consumer awareness of Alaska king crab from the Discovery Channel’s show Deadliest Catch.“We put the problem and an opportunity together and asked for a new injection of money to promote Alaska king crab in the U.S. marketplace,” said Arni Thomson, director of the Alaska Crab Coalition.In response, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute earmarked $500,000 from its budget and obtained $750,000 in matching funds from the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board. The $1.25 million will fuel a TV ad campaign to create more “brand awareness” of Alaska king crab on the Food Network, and other promotional outlets.  The ads will begin next month and continue through the peak holiday sales season.“We’ll use the messages of sustainability, taste and uniqueness to try and separate Alaska king crab from the other stuff on the market, much as we’ve done for Alaska wild salmon over the past few years,” said ASMI director, Ray Riutta.The crab industry is hoping to soon merit an eco-label by the international Marine Stewardship Council to help buyers easily identify Alaska crab as coming from a well managed fishery.“There is increasing consumer awareness and concern about seafood products being harvested in a responsible manner,” said the ACC’s Thomson. “Alaska crab is managed under sustainable principles and practices. That is not the case with Russian king crab and there is a lot of overfishing going on.”ASMI’s Riutta said the fall promotion is a good first step to rebuilding Alaska’s market niche, but it won’t happen overnight: “It’s going to take time and we’ll need some more money downstream. But it’s a good shot in the arm at the peak sales season and hopefully, it will boost the crab price.” Riutta added.The Alaska red king crab fishery got underway a few days after the Oct. 15th opening date, after crabbers and buyers negotiated price agreements. Most settled on a base price of $3.65/lb, down almost one dollar from last year.Aleutia brand expands – Aleutian Islands fishermen have sealed a deal that will expand sales of their Aleutia brand sockeye salmon, and allow more people to get involved in the local fishery.The Aleutia group was formed five years ago by fishing families who wanted to spotlight the region’s ocean run sockeye.  This week Aleutia signed a six-figure licensing agreement with the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association. It allows APICDA to use the Aleutia name and logo to market sockeye from a new plant it is building in False Pass, expected to open next year.  Fishermen also plan to expand into halibut, sablefish and other fisheries at the new plant.“It’s a boost to the local economies because it gets the local fleet out there fishing for their own brand of fish. It’s a really good fit, and it will help us in our goal to be self-sustaining,” said Aleutia president Bob Barnett of Sand Point.Barnett added that the False Pass plant will be a big money saver to local fleets because it is closer to the fishing grounds. “It will save three to four hours in travel time instead of running   all the way to King Cove. It will also provide savings in tender service,” he said.This year, 40 local fishing families from Sand Point and King Cove harvested roughly 130,000 pounds of sockeye salmon for the Aleutia program.“Our long term plan is to increase by 10 percent each year on fishermen, and increase the volume bought and sold. We have quite a market presence now and it’s growing year by year,” Barnett said.  Fishermen fetched 35 percent more for their Aleutia brand sockeye salmon this year, compared to the average price of 60 cents for other fish.<COL>Fish refuge proposed near Pebble<COL>2006-10-25<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/02/whats-up-fishy-cat/<COL>What’s up fishy-cat?Laine WelchFor the 17th year in a row, Dutch Harbor remained the nation’s #1 fishing port for seafood landings. The (belated) annual report just released by NOAA Fisheries showed that commercial fishermen offloaded 887.6 million pounds of fish and shellfish at Dutch Harbor in 2005, the latest figures available. The catch represents a 1.2 million pound increase from the previous year.Kodiak was the only other Alaska port making the top 10 list for seafood landings, ranking as number four in the nation. A total of 373.4 million pounds crossed the Kodiak docks in 2005, an increase of almost 20 million pounds from the previous year.The port of New Bedford, Mass. once again claimed the top spot for value of seafood landings, setting a record at $282.5 million, an increase of $75 million from 2004. That was due to continued sky high scallop prices at New Bedford. Dutch Harbor ranked a distant second for landing values at $166.1 million. Kodiak ranked third for seafood values at $95.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million from 2004.Three other Alaska ports made the top 10 list for seafood values: #8 was Naknek-King Salmon at $54.3 million (up $11.8 million from 2004); #9 was Seward at $52.2 million (up $8.6 million); and Cordova ranked #10 with seafood landings valued at $46.5 million, an increase of $14.7 million.Total U.S. fish and shellfish landings for 2005 were 9.6 billion pounds, valued at $3.9 billion at the docks. The complete list for all U.S. port rankings will be available on Monday, a NOAA Fisheries spokesperson said. Find it at www.nmfs.noaa.gov <http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/>.U.S .seafood consumption dips — Americans ate slightly less seafood in 2005, according to the popular top ten list compiled each year by the National Fisheries Institute.

Pebble would be the largest open pit copper and gold mine in North America.“The very development of Pebble is an industry unto itself,” said UFA environmental chairman Bruce Wallace, after the annual meeting wrapped up on Thursday in Juneau.“Clearly, one of the things we’re going to do is demand is that all of the appropriate testing, particularly as it relates to surface and subsurface water, be done,” he added. Wallace said UFA will provide a white paper on its Pebble Mine decision in coming weeks.UFA also selected a slate of fish issues it will bring before Alaska lawmakers this year.Topping the list, support for halibut quota shares for sport charters, whose catches have skyrocketed in some regions.We feel that the sport charter halibut sector needs to pony up and sit at the table with us and take some responsibility for conservation and longer term allocations,” said outgoing UFA president Bobby Thorstenson, Jr.Alaska fishermen are also going to bat for the Dept. of Fish and Game budget, which so far is facing a $150 million cut.“We feel that the fish and game budget has been woefully under-funded for at least two decades. Meanwhile, the fishing industry has taken on more responsibility and paid more taxes and fees. Cutting the fish and game budget is unacceptable,” Thorstenson said, adding that UFA will be pushing for a $4 million increase for the department.UFA also has come out strongly against a law being proposed by Senators Murray and Spanel of Washington, (SB 5207), that would impose a fee on all shipping containers. The law would create and fund a “freight congestion relief account,” said UFA statewide chair, Kathy Hansen.“The fee would be $50 per 20-foot container. So a 40-foot container, (the shipping standard), would be $100. That’s for both directions — inbound and outbound — on all products,” Hansen said.David Otte of Southern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association said his group sends almost 1,800 vans to or from Washington each year. The container fee would add a cost of $180,000.“It may seem like a kind of innocuous bill, but it has huge ramifications for Alaska,” he said.UFA also elected a new president, Joe Childers of Juneau. He replaces Thorstenson, who is stepping down after seven years at the UFA helm. United Fishermen of Alaska represents 35 regional fishing groups and several thousand members, making it one of the nation’s largest industry trade groups.Oh my, those Omega 3sOmega 3 fatty acids will be the most popular food additive this year, according to USA Today. Omega 3s are credited with helping to prevent heart disease, strokes, arthritis and Alzheimer’s, to name a few. Four in 10 adults are seeking more Omega 3s in their diets, a USA Health Trend Survey revealed, especially the nation’s 80 million baby boomers.Omegas can’t be produced by our bodies and must be obtained from foods, notably fish and some plant sources.“It has just been in the last few decades as we’ve industrialized our food supply that we’ve almost eradicated this nutrient from our diet. When you don’t get it, all kinds of bad things start happening,” said Randy Hartnell of Vital Choice Seafoods.  (www.vitalchoice.com)Studies now show that not all omegas are created equal. Nutrition experts claim that the most essential Omega 3 fatty acid — called DHA — is far more abundant in fish oils than any other food source.Omega 3s were added to 250 U.S. food products last year and the number is growing fast. This month Tropicana is launching the first orange juice fortified with Omega 3, and Kellogg is adding it to some cereals. Natural food company, Earth’s Best, will include Omega 3 in its infant formula to help enhance brain development.The pet industry got a jump on the people. Iams added Omega 3 to its puppy chow last year to boost the brains of growing dogs.

The State Department of Revenue is expected to release its annual “score card” for the 2006 salmon fishery any day.The Alaska Salmon Price Report will provide first wholesale prices and sales volumes for key salmon products: canned salmon, fresh and frozen/headed and gutted, fresh and frozen fillets and salmon roe.The Annual Production Report will tell exactly how much salmon was processed by Alaska seafood companies last year.“It allows us to pin down what we produced and what was the real growth in products like fillets, which are of great interest to many people,” said analyst Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Group, which tracks and translates the salmon data in reports to the industry.Looking at some 2006 salmon highlights:  Alaska chum salmon continued to show substantial price recovery at the docks, from $.19 pound three years ago to $.31 per pound. (The 20-year average is $.32).“The dockside value was about $56 million, and 18 percent of Alaska’s total salmon value was chums,” McDowell said. A record chum catch of 24.7 million fish is projected for Alaska this year.Coho salmon was a sleeper that really woke up last year. The statewide average price was nearly $1 per pound not including bonuses. In Southeast Alaska, troll-caught cohos fetched a record $2.85 per pound.Fewer Alaska pink salmon are ending up in cans, going instead into pricier frozen fillets. Ten years ago, 80 percent of the pink catch would be canned; now it’s closer to a 50/50 split for canned and frozen pinks.Pink salmon are not expected to pull another no-show in 2007, as they did in major Alaska regions last year, notably Southeast.“The parent year for the 2007 pink return was 2005, which was the largest pink salmon harvest on record at 161 million fish,” McDowell said.For the past 20 years, on odd-numbered years, the pink-salmon catch has been 23 percent over projections. If that holds true,the Alaska catch could top 130 million pinks in 2007, McDowell said.Another big harvest could be a mixed blessing for  Alaska’s money fish – sockeye salmon.“Half to two-thirds of the total dockside value is from sockeye, and we haven’t seen a whole lot of movement in the past year or two,” McDowell said.Last year 70 percent of  Alaska’s sockeye catch of roughly 40 million came from  Bristol Bay, where prices remained in the  $.55 per pound range.  The sockeye were smaller than usual, making them less suitable for fillet production. That meant the bulk of the Bay’s red salmon went into cans in an already-crowded market.“It appears we’re entering into a time of oversupply for the canned sockeye market. And with high production coming from Bristol Bay, we’re looking at a pretty significant canned pack again,” McDowell said.Alaska king salmon prices continue to reflect the lack of availability of fish from Pacific coast fisheries, closed for conservation concerns. The average dock price last year was almost $2.80 per pound, the highest price in 25 years. Southeast trollers fetched $9.20 per pound for winter kings last week.“In terms of the price for king salmon, this is ‘the good old days’ right now,” said McDowell.State fish forecasters are predicting an Alaska salmon catch of 179 million fish this year, up 21.2 percent from the 2006 harvest of 141 million salmon.Crab babies hatchScientists are standing by like expectant parents, awaiting the hatch of the first batch of baby king crabs at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks Marine Center at Seward.“It’s really exciting. It’s the first time that we have ventured into culturing king crab,” said Brian Allee, director of Alaska Sea Grant and manager of the crab research program.     Researchers believe the hatchery program marks the first step in rebuilding wild king crab stocks in Alaska waters.The arrivals will be newborn red and blue king crab larvae, each only about the size of a finely sharpened pencil tip. In all, more than one million king crabs are expected to hatch at the facility in the coming weeks. Their mothers, 58 in all, were collected from waters around Kodiak and the Pribilof Islands.The first batch of crab will not be released into the wild, but will serve as test subjects for future generations. It will take several years, but the goal is to eventually release the crabs to their home waters.“Then they would contribute to the common property fishery. First and foremost, the crab will contribute to brood stock that will provide the seed for the future,” Allee said.The Alaska King Crab Research and Rehabilitation Program will be a feature at ComFish in Kodiak in March and at an open house March 24 at the Alutiiq Pride Hatchery in Seward.Fish fraud fixIt soon will be easier to make sure those fish you are buying are the real thing. Fish frauds are at an all-time high, and suppliers are too often substituting fakes for higher value species – farmed salmon for wild, for example, or tilapia or catfish for grouper.A project underway at Ontario’s Guelph University may soon allow people to test their own fish, even while sitting at a restaurant. Called the “Barcode of Life,” the project aims to build a genetic sequence database for every known plant and animal species on Earth.Researchers have developed a wireless, handheld device that can analyze a sliver of fish and identify it within minutes. They predict it will be widely used in five to 10 years.

However, a lack of harvesting labor data means there is no way to realistically estimate the number of crew members who work in any given community or census area.That hampers efforts by fisheries-dependent communities to influence public policy-making, build infrastructure and grow local economies, concludes a new report by Anchorage-based Northern Economics, Inc. Titled “Improving Seafood Harvesting Labor Data,” the report outlines ways in which collection and reporting of Alaska’s seafood harvesting labor data could be improved.”State and federal policy makers are often in the position of having to make decisions that will impact crew members and communities without having any historical information about the seafood harvesters. In fact, in most cases, policy-makers generally know more about the average fish than they do about the average fisherman,” said Wanetta Ayers, director of the Southwest Alaska Municipal Conference, which commissioned the report.Fishing crew are considered contract workers, not employees, so no wage and salary reporting is required by the state Dept. of Labor, explained report author Marcus Hartley. “The number of crew licenses is collected each year by communities, but those are general to all commercial fisheries,” Hartley said.A 2005 report by the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game summarizes the dilemma by stating: “Using existing data, it is not possible to know if the crewmember fished at all, where they fished, how much they fished, how many crew fished from a vessel, or how much they earned.”The lack of harvesting data also results in an inability of individuals and communities to access federal programs and grant funds that are readily available to others.“Without good data about the number of crewmembers and the amounts they are earning, communities really don’t have any basis for accurately estimating the effects of fishing,” Hartley said, adding that the problem applies to commercial fisheries throughout the United States.U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety officers have long been concerned that anyone can get a crew license, walk the docks, and hop aboard a boat with no real record of who they are or where they’re going. That should also cause worry for immigration and security agencies, Hartley said.Federal and state agencies are working hard to find ways to improve the system, but right now there is no regulatory mandate to do so.“Without that, agencies are probably reluctant to spend the extra  money to go after the information because money is short, and there are so many things they already have to do to manage the fisheries,” said Hartley.“This is an issue for all fisheries-dependent communities. It’s up to all stakeholders to advocate for changes and generate the support needed to make those changes a reality,” said Ayers.Hartley will present the report at the ComFish trade show next month in Kodiak.

The contest was created three years ago by the World Wildlife Fund, which this year is offering $30,000 in cash to the winning entry and two $10,000 runners-up awards.The entries are judged on innovation, practicality, and cost effectiveness to implement or produce the gear, said WWF spokesman Mike Osmond.”The entry must also maintain the target catch. You don’t want to have something that reduces bycatch but at the same affects the target species. Otherwise, there is very little chance of getting it adopted,” Osmond said.Along with cash, all winners receive help in further testing and refining their gear. Last year’s winner was a New Jersey inventor who designed gear that uses a shark’s ability to detect magnetic fields through its snout. He placed strong magnets just above baited hooks on longlines and found that it repelled sharks while not reducing catches of tuna and swordfish. Osmond said federal fishery managers conducted very successful trials on the gear last summer and it will soon be adopted in  U.S. and world waters.The 2006contest attracted 83 entries from 26 countries, including four from Alaska. Find entry forms at www.smartgear.org . Deadline to enter is July 31st.Git ‘er DownHe was not a Smart Gear contest winner, but that didn’t stop Alaskan Ace Callaway from refining and patenting a gear to protect fragile rockfish. Callaway lives in Fairbanks and operates a sports charter boat each summer out of  Valdez.“When you break rockfish out of deep water they don’t have the ability to equalize the pressure, and their bladder expands and pushes their eyes out the sockets and the stomach out of their mouths. It’s a horrible sight. They basically suffer the same thing a diver does that comes up too fast – what we normally call the bends,” Callaway said.There are more than 30 kinds of rockfish and they’re some of the most fascinating fish in the world. Rockfish can live more than 200 years, they have live babies, and they range less than a quarter mile from where they are born.Callaway’s simple gear uses a pair of mechanical jaws that hooks onto the fish’s lip, quickly re-submerges it to the proper depth and releases it unharmed. It is modeled after studies by the Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife that showed rockfish returned to the deep have almost 100 percent survival rates. Callaway agrees that long term tagging studies should be done, but meanwhile, he  has a patent pending for his rockfish gear – and  the catchy name describes exactly what it does.“It’s called Git ‘er Down’,” he said with a laugh. That, of course, is a take off on ‘get ‘er done,’ the line made famous by the popular comedian, Larry the Cable Guy.Callaway said he has had offers by big companies to produce the rockfish gear elsewhere.But the inventor, who owns and runs a disabled veterans machine shop in Fairbanks, said the Git ‘er Down gear will be made “by him and his guys right here in Alaska.”ComFish/KodiakKodiak is gearing up for ComFish,  Alaska’s largest and longest running (28 years) fisheries trade show, and the only one held in a major fishing port.Among the featured fishery forums will be updates on the Exxon Valdez oil spill litigation, king crab mariculture, clues to the collapse of Kodiak’s king crab stocks, impacts of climate change on fisheries and coastal communities, PSP field test kits for shellfish, and offshore oil and gas drilling in  Bristol Bay and the southeastern  Bering Sea.”Local boy” Denby Lloyd, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner and Gov. Palin’s legislative director John Bitney will be on hand to discuss all things fishery related.

The industry standard is 40 feet.“So a 40-foot container would be taxed $100. That’s both directions – inbound and outbound – on all products,” said Kathy Hanson of the Southeast Alaska Fishermen’s  Alliance and statewide chair for United Fishermen of Alaska, which opposes the tax.The senators claim the money is needed to mitigate the enormous burden imposed on the state transportation system by the overland movement of cargo shipped to and from Washington State ports. The tax would be imposed on marine terminal operators, who would keep 10 percent to cover accounting costs. The remaining 90 percent would be spent on infrastructure improvements to state of  Washington ports.The people of Washington should pay for those improvements, not Alaskans, said Rep.  Bill Thomas (R-Haines). Thomas has sponsored a joint resolution (HJR 8)  opposing the container tax.  Thomas points out that the Alaska/Washington shipping connection provides $4 billion in commerce, and he suggests that  Washington find other ways to fund its port fix ups.Major Alaska seafood companies also oppose the measure “out of hand,” said Glenn Reed of the Pacific Seafood Processors Association. He said according to analyses done by the bill sponsors, 25 percent of the container traffic coming in and out of Washington ports are from Alaska. “I understand the first year the tax would be expected to raise more than $300 million and close to half a billion dollars in total taxes within three years – 25 percent of which would be impacting Alaskan trade,” Reed said.Reed said the bill is unlikely to pass at the $50 tax rate and “compromise” numbers are being bandied about. Meanwhile, Reed said Alaska shippers are considering doing business with alternative ports.“Depending on how many containers you ship, the numbers get pretty big, pretty quick,” he said.Retraining still available for fishermenThe bottom line of many  Alaska salmon fishermen was badly hurt for years by imports of cheaper farmed fish. But because Alaska salmon fishermen are officially considered as “agriculture producers” by the federal government, they qualified for numerous benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.Many fishermen received cash payouts of up to $10,000 from the United States Department of Agriculture as compensation for low salmon prices in 2003 and 2004. Those fishermen are still eligible for federally funded retraining benefits“Those who were eligible for money from USDA under either one of those benefit years have training benefits with United States Labor Department Trade Act program forever,” said Sandra Burgess, Trade Act program lead for the Alaska Labor Department in Juneau.Burgess said 93 fishermen have signed up for the various programs which include on the job training, vocational or academic. Many have opted to stay on the water, getting retrained in various merchant marine programs, including the Alaska ferry system.“Some of the fishermen have gone back to school and completed nursing programs, teaching degrees, truck driving and heavy equipment training, radiological technicians –  I even have someone in his last year of law school and two people in the culinary arts,” Burgess said.So far 57 fishermen have completed training programs and the remainder are continuing.“The completion rate for commercial fishermen has been very good – 70 percent have completed the program so far,” she added.Of more than 28,000 Alaska salmon permit holders only about 4,300 applied for TAA benefits from the USDA. Of that, 1,700 fishermen were approved.Get more information about Trade Act benefits at local AK Job Centers, or contact Burgess at (907) 465-5947 or Sandy_burgess@labor.state.ak.us .Protein trendsEven though Americans ate slightly less seafood in 2005, interrupting a four year upward trend, the 16.2 pounds per person still reflected the third largest seafood appetite in  U.S. history.In his latest Seafood Trend Newsletter, market analyst Ken Talley provides a closer look at  America’s eating habits. In terms of total volume, American seafood lovers ate 4.8 billion pounds of fish and shellfish in 2005 – making the  U.S. the world’s third largest seafood consumer, behind only  Japan and China. Unfortunately, nearly 80 percent of that seafood was imported to the U.S. from other countries.There was also a change in America’s preferred seafood product forms – they enjoyed 11.6 pounds of fresh and frozen seafood, the second highest ever.Canned seafood purchases declined 4.4 percent, mostly for canned tuna, while sales of canned salmon increased slightly.Americans also ate a record five pounds each of fillets and steaks, and nearly one pound each of fish sticks and portions.In all, Americans spent five percent more money on seafood purchases– restaurant sales of $44.5 billion showed an increase of 3.7 percent. The $20.5 billion spent at retail seafood counters in 2005 was up 7.2 percent.Seafood still has a long way to go to overtake other popular proteins. Beef held onto the top spot with Americans eating a whopping 62.4 pounds per person in 2005! Chicken is nipping at the heels of red meat at 60.4 pounds. Pork is number three at 46.5 pounds per person.Seafood ranked number four at a distant 16.2 pounds.  Turkey came in last on  America’s favorite protein list at 13.1 pounds per person.<COL>Alaska aims to sink shipping tax<COL>2007-02-21<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/03/7000-pounds-of-halibut-cross-homer-docks/<COL>7,000 pounds of halibut cross Homer docksLaine WelchPrices paid for halibut prior to the March 10 start of the fishing season have raised eyebrows among both buyers and fishermen.Each year fishery scientists conduct surveys in the winter to collect tissue samples from the spawning grounds, and during the summer to collect data on the halibut stocks. The research includes various areas – this year occurring off the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, in the  Central Gulf of Alaska and in Bering Sea waters along the Aleutian Chain.The researchers have special permits to offload and sell the halibut they catch in local ports. The landings are quite low, and prices intend to be inflated. But the pre-season landings do give an indication of market interest, and they can be summed up in a word – high.In early February, 7,000 pounds of halibut crossed the Homer docks and fetched $6.55 pound for all sizes.“That compared to an average price last summer of $3.77 pound. So there was a big jump interest over the winter,” said Claude Dykstra, survey manager for the International Pacific Halibut Commission which conducts the annual research.At Dutch Harbor, two deliveries in early February of 8,500 pounds and 10,000 pounds were broken out by size classes. Halibut weighing 10 to 20 pounds paid $3.60 pound; 20 – 40 pounders got $3.95 pound and larger sizes received $4.35 pound. The average price paid in Dutch during the summer was $3.41 pound, Dykstra said.One major Kodiak buyer said the pre-season landings by researchers have little bearing on the actual market. However, he agreed there is no doubt the halibut market will be strong, adding that prices are likely to hit $5 pound in some areas.“But when there’s that much of  an increase in value, it can go sour really fast and buyers will be extremely cautious,” he said.Starting prices for halibut last year approached or topped $4 a pound in major ports and seldom dipped below $3 during the eight month season. The statewide average price for 2006 was $3.71 pound.Alaska’s 2007 commercial halibut fishery has a catch limit of just over 52 million pounds.  The Halibut Commission has a call out for several research charters starting this summer, preferably for vessels over 55 feet.

In a game of ‘Aquatic Tennis’ (which would more correctly be called volleyball), ‘man and dolphin’ try to bang a fish sandwich past each other. In ‘Ocean Commotion,’ man tries to balance a sandwich on his nose longer than the more adept dolphin. And in a popular repeat from last year called ‘Sharkbait,’ players try to keep the Filet o Fish away from a swarm of hungry sharks. All games are timed, allowing gamers to compete with one another. The promotion, in both Spanish and English, also offers wallpapers, cell phone ring tones and T-shirts. Nearly all of McDonald’s fish sandwiches are made from Alaska pollock, and the company claims to sell more than 300 million sandwiches each year. (www.filetofish.com)And for the first time, Kentucky Fried Chicken is offering a fish sandwich at its more than 5,500 locations across the country during the 40 days of Lent. Called a Fish Snacker and selling for just 99 cents, the sandwich is made of 100 percent  Alaska pollock. To increase the new promotion’s visibility, KFC has asked Pope Benedict to bestow his blessing on the new menu item.  No word yet on whether Benedict will offer his papal approval.Farmed whitefish worries wild producersPeople are familiar with how farmed salmon competes with Alaska’s wild caught fish in world markets. In that case, it is lower prices—not availability,  that gives farmed salmon a toe hold. Today, demand for dwindling stocks of whitefish is prompting a boom in farmed varieties that compete with Alaska’s largest fisheries – cod and pollock.Industry watchers predict that in less than 10 years, world farmed cod production could top 440 million pounds. According to the latest Seafood Market Report by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, two freshwater fish pose an even bigger threat: farmed tilapia and pangasius.Imports of tilapia to the U.S. through October last year were nearly 276 million pounds, up 70 percent from the year before.  China imports 90 percent of all frozen tilapia, while  Costa Rica,  Ecuador and Honduras provide 90 percent of the fresh imports.  U.S. per capita consumption of tilapia grew 62 percent between 2003 and 2005, the report said.While tilapia has come to dominate the American market for farmed whitefish, pangasius has been developing as the darling of the European market. Pangasius, also called basa, is a type of shark catfish and it can grow to market size in just seven months.  Vietnam, the primary producer, sent more than 217 million pounds of farmed pangasius to Europe through October last year, an increase of 80 percent. In just a few more years,  Vietnam expects to produce more than two billion pounds and make more inroads into U.S. markets as well. By comparison,  Alaska’s 2007 catch quota for pollock is roughly three billion pounds.World consumption patterns favor seafood as more people are aware of its health benefits, combined with concerns over poultry and beef borne illnesses.  The ASMI report said farmed whitefish are “shifting the playing field” as they do an end run around the biological limitations occurring with wild catches.  (www.alaskaseafood.org)Sea lice from farms infect wild salmonSea lice from salmon farms threaten wild stocks in British Columbia.  That’s according to a report by Dr. Craig Orr of Watershed Watch, which covered waters of the Broughton Archipelago, an area between northern Vancouver Island and the mainland. Major crashes of wild pink and chum stocks coupled with high rates of sea lice have focused attention on fish farming and its role in salmon declines.Orr’s study was done in cooperation with Marine Harvest, one of  Canada’s largest fish farm companies. The project tracked sea lice production at 12 farm sites that use open net cages, containing between one and five million Atlantic salmon. Over an 18 month period in 2003 and 2004, the fish produced billions of lice eggs during the winter and spring, just prior to the seaward migration of the region’s wild salmon. (1.6 billion eggs were produced in just one two week period.)Orr’s study confirms earlier findings by University of Alberta researchers that showed sea lice infected up to 98 percent of all wild juvenile salmon in the Broughton waters. Studies of salmon farms off Scotland, Ireland and Norway have shown similar results. Orr’s study raises the question – if 12 farms produce billions of sea lice eggs, how many are the 85 active fish farms in British Columbia producing?In a token nod to the problem, B.C. policy makers in 2003 enacted a one time only plan that required farms to reduce sea lice numbers by early harvesting and chemical treatments. Some fish farmers, like Marine Harvest, are relocating their sites far away from wild salmon migration routes.  Environmentalists and fishermen say the only safe way to farm salmon with out harming wild stocks is to switch from net pens to closed containment systems. Orr’s sea lice study is in the February North American Journal of Fisheries Management.

It’s located at the northeast tip of the San Juan archipelago in Washington, near Bellingham.Reefnetting is perhaps the oldest form of net fishing in the world.  Called “the original and still the best in selective fishing” by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, it was done centuries ago by Native Americans using cedar canoes and cedar nets. Although the boats are bigger now and winches are used to pull the nets, there isn’t much difference in the fishing method to this day.Instead of chasing the fish with motorized boats, reefnet fishermen create an elaborate array of lines and ribbons that form a funnel shaped reef. As the fish swim along, they are forced upward and over into a large net suspended between two anchored barges.“We stand on towers on each barge and watch for the fish. When a school comes over the net, we lift it up with electric winches and spill the fish into a live well filled with slush ice,” explained Riley Starks of the Lummi Island Wild Coop.The winches are powered by banks of six-volt batteries, which must be ferried to shore for recharging.“For years we’ve talked about ways of rigging something up so we wouldn’t have to bring thousands of pounds of batteries in every night,” Starks said.The fishermen believe the sun will provide the solution.The co-op has partnered with Bellingham-based Alpha Energy to power the salmon fishery with solar panels. This spring Alpha Energy will donate and install the panels on three of the 11 barge/net operations (called “gears”) that comprise the reefnet fleet. Starks estimated the panels cost $10,000 per gear, and said the coop will expand solar energy to the entire fishery.“This is a perfect example of how solar power can save time, labor and money for a fishery or any business in a remote location,” said Matt Donnelly, Vice President of Alpha Energy. “These reefnet boats are in the water for months at a time and require constant power to operate. As long as the sun rises in the morning, they will have environmentally-friendly power.”The Lummi Island fish will use “solar salmon” tail tags as a marketing angle when the fishery gets underway in late July.“If we can get it into the mind of consumers that they’re doing something good by purchasing this fish — every little advantage helps,” Starks said.He added that overall, the concept means far more than money.“Solar technology could be used in lots of different salmon fisheries. Where the opportunity exists, it should be done to try and make our footprint on this earth as small as possible.” (www.lummiis-landwild.com )Halibut ‘hookie’The way that halibut behave around baited circle hooks tells fish scientists a lot about the stocks.“Our belief is that if fish over about 20 pounds bite a circle hook, they’re hooked. Most of the fish under 10 pounds that bite the hook don’t get hooked, and there is a pretty direct progression as size gets bigger of fish being caught,” said Steve Kaimmer, a biologist with the International Pacific Halibut Commission.This summer Kaimmer will observe how well the “hooking success” of halibut meshes with computer models.“We count the number of fish in each size group caught in the commercial fishery and our surveys, and estimate how many halibut are out there on the sea floor. We want to recreate with a good number of observations the hooking success on circle hooks that is being predicted by our stock assessment model,” he said.Kaimmer uses an  ”acoustic camera” that provides underwater sonogram images at any depths. His earlier observations revealed that halibut almost always come up current when they’re following a scent trail to baited gear.“A lot of times they would overshoot the baited hook, and then loop back around. At that time, I think they’re using vision because they’ve lost the scent. They often won’t take a bait right off the bat, but will sit five to 10 inches down current and just smell it for awhile. When it decides to take it, it gives a kick of its tail and grabs it on the run, so to speak. It’s very amusing,” he said.The IPHC is seeking a boat for the halibut research charter this summer.“What’s different about this charter is that we don’t need a longline vessel. We need a boat with a drum, a boom to swing the gear over the side and a nice back deck. It’s an opportunity for people who might not think about halibut research to get involved in our program,” Kaimmer said.The two-week project can occur anytime from June through August, and pays roughly $2,000 per day. Deadline for bids is March 21st.

(Only Brazil nuts have more.)   Selenium is essential to good health, and the best source comes from ocean fishes — both oily ones, like salmon or tuna, and whitefish like cod and pollock.Selenium is a key to producing antioxidants that help prevent cell damage in all living organisms. Major studies show that higher selenium levels are associated with substantially reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, which stems from plaque build up that destroys brain cells. That was the conclusion of a nine-year study in France, and more recently, in a study of 2,000 elderly Chinese by researchers from the Indiana University School of Medicine.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 4.5 million Americans. Health experts predict the number of cases could reach 16 million by 2050. The cost of caring for Alzheimer patients in the United States now tops $100 billion a year.On another front – selenium is being called a built-in safeguard against mercury in seafood. Research by Dr. Nicholas Ralston at the University of North Dakota found that selenium binds to the methyl mercury in seafood and renders it harmless. Ralston said that may explain why a large study in the Seychelles Islands, where children eat 12 times more fish than Americans, found no developmental deficits associated with mercury intake. Ralston’s studies found that the most popular fish eaten by Americans — including grouper, pollock, tuna, salmon, and flounder — all contained much more selenium than mercury.See “‘Seafood Mineral’ Selenium May Reduce Risk of Senility; Mercury-Fighting Mineral in Fish Overlooked”  at www.vitalchoice.com.<COL>Solar power to drive reefnet fishery<COL>2007-03-14<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/03/global-changes-warming-up/<COL>global changes warming upby Laine WelchGlobal warming is changing the distribution, abundance and behavior of important fish stocks, and it is occurring faster at northern latitudes. In recent years, fishermen and researchers have reported that Bering Sea boats must search farther north for pollock, and snow crab stocks are also on a steady march to colder waters.The North Pacific and Arctic oceans are especially vulnerable to the effects of global warming, because cold water absorbs carbon dioxide from fossil fuel emissions more readily. That has prompted Alaska fishery managers to expand protections for Arctic waters, even before potential problems arise.Last October, the North Pacific Council tasked its staff to prepare a discussion paper on options for expanding protections for resources of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. In December, the panel agreed to put in motion plans to develop a strategy that would potentially close Arctic waters north of the Bering Strait, and/or waters north of Point Hope, to commercial fishing until a fishery management plan is in place for any species not already covered under an existing plan.Because warmer waters are also reducing the number of smaller organisms that make up much of the marine food web, the plan could expand to include resources like krill and other forage species, said Dave Benton, a former North Pacific Fishery Management Council chairman and now director of the Marine Conservation Alliance.“It’s very unique for a management entity to actually say, ‘Let’s not do anything until we have a plan in place,’” Benton said.Such forward thinking tops the list of world conservationists, said Brad Warren of Seattle-based Natural Resources Consultants, and author of a new report called “Conserving Alaska’s Oceans.”“If you look at what conservation advocates want most in world fisheries, it is precaution. This is a good example of it,” Warren said.The North Pacific Council oversees management of fisheries in federal waters from three to 200 miles offshore, an area that encompasses 900,000 square miles. The NPFMC is scheduled to take up the issue of Arctic waters next month in Anchorage. Find the discussion paper at   www.fakr.noo.gov/npfmc/fmp/ArcticFMP.pdf  .  Contact is Bill Wilson.Offshore fish farm entrepreneursThe U.S. has an $8 billion seafood trade deficit, and imports 80 percent of the seafood that Americans consume, mostly from foreign aquaculture operations. The Bush Administration wants to turn that around and recently unveiled a revamped plan that moves offshore fish farming closer to reality.Congress is expected to pass laws that would allow companies to get 20 year permits to sink fish cages in federal waters, but without many of the rules on size, season and harvest methods that apply to other commercial fishermen.Inventors from around the world are coming up with ways to quell environmental concerns and to cash in on the burgeoning fish farming industry, which is growing at a worldwide rate of 10 percent each year.  A Turkish company called Denizsan Maritime, Inc., for example, is converting a 20,000 ton freighter into a computerized, integrated fish farm/factory to produce finished products at sea.  The vessel will resolve problems like storm damage to cages or tanks and quell concerns about pollution and interactions with wild fish.According to the Turkish Daily News, eleven production tanks will each hold about 30 feet of water and have no links to the sea or other tank. The tanks will have the capacity to farm seven different types of fish with production pegged at nearly 800,000 pounds per month. The fish factory will sail the open seas in international waters, and discharge its waste in a “computerized and environmentally friendly way,” said the article.When the fish grow to about eight pounds, they’ll be transferred via special pumps to a production area where they will be anesthetized, cleaned, packaged and frozen. The unused parts will be used to produce omega three oils and animal feeds. The ship will begin by producing “crops” of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. It expects to be out on international waters within a year.Meanwhile, Alaska fishermen and lawmakers say they will fight any offshore fish farms in its offshore waters. Last month Sen. Lisa Murkowski proposed blocking aquaculture in federal waters until Congress can study how it might affect Alaska’s wild salmon, halibut, sablefish and crab.“We oppose fish farms anytime, anywhere, any place. Inshore. Offshore. Period,” said Bobby Thorstenson, president of United Fishermen of Alaska.Seafood ice creamIce cream with seafood chunks has become popular in Japan, where the Kagawa Fishery Cooperative has been selling it for nearly ten years. It’s available in six flavors – yellowtail flounder, baby sardine, seaweed, octopus, crab and shrimp.According to the Japan Times, the makers have developed a way to remove as much of the fishy smell as possible, while keeping the delicious flavors. Although some tend to think of it as a joke product, the sellers take their ice cream very seriously. They said they developed the product because more children and young women are shifting away from a healthful fish diet, and seafood ice cream is one way to draw them back. The ice cream is currently being sold at some airports, highway parking lots and resorts.  The  co-op also sells its ice cream by mail.People in Taiwan have also gotten a taste for the seafood confection. For one dollar a scoop, they can select from thirteen flavors- including strawberry tuna, wasabi cuttlefish and pineapple shrimp. The savory ice cream, which comes in stark colors like orange, green and black, is topped with sprinkles of dried fish, roe or chopped squid.The novel dessert, sold under the brand name ‘Doctor Ice,’ was created three years ago by a woman named Liny Hsueh. She is expanding to a second outlet and adding scallops as the newest flavor to her seafood ice cream line up.  Codfish creamsicles or surimi ice cream sandwiches anyone??<COL>global changes warming up<COL>2007-03-21<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/11/salmon-prices-climb/<COL>Salmon prices climbLaine WelchAlaska salmon fishermen received higher prices for the 2006 season for all species but sockeye, and the preliminary values are likely to climb higher.Figures just released by state fishery managers show that the 2006 statewide salmon harvest totaled 141.5 million fish. That ranks as the 15th-largest catch on record since Alaska became a state 47 years ago. The preliminary value is $308.864 million, compared to $334 million for last year’s record harvest of 221 million salmon.Average dock prices this year for chinook salmon increased to $2.77 a pound, up from $2.23 last year. Coho prices averaged 99 cents a pound, an increase from 75 cents in 2005. Chum salmon prices increased each year by five cents, a 19 percent increase. For pinks, the price crept up to 13 cents a pound, an increase of one penny from last year. The statewide average price for sockeye of 67 cents is seven cents less than last season. That’s due primarily to a drop of a nickel a pound at Bristol Bay, which by far provides most of the state’s sockeye catch – nearly 29 million pounds this year compared to about 12 million pounds from elsewhere in Alaska.“Anytime you have an average price for a particular species, it can be deceptive. If you end up with a larger share of the fish being caught where the price was lower, it will contribute to the statewide price going down. But that can be deceptive,” said University of Alaska fisheries economist Gunnar Knapp.On a brighter note, Norton Sound had its best commercial coho harvest ever at 131,000. Healthy chum runs also continued in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.“In fact, if there were more buyers for chum salmon from that region, our statewide harvest would’ve been much higher. There were hundreds of thousands of fish there that could have been harvested but were not, due to no markets,” said ADF&G deputy commissioner Geron Bruce. The statewide chum salmon harvest of 21.4 million fish ranks as the second best of all time in both numbers of fish and in the dockside value of $56.3 million.Here are some comparative catch values (in millions of dollars) for the 2006/2005 salmon fisheries per region:2006          2005Southeast AK                      $95,229      $85,444Prince William Sound         $51, 046      $55,118Cook Inlet                           $15, 204      $33,585Bristol Bay                          $93,935       $96,515Kodiak                                $25,770       $27,353Chignik                               $5,036         $5,545AK Peninsula                      $17,190       $26,371Kuskokwim                         $1,142         $1,208Yukon                                 $3,694         $2,551Norton Sound                      $390           $236Kotzebue                             $228           $125Preliminary salmon prices do not include bonuses or other post-season adjustments.

Why so far away from the proposed mine site?“Of the more than 1,800 drift net permits in the Bristol Bay fishery, 1,100 are held by non-residents of Alaska. That means we really have a problem with local participation in the fishery,” said Trefon Angasan, an outreach coordinator for Northern Dynasty.Angasan, who now lives in Anchorage, is a lifelong Native rights advocate and former state Fish Board member. He claims his clan goes back 10,000 years in the Bristol Bay region, and his family currently holds more than 50 local salmon permits. Angasan calls himself a “connector between Northern Dynasty and the people.”“I’ve taken a lot of heat for that, but I think it is a necessary step to be sure that at least what was being said within the inner circles is conveyed to the local people,” he explained. “They really haven’t shown me they can do it safely yet. Until they do, I am going to withhold my comments and keep an open mind at least until they are finished with their permit applications.”The fisheries meeting, which coincides with the start of the Pacific Marine Expo, will feature updates on the Pebble project by Northern Dynasty chief of operations Bruce Jenkins, and a presentation by fisheries biologist Jim Buell. It is set for Nov. 15 from 2-5pm at the Leif Erikson Building in Seattle.

The plan addresses program goals and strategies, budget and staffing requirements, outcomes, benefits and challenges.The aquaculture effort focuses on creating more U.S. products to meet the growing demand for seafood, and to reduce dependence on imports. Currently, more than 70 percent of the seafood Americans eat is imported, and 40 percent of that is farmed. Federal analyses show domestic aquaculture production could be increased by more than two billion pounds per year by 2025 from fish, crustaceans and mollusks, resulting in 75 thousand jobs annually. Various algae and seaweeds for nutritional products are also included in the program.While much of the attention has been focused on offshore fish farms, meaning from three to 200 miles from shore, the 10 year plan also includes coastal aquaculture, research and development of feeds, hatchery techniques, biomedical products and stock enhancement programs.Ten species have so far been identified as suitable candidates for aquaculture, including cod, halibut, sablefish and tuna. If legislative mandates and funding are provided by Congress, NOAA Fisheries will begin next year to establish permitting systems. Partnering with states and stakeholders, the feds will then create up to 20 new offshore farms, as well as five onshore hatcheries to stock the fish sites. Get more information on the interim final version of the 10 year aquaculture plan at www.aquaculture.noaa.gov . Deadline to comment is Nov. 30.Tanner numbers tank – Kodiak’s Tanner crab harvest will take a big dip next year to 800 thousand   pounds, down from 2.1 million pounds for the 2006 season. Likewise, the catch for the western district of the South Peninsula will decrease from 290 thousand to 200 thousand pounds, and there will be no fishery at Chignik.For the past few years crabbers have been concentrating on a single year class of bairdi Tanners that entered the fishery in 2001, and it is about tapped out.“The fishery is basically prosecuting the tail end of that same year class,  and we haven’t had a similar pulse of recruitment following immediately behind it to keep the harvests as high as they’ve been in the past couple of years,” said state crab biologist Nick Sagalkin of Kodiak.Surveys indicate that the outlook for the near future is very encouraging. Large numbers of smaller crab appear to be recruiting into the fishery, in areas that are far more wide spread.  “Around Kodiak, it looks very strong on the east side and in southeast sections, as well as good signs on the west side which we didn’t see in 2001. There are also signs of strong recruitment in Chignik and the western peninsula. So it looks very promising for future fisheries, probably three years down the road,” Sagalkin said.Until then, however, Tanner crab harvests are likely to remain at lower levels. “I would guess that the levels will be similar or perhaps a bit lower because we will be in a bit of a valley for a year or two until this pulse of juvenile crab recruits into the fishery,” he added.Bairdi Tanner crab, which weigh between 2.2 – 2.5 pounds, are the larger cousin of opilio Tanners, more commonly known as snow crab. Earlier this year a Kodiak fleet of 68 boats received $1.40 a pound for their Tanner crab, making the fishery worth nearly $3 million at the docks. The fishery opens in mid-January.On a related note: Tanner crab is spelled with a capitol T and here’s why: the crab was discovered by and named after Lieutenant Zera Luther Tanner, commander of the research vessel Albatross, which explored Alaska waters from 1888 to 1893.Expo Extraordinaire – Pacific Marine Expo, one of the industry’s most popular trade shows,  celebrates its 40th year this week in Seattle. Along with hundreds of fishing related goods and services, Expo always includes top notch forums. This year’s keynote features “Deadliest Catch” stars Sig and Edgar Hanson from the F/V Northwestern. Also in the line up: trends in rationalization programs around the country, pros and cons of eco-labels, expanding Alaska’s seafood “portfolio’ beyond salmon, and reps from the newly formed Commercial Fishermen of America will discuss the benefits of a national organization for harvesters and communities.On a lighter side, Expo will again crown the Fisherman of the Year, a cash winning competition that includes net mending, rope splicing and blindfolded knot tying. This year the event will also launch a new contest – the Simrad trawl sensor egg toss.“It’s an event that Simrad started in Norway to demonstrate the durability of their trawl egg,” explained Jerry Fraser, editor of National Fisherman magazine, sponsor of Expo. “We have a 100 foot by seven foot wide sort of bowling alley and anyone who is feeling rugged is invited to see how far they can throw the trawl egg. It weighs several pounds and I think the world record is about 80 feet,” Fraser added.Expo also will feature a bash to benefit the Seattle Fishermen’s Memorial Scholarship Fund, and National Fisherman will match all donations.  Pacific Marine Expo takes place Nov. 16-18 at the Qwest Center in Seattle. Get more info at www.pacificmarineexpo.com .Fish comment s- Nov. 17 is the deadline to comment on Proposal 121– which would create a fish refuge in headwaters of Bristol Bay. The waters are adjacent to the site of the proposed Pebble Mine, which would be the largest open pit gold and copper mine in North America. The refuge, a first of its kind for Alaska, would protect fish habitat and allow for continuing uses of commercial, sport and subsistence fishing.“The refuge can’t in and of itself stop Pebble Mine, but it can hold the Canadian developers more accountable to live up to their promises of no net loss of fish. It protects the habitat and says the fish come first,” said George Matz of Homer who put forth Proposal 121.Mail written comments to Board of Fisheries Comments, ADF&G, P.O.

The state Board of Fisheries will address Proposal 121 during its Dec. 4-12 meeting in Dillingham.Fish cash – American Seafoods Company is again accepting applications for its community grant program. The company awards $75,000 each year to worthy projects throughout rural Alaska. Since 1997, American Seafoods Company has granted more than $600,000 to Alaska organizations and programs.In December ASC’s Community Advisory board will donate a total of $30,000 to various Alaskan projects that tackle issues such as hunger, housing, safety, education, research, natural resources and cultural activities.

Biologists with the International Pacific Halibut Commission are recommending a 2007 coast-wide catch of 66.56 half million pounds, which includes California, Oregon, Washington, B.C. and Alaska. That’s down from a catch limit of 69.86 million pounds this year.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the halibut harvest, and the state could see an overall increase to nearly 56 million pounds, up about a half million from 2006.Preliminary numbers show slight increases for all regions in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea – except for Southeast. Biologists are recommending a halibut catch of seven and a half million pounds for the Southeast region, a drop of three million pounds from this year.The IPHC based its numbers on a new model after recoveries of tagged halibut showed a greater movement of fish among regulatory areas than previously thought. Accordingly, the managers developed a coast-wide assessment based on a single stock, rather than assessments for each of eight regions. The result was some substantial changes in catch rates.The catch recommendations, along with other halibut issues, will be considered by the IPHC at its annual meeting set for Jan. 16-19 in Victoria, British Columbia. The catch limits may be updated, but they are not expected to change significantly, the Commission said.  The IPHC will take public comments on the catch recommendations through Dec. 31.  The fishery will open most likely in early March and last through mid-November.

We could move somewhere warmer, but we stay here and even fantasize about going to someplace colder and whiter—the Antarctic.I’m vicariously living my fantasy by following the story of the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea, an icebreaker that departed for the southern continent Nov. 18. Its mission: to boldly go where few have gone before….sorry, I couldn’t resist. Actually the Polar Sea is leading two other ships in an annual trek to refuel and replenish McMurdo Station, the primary U.S. science and logistic hub for Antarctic research efforts.The ship was in Alaska this past summer, stopping in Kodiak for several days in August. A major overhaul necessitated an arctic shake-down tour before its five-month mission at the southern end of the planet. They also performed scientific research and arctic training, which is part and parcel of what the ice breaker is designed to do.The Polar Sea’s skipper is Capt. Bruce Toney, who’s been to Antarctica several times on both the Sea and its sister ship the Polar Star. The Star is parked at a dock in Seattle in what’s called “caretaker status,” which is another way of say that this past June the ship was put into semi-retirement while the Coast Guard figures out what to do with the old, outdated ship.“In Antarctica our current primary mission is to create a channel through the fast ice to the large scientific station at McMurdp so that two large supply ships—one container ship and one oil tanker—can do the once-a-year re-supply of that station,” said Toney during his visit to Kodiak.“They deliver anywhere from 6 to 8 million gallons of diesel fuel and jet fuel, and 720 20-foot containers. It’s a self-un-loading container ship with its own cranes. We create that channel and we escort them, possibly tow them part of the way.”The Coast Guard ship also does tug duty as needed, towing the re-supply ships off the pier or out of frozen ice as need.“Our main job is to get them in there and out,” says Toney.Not an easy task given that the ice edge can extend as far as 80 nautical miles from McMurdo station. That’s a lot of ice to break if it’s frozen tight. Of course, our winter is their summer, so they are moving from spring to summer right now with ever increasing hours of daylight and warmer temperatures. Surely an advantage if only slight.Escort and delivery service may be the main job of the Polar Sea, but the Antarctic run, known officially as “Operation Deep Freeze,” has some interesting collateral duties.“We do some science on a not-to-interfere basis. It’s a secondary mission, but we may have a few scientists along to take some samples or count animal populations,” said Toney.Such help may include anything from getting DNA samples from orcas to tagging penguins. And of course, there’s all that sightseeing. Towering blue ice and endless white landscapes…The Polar Sea keeps its web page current while underway. Follow the trip south yourself by going to the ship’s web page www.uscg.mil/pacarea/polarsea/home.htm  and clicking on “Current News.”FISH NEWSThere’s been a lot of chatter in fish press this past week about fish farming. Alaskans, who are staunchly opposed, call it fish farming. The Outside press are more and more referring to it as aquaculture, which technically it is. The difference is the picture the public draws in its mind when the subject is mentioned. Fish farming sounds down and dirty, aquaculture sounds new and improved. That’s a big difference in terms of how the product will be received by the public.A Seattle Times article even praised the glories of farm raised tilapia as a gourmet faire that is sold at Costco. Greg Atkinson wrote about how “eco-friendly” tilapia is, noting that salmon are carnivorous and “present sustainability challenges because every pound of fish raised in captivity requires about two pounds of feed from wild fish.”I’ve always heard the necessary poundage was about double that, but the interesting part followed in which Atkinson makes a point that tilapia can be raised on grain. What he fails to mention is that most tilapia farms feed their fish recycled grain—in the form of chicken poop.Picture that next time you eat a tilapia.Maggie Wall is an award-winning journalist based in Kodiak. Laine Welch will be back next week.<COL>The Polar Sea travels south<COL>2006-11-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/12/crabbers-improve-grades/<COL>Crabbers improve gradesBy Laine WelchCrabbers are pulling up their last pots as the red king crab fishery at Bristol Bay draws to a close. By all accounts, the industry deserves high praise for the way in which participants worked together this season to stop the unsavory practice of high grading, or sorting out less valuable crabs with darkened or barnacle covered shells.High grading dominated the fishery last year when nearly 700,000 legal sized “dirty” crabs (about 4 million pounds) were tossed overboard by crabbers being squeezed by falling wholesale prices and rising fuel costs. Assuming that 20 percent of the discarded crabs died, managers responded by deducting nearly 4.6 percent off the top of this year’s catch quota, dropping it to approximately 14 million pounds.Crabbers signed pledges to do better this year and by all accounts, they did.“We’re still gathering observer data, but it appears that high grading has not been a problem,” said Denby Lloyd, director of the state commercial fisheries division. He said he believes there are several reasons for the turn around.“Industry is on its best behavior after what happened last year. Also, the abundance of old shell crab is far less than last year. And the fact that most processors are paying a single price for all crab has also reduced discards. The combined effect has resulted in some good retention rates,” Lloyd said.The number of old shell crabs was estimated at just 16 percent of the legal male population this season compared to about 42 percent last year, according to Regional Management Biologist Forrest Bowers at the state Dept. of Fish and Game office in Dutch Harbor.“Speaking with observers and vessel operators, I didn’t hear any reports of wide spread discarding like I did at this time last year.  We also had a good effort by the industry prior to the season to come up with a voluntary plan to retain all the legal males they caught,” Bowers added.Ultimately, the crab fleet and processors deserve the credit, said Steve Minor, chairman of the Pacific Northwest Crab Industry Advisory Committee.“I can’t think of any other instance where an industry has been able to move so quickly from one season to the next to impose voluntary measures — from sharing  information about crab grounds to avoid to nearly 100 percent agreement on full retention. And one of the most important things, nearly all processors agreed on establishing a single price to remove the economic incentives for high grading,” Minor said.He also credited the new quota share management plan for “providing the tools to better manage the fishery, which allowed for the coordinated response from industry to eliminate this problem.”A fleet of 81 vessels participated in the Bering Sea king crab fishery, which opened on Oct. 15. Average dock prices ranged from $3 – $3.50 per pound, down $1 from last year. Catch rates were about 33 crabs per pot, the highest since the 1980s. Denby Lloyd said surveys indicate good recruitment of younger crab coming into the fishery.ASMI takes aim at organic––A nation-wide survey aims to find out how much value consumers place on the term “organic” when they’re making seafood purchases, and if it draws shoppers away from wild salmon.“The term ‘organic’ can be applied to some farmed salmon, but not to wild fish. It’s been a galloping segment of the retail grocery market for quite some time and that’s why so many people have been trying to capitalize on it. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for something labeled organic. Our purpose is to find out what attributes they associate with the word,” said Laura Fleming, communications director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.The consumer responses will help ASMI refine its messages to targeted customers as it expands into more national advertising venues, including magazines and cable television’s popular Food Network.“We want to make sure we are striking deep into the hearts and minds of the consumers who buy Alaska seafood. Those are people who are a little better educated and well healed, and have more disposable income. It’s the 34 to 54 age group and skewed toward females because women are still doing more of the buying,” Fleming explained.She added that ASMI will stick with its key messages of wild, natural and sustainable seafood for which customers are also willing to pay a premium.“Alaska seafood has a lot of equity out there. The most recent national surveys show it is ranked second among the most popular food brands on the menus of the top 500 restaurant chains in the country,” Fleming said.Results of the “organic” consumer survey will be unveiled in February.Jellyfish cookies––As part of an ongoing battle against invading swarms of giant jellyfish, students from Obama Fisheries High School in Japan’s Fukui prefecture have developed a method for converting the creatures into a powder. A local company  uses the ingredient to make souvenir cookies, which are said to have a “superbly textured sweetness nicely complemented by the bitter, salty flavor of jellyfish.”According to the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, huge Echizen kurage (Nomura’s jellyfish) invade the Sea of Japan each autmun, seriously disrupting fishing operations. The giant jellyfish can grow up to 6 feet wide and weigh up to 450 pounds each.

Comfish is asking for a $3.7 million-dollar increase from the state’s general fund, putting the division’s overall operating costs at about $61 million. That increase, coupled with the general fund boost of nearly $2.5 million approved by the legislature for FY 06, are the most significant increases the division has seen since 1985. Much of the budget increase is earmarked to cover salary increases and retirement. The Comfish division employs more than 300 full-time and 500 seasonal workers.In the annual overview report under “key accomplishments,” Director Denby Lloyd said the dockside value of Alaska’s seafood landings rose for the third consecutive year in 2005 to nearly $1.3 billion — the highest value since 1999, and the second-highest in the past ten years.For Alaska salmon, large harvests and a modest increase in prices boosted the value by 85 percent last year from the low point in 2002. But salmon prices are totally out-of-step with inflation — Lloyd points out that the average statewide salmon price in 1984 was 77 cents a pound; in 2004, it was 60 cents. At the same time, the consumer price index increased 78 percent, making the real price per pound for Alaska sockeye salmon in 2004 just 13 cents in constant dollars. That makes the health of the salmon industry very dependent on continued high production, the budget report says.The Comfish division is having difficulties attracting new staff and retaining existing ones.  Director Lloyd is requesting $300,000 toward an ongoing program to recruit young Alaskans to careers in the commercial fisheries division.Other notable items in the Comfish overview: The dockside value of Alaska salmon in 2005 was $302.7 million, up from $272 in 2004. Groundfish landings rang in at $660 million in 2005, up from $564.7. Shellfish was worth $147.8 million at the Alaska docks in 2005, down from $169.59 in 2004.Employment stats showed fewer vessel licenses at 9,969 in ’05 compared to 13,618 in 2004. Crewmember licenses dropped slightly to 18,136 from 18,648 in 2004.Young Fishermen’s’ Summit – Fishermen who are under 40 or who have been in the fishing business for less than five years will want to participate in a Young Fishermen’s Summit next month in Anchorage.“Young fishermen face many obstacles not encountered by their predecessors. It’s a lot more complicated now,” said Sunny Rice, a Sea Grant Marine Advisory Agent at Petersburg, and an organizer of the event.  “One thing is the incredible debt they have to look at as they start buying a permit and vessel. That’s something the other generation didn’t have to deal with.”The Summit comes at a time when many Alaskans are striving to keep more fishing permits in coastal communities near the fishing grounds.  A primary goal will be to provide young fishermen with the tools that can help them run their fishing operations from a business perspective.The summit will also focus on the role Alaska seafood plays in a greatly expanded global marketplace.  Rice says if fishermen plan to be in the business for the long haul, it’s important for them to understand and be involved in the regulatory process.“They need to get a basic understanding of what the state and federal regulatory processes are and how they can get involved, and the best ways to present themselves and their issues when dealing with these various boards and commissions,” Rice said.Many Alaska communities and fishing groups are sponsoring young fishermen to attend the Young Fishermen’s Summit, Jan. 25 and 26 at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage.

The popular list is usually released in November by the federal government, along with per capita seafood consumption figures for the previous year. According to John Boreman of NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology, the problem stems from data collection glitches in the northeast where electronic reporting systems are being upgraded. Boreman told Intrafish the seafood stats for 2005 won’t be available until early next year.The latest per capita figures from 2004 showed that each American ate 16.6 pounds of seafood with the favorites remaining shrimp, canned tuna, salmon and pollock.Salmon is one of America’s most popular seafoods, but that appetite is still being fed mostly by imported farmed fish. Federal reports show imports of farmed salmon to the United States topped $1.2 billion in the first 10 months of 2006, an increase of 33 percent. Chile is by far the largest supplier of farmed salmon to the United States, followed by Norway.More fish at school – Alaska universities have long offered many excellent courses in fisheries sciences. That will soon expand to a degree program in fisheries business and management. The University of Alaska/School of Fisheries and Ocean Science has received a $5 million award from the Rasmuson Foundation to “redesign and reinvigorate” its undergraduate fisheries program.In addition to elevating the existing Bachelor of Science degree, key elements of this effort include the creation of both a new Bachelor of Arts and a Minor degree in fisheries to broadly prepare students to participate in the fishing industry.“It is important that the University of Alaska’s program grows our own experts who can step up both to help shape public policy and meet the industry’s ongoing need for qualified leadership,” Board Chairman Ed Rasmuson said in a press release, adding that: “Over the next few years the school will create an academic program of national prominence to train Alaskans to manage the state’s fisheries.”<COL>Fishermen hoping for boost<COL>2006-12-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2006/12/crab-markets-feel-pinch/<COL>Crab markets feel pinchWith almost no snow crab carry-overs in the nation’s freezers and crimped catch quotas in competing countries, Bering Sea crabbers are hoping for a bigger paycheck for Alaska’s largest crab fishery.The 2007 season will be in full swing by mid-January, and while most crab markets are feeling the pinch of over supply, that’s not the case for snow crab.“We would like to see an advance price of $1.60,” said Greg White, a negotiator for the Inter-Cooperative Exchange, crab harvesters who hold about 70 percent of the Bering Sea king and snow crab quota shares. “We think that’s supportable in the current market environment.”The average price for Alaska snow crab last season was just 84 cents a pound, settling out at $1.15 to $1.19 after post-season adjustments.Urner Barry, which since 1858 has tracked U.S. food products, reported in late November that inventories are “close to being sold out and demand is extremely active” for Canadian product. Canada is the world’s largest snow crab producer, delivering close to 195 million pounds this year into mostly U.S. markets.Canada’s crab quotas are on a downward spiral, as are Russia’s, where catches have dropped to a still hefty 110 million pounds. Alaska is a bit player in comparison, producing about 37 million pounds of snow crab in the coming year, just 10 percent of world supply.But Bering Sea crabbers can get the jump on their competition, said Ken Talley, editor of Seafood Trends newsletter.“One of the keys of success for Alaska snow crab, for processors and fishermen, will be getting the crab harvested and into the market as quickly as possible. That’s the only way for Alaska production to take advantage of the vacuum in supply. When Canadian snow crab hits the market in late April, it will set the pace and Alaska will only follow along,” Talley said.“We feel like we are at the 50 yard line and the nearest defensive player is about 30 yards behind us, and all we’ve got to do is run to the end zone. Last year the processors didn’t make money and neither did the harvesters. It’s time to turn that around for us both,” said Greg White.The 2006 Bering Sea snow crab catch of 40 million pounds was valued at $31 million at the docks.Surimi by any other name….The Alaska pollock industry is celebrating a name change for surimi –the popular crab, lobster or shrimp flavored seafood made from whitefish that is served in seafood salads and at sushi bars. The FDA is now allowing the word “imitation” to be dropped from surimi product labels, a requirement since the product was introduced to the United States in the 1970s.The imitation term creates a negative perception with consumers, said Rick Muir of the group Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers, or GAPP.“Imitation is not something that people get all warm and fuzzy about. So we were really looking forward to getting out a name that wouldn’t deceive the public but would be more appealing and appetizing,” Muir said.The Alaska pollock industry and the National Fisheries Institute have been lobbying Congress for a decade to allow the new description. Producers hope the new labeling will prompt consumers to take another look at surimi products, whose sales have lagged since the mid 1990s.There are eight United States surimi companies and 10 plants, mostly in Alaska, Washington and Oregon. The industry produces roughly 185 million pounds of surimi each year valued at $300 million.Surimi is called by its Japanese name, which means ground meat. It dates back to the 12th century when Japanese fishermen discovered minced and salted fish lasted longer.Seward and sport fish -   A study getting underway by the Alaska Sea Life Center will analyze the economic impact of sport caught salmon to Seward’s economy, and compare the benefits to the high costs of salmon enhancement and restoration programs.“We have paid up to 50 cents per smolt for these fish that are then released. The return of those animals is fairly low, so the actual cost of the investment in those fish is pretty high,” said center husbandry director Lee Kellar.The Seward study will focus primarily on the importance of coho and chinook salmon to the local sport fishery. “We believe it’s fairly apparent that these fish bring a lot of value to our community, but we don’t have a figure and we don’t know the full scope of it,” Kellar said.  He added that the region’s local chinook runs are under utilized and the study might provide more direction for that fishery.“We hope to hear from folks who own hardware stores and restaurants and hotels and B&B’s and every other type of business, in addition to the direct beneficiaries of the sport fishing industry. That will give us a more accurate representation of the real values and benefits of the sport fishery to the Seward community,” Kellar said.Surveys and interviews are being conducted by the McDowell Group with funding from ADF&G’s Sustainable Salmon Fund.

As “farmers of the sea,” they can be included in various programs under the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture’s Farm Bill, The bill is revised every five years and policies established in this latest version will last through 2012. With a budget of nearly $95 billion the USDA  is the nation’s premier food agency, and as the many measures in the Farm Bill are tweaked this year by Congress, fishermen need to make sure their ideas and needs are included.“Fishermen need to have parity with fish farmers in any kind of support or other programs,” said Mark Vinsel, executive director of the United Fishermen of Alaska. “Another key component is Country of Origin Labeling of wild and farmed fish. There may be efforts to undermine that and we can’t have any backsliding on that. We would also like to see all product forms covered by COOL, especially canned salmon.”Fishermen can, for example, push for more U.S. seafood to be included in the nation’s school lunch program. Under the Farm Bill, they can also apply for low cost loans to help improve their business or modernize equipment, and other programs available to our nation’s farmers.“These include such things as marketing programs, loan deficiency payments, cooperative marketing associations. There are a number of things we’ve discussed with various fishing groups and the state of Alaska as far as more inclusion of fishermen into USDA programs,” said Chad Padgett, director of the Farm Service Agency in Palmer.UFA’s Vinsel pointed out the average age of Alaska fishermen today is just over 50; for family farmers it’s closer to 65.“That’s alarming for the food production industry. We need to look for ways to make producing foods a viable career option for the next generation. That’s an important part of the farm bill and farmers are addressing it very aggressively. We hope everything that is done to benefit farmers also applies to fishermen,” he said.Vinsel added that when it comes to making things happen in Washington, D.C.,  “it is critical for non-resident Alaska fishermen to contact their Congressional representatives, especially if they are members of the farm committee.”Get more information at www.usda.gov/farm bill, from UFA in Juneau, or call the Farm Service office at 761-7738.Fishing top job for danger – Those who make their living from the sea still top the list of the most dangerous jobs, especially crabbers. According to the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48 fishing-related deaths occurred nationwide in 2005. Based on the relatively small number of commercial fishermen, that puts the fatality rate at 118 per 100,000 – or about one of every 5,400 workers.While the annual on the job death rate for fishermen is still quite high, it has declined more than 50 percent since 1990. The decrease is especially notable in Alaska, said Jerry Dzugan, director of the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA).“Alaska has had the biggest improvement in fishing safety than any other place in the country. We’ve gone down from almost 40 fatalities a year in the early 1980s to an average of about 11 in the past five years. So that’s a huge drop,” Dzugan said.Falling overboard is the No. 1 way that most fishermen meet their maker. Dzugan said simply wearing personal flotation devices could literally save the day.“It doesn’t make the big headlines, like when a boat goes down with all hands. But these “one bys” really add up,” Dzugan said.The Labor Bureau puts the average take-home salary for fishermen at $29,000 per year.Logging ranks second for job fatalities at about 93 per year (average salary $31,290). Next is aircraft pilots at 66.9 deaths, including mostly bush pilots, air taxis and crop dusters. (Salary: $135,040)Alaska has a flying fatality rate that is four times higher than elsewhere in the nation, and Alaska pilots have a one in eight chance of dying during a 30-year career. Most fatal crashes in Alaska come from losing visibility and flying into mountains.Also making the most dangerous jobs list were iron and steelworkers (55.6 deaths/salary $43,540): trash collectors (43.8 deaths/salary $30,160); farmers and ranchers (41.1 deaths/salary $39,720): , electric power line workers (32.7 deaths/salary $49,200); truck drivers (29.1 deaths/$35,460 for heavy or tractor trailer drivers) and agricultural workers (23.2 deaths/salary $24,140.)Veggie trawlers — The first vegetable oil powered trawler is undergoing test trials in the North Sea. The diesel engine aboard the “Jubilee Quest” has been converted to run on a mix of the more earth friendly fuel. The vessel is performing the same as with diesel, the skipper told the BBC “Working Lunch” program.The Jubilee Quest runs on a dual fuel system that starts on diesel, switches over to vegetable oil when the engine has warmed up, then reverts to diesel again before switching off.Environmental benefits of using biofuel on fishing vessels would be vast. The BBC said a large diesel-powered trawler on a 10-day trip emits 37 tons of carbon emissions. That compares to a family car, which emits about two tons in a year.Also in the UK – it was “all aboard” the veggie train last week as the first passenger train fueled by 20 percent of biodiesel took to the tracks.Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Trains, said after test trials the whole train line may be converted to run on the bio-blend.Branson, who also owns Virgin Airline, is planning a test flight with one of his passenger aircraft using biofuel. The billionaire has committed to spending all the profits from his airline and rail business to combat global warming.Britain currently gives a tax break to cars using veg oil fuel blends. Germany and Ireland have gone further with complete duty exemptions on some biofuels for road use. Similar tax breaks are likely to be applied soon to fishing boats and other transportation sectors.Here’s an interesting fact: the internal combustion engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel of France in 1898. Diesel’s first engines were built to run on peanut oil for the developing world, which had no petrochemicals industry. So converting back to veggie oil fuels would be going back to what the designer intended.   Find out more about vegetable oil as vehicle fuel at http://www.ravenfamily.org/andyg/vegoil.htm<COL>Alaska’s fishermen gain new title<COL>2007-06-20<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/01/halibut-harvesting-limits/<COL>Halibut harvesting limitsHalibut catches in Southeast could drop by 29 percent next year, while harvesters in other regions might enjoy a bit of a boost. Biologists with the International Pacific Halibut Commission are recommending a 2007 coast-wide catch of 66.56 half million pounds, which includes California, Oregon, Washington, B.C. and Alaska. That’s down from a catch limit of 69.86 million pounds this year.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the halibut harvest, and the state could see an overall increase to nearly 56 million pounds, up about a half million from 2006.Preliminary numbers show slight increases for all regions in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea – except for Southeast. Biologists are recommending a halibut catch of seven and a half million pounds for the Southeast region, a drop of three million pounds from this year.The IPHC based its numbers on a new model after recoveries of tagged halibut showed a greater movement of fish among regulatory areas than previously thought. Accordingly, the managers developed a coast-wide assessment based on a single stock, rather than assessments for each of eight regions. The result was some substantial changes in catch rates.The catch recommendations, along with other halibut issues, will be considered by the IPHC at its annual meeting set for Jan.16-19 in Victoria, British Columbia. The catch limits may be updated, but they are not expected to change significantly, the Commission said.  The IPHC will take public comments on the catch recommendations through December 31st.  The fishery will open most likely in early March and last through mid-November. Below are the Alasks catch recommendations in millions of pounds:Catch Limit   Rec.

The “cost recovery” fee is capped at three percent of the value of the landed catches.The bills are in the mail to roughly 2,500 harvesters – and good news – they will pay only one percent this year, down from 1.6 percent in 2005.  The reduced fee stemmed from lower agency costs and higher fish prices, according to Tracy Buck, permit operations manager at the Restricted Access Management Division of NOAA Fisheries in Juneau.”We had to redirect a lot of staff to get the crab rationalization permits out the door and other things dealing with that new fishery,” Buck explained.As for Alaska halibut and sablefish prices, they reached an all time high. “The average price for halibut during 2006 was $3.71 a pound, up about 70 cents from the prior year and up almost a dollar from 2004. For sablefish, the average price was $2.45 a pound, up about 35 cents from 2005,” Buck said.The value of the 2006 halibut fishery topped $193 million at the docks, up $25 million from 2005. For sablefish, the dockside value topped $75 million, up $5 million from last year.    Deadline for fishermen to pay the fee to the feds is January 31st.Set netters say no to Bristol Bay RSDA – Bristol Bay set netters voted not to participate in a new Regional Seafood Development Association, or RSDA.  A total of 446 of the roughly 980 set net permit holders voted in a recent election, and 305 said no. By state law, 30 percent of a gear group must vote and a majority prevails.Earlier this year, a majority of Bristol Bay’s nearly 2,800 drift net fleet cast votes in support of an RSDA, which will be funded by a one percent tax on their salmon catches. Tax revenues were collected on the drift fleet this summer and roughly $800,000 will be available to the RSDA next year.The money is collected by the state and then appropriated back to the associations. It can be used to market and promote the region’s seafood, conduct research or product development or improve infrastructure.  The nay vote by set netters means those salmon fishermen will have no voice in the projects and programs developed by a soon to be elected board of directors.”They were not convinced about the economic benefits to pay the tax,” said set netter and interim RSDA board member Cecil Ranney. “We got a big bogged down talking about providing ice and improving quality for the past few years, but the price has remained stagnant. We probably should have emphasized developing more markets and promotions.”“We might revisit it after we see how things go with the drifters. And any promotions will benefit us all,” Ranney said, adding that he believes a set netter should have a seat at the RSDA table to stay informed.  “We have never had an area wide organization that included all salmon fishermen, and that would be a real positive thing.”State managers project the 2007 sockeye salmon harvest at 26.3 million reds, just slightly below this year’s projection. The catch came in higher than expected with fishermen delivering nearly 29 million sockeyes, valued at $91 million. Bristol Bay produces nearly one third of Alaska’s total salmon harvest each year, and is the state’s largest salmon fishery.<COL>Halibut harvesting limits<COL>2007-01-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/01/fishing-season-highlights/<COL>Fishing season highlightsCommercial fishing in Alaska remains a vibrant industry that is the envy of other countries around the world. Managers and industry stakeholders are protective stewards of Alaska’s robust marine resources — especially while the fisheries are being retooled to conform to the tough realities of changing times.Here is a sampler of Alaska seafood industry highlights from 2006, in no particular order or priority, followed by my annual picks of top fish stories.Alaska halibut prices topped $4 per pound in major ports during the entire eight-month season, making the fishery worth nearly $195 million at the docks. The halibut market is expected to remain hot in 2007.The Alaska salmon harvest of 141.5 million was valued at $309 million. It marked the first time in a decade that back-to-back salmon harvests topped $300 million.Pink salmon continued its shift from low value cans into the more lucrative frozen market. Alaska processors put in more fillet lines for all salmon species, especially sockeye.Managers lopped nearly five percent off the top of the Bering Sea king crab quota due to high discard rates. Crabbers signed pledges to do better for the 2006 season, and by all accounts, they did.Nearly 80 percent of Americans said they are aware that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega 3s from fish were credited with calming hyperactive kids, reducing Alzheimer’s Disease, slowing cancer growth, improving babies’ brain and eyesight development and reducing wrinkles. Fish oil capsules became the fastest growing nutritional supplement in the market.Oceanographers predicted a 150 percent increase in ocean acidity by the end of this century. That has the skeletons of corals, crabs and snails dissolving due to global emissions of carbon dioxide caused by the burning of fossil fuels.Marine scientists also claimed some fish stocks will disappear within 40 years — and that snow crab, pollock and other fish stocks would head further north due to global warming changes.Nearly half of America’s 110 million time-crunched households now eat frozen seafood. Nearly half of the fish consumed worldwide are now raised on fish farms.Wild Alaska salmon made it onto the menus of world food aid programs in the form of 1,400 tons of canned pinks, and purchases also expanded to canned keta (chums).The Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation began a project to develop salmon based baby foods. The Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers led a charge to get ‘tasty and appealing’ fish into the nation’s school lunch program.Bristol Bay salmon fishermen voted on a one percent tax on their catches to fund their own Regional Seafood Development Association.Smoked Yukon king salmon from two small companies bested all others at the Symphony of Seafood events in Las Vegas and Anchorage – Boreal Fisheries of St. Mary’s (www.borealfish.com) and Yukon King Seafoods of Marshall, AK (www.yukonking.com).Alaska Sea Grant launched the state’s first crab enhancement project, designed to one-day restore wild king crab stocks around the Pribilof Islands and Kodiak.The “Deadliest Catch” series on the Discovery Channel was rated the top non-sports show on cable television.Pacific halibut and sablefish merited a ‘green’ label by the international Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The label tells customers their purchases come from well managed, fisheries.Wal-Mart pledged to source seafood only from fisheries that are certified by the MSC as being sustainably managed and friendly to the environment. Other mega-corporations in the U.S. and Europe quickly followed suit. Alaska’s largest fisheries: pollock, salmon and halibut boast the MSC label, as does sablefish.‘Sustainable’ was selected as the top word for 2006 by Global Language Monitor.National reports said the health benefits of eating seafood far outweigh any risks from contaminants. Experts rated Alaska pink, coho or chum salmon as No. 1 on a new Kid-Safe food list.The U.S. government launched its ’10 Year Plan for a National Aquaculture Program.’ Cod, halibut, sablefish and tuna are identified as suitable candidates for U.S. aquaculture.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in Alaska’s vibrant and fascinating seafood industry.Best wishes for a safe, healthy and prosperous New Year!<COL>Fishing season highlights<COL>2007-01-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/06/fish-suppliers-make-more/<COL>Fish suppliers make moreby Laine WelchIncreasing worldwide demand combined with higher seafood prices has boosted the bottom line of major suppliers. Industry insiders predict a bright future, saying seafood companies are more efficient, better capitalized and more liquid than five to 10 years ago.According to SeaFood Business’ annual list of North America’s Top 25, major U.S. companies reeled in nearly $12.6 billion in 2006, up about $1.3 billion from the previous year. Trident Seafoods and Oregon-based Pacific Seafood Group were the leaders in the $33 billion total U.S. wholesale seafood business.Only one food conglomerate, Del Monte (owner of StarKist) remained on the Top 25 list, compared to five food giants five years ago: ConAgra, H.J. Heinz, Unilever, George Weston Ltd. and Aurora Foods (now Pinnacle Foods Group).“The private, family-run businesses that have dominated the seafood industry for decades are thriving, while the food conglomerates that jumped into the business years ago have bailed out,” SeaFood Business said.“Most of the successful players have strong access to the resource, and it’s been a long road for them to get to that point,” said industry consultant Scott Etzel.“Seafood doesn’t lend itself well to a neat, tidy balance sheet. It isn’t easy to predict.”Higher seafood prices added to the seafood companies’ financial success, notably Pacific halibut and king salmon. Tight supplies of European whitefish have increased demand for Alaska pollock and cod. A depreciating dollar value also made it less expensive for Europeans to buy U.S. seafood, Etzel said.The health benefits of seafood are also increasing demand worldwide, particularly in the United States, where the growing baby boomer and Hispanic populations are fueling seafood consumption, SeaFood Business saidHere are some highlights from the list of the top suppliers:Red Chamber Company of California, which began as a small family owned restaurant in 1973, led all others with sales of $1 billion last year.American owned Trident Seafoods ranked second with sales of $925 million, followed by Pacific Seafood Group at $874 million.Canned tuna pushed Connors Brothers of Ontario to fourth place on the list with sales of $784 million. Ditto for Bellevue,  Washington’s Tri Marine International with sales of $780 million. Tri Marine supplies the country’s leading canned-tuna brands — Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea and StarKist — handling more than 600,000 tons of tuna annually.Also in the top 10 were Nippon Suisan USA, Unisea, Thai Union International, Fishery Products International of Newfoundland, Starkist and American Seafoods Company.One of the biggest fish stories last year was the merger of Japanese giants Maruha and Nichiro, making it the world’s largest seafood company with annual sales of nearly $8.4 billion. Maruha and Nichiro are Japan’s No. 1 and No. 3 seafood suppliers, respectively. Maruha’s holdings include Westward Seafoods, Supreme Alaska Seafoods, Alyeska Seafoods, Orca Bay and Prime Pacific Seafoods. Nichiro owns Peter Pan and Golden Alaska Seafoods. Japan’s No. 2 seafood company, Nissui, owns UniSea and Gorton’s, among other U.S. seafood suppliers.Read more about the top 25 seafood companies at www.seafoodbusiness.com.Japan no longer No. 1Europe and China combined now take more of Alaska’s seafood exports than Japan. According to a report by the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, in 2000 Japan received $854 million in Alaska seafood exports, 56 percent of the total value. Export value to Japan last year was fairly similar at $808 million, but it added up to only 33 percent of Alaska’s seafood export value.In contrast, ASMI reported that the value of Alaska seafood exports to all other destinations more than doubled during the same period, from $656 million in 2000 to $1.6 billion in 2006.In 2000, European countries received $159 million in Alaska seafood exports (11 percent of the total) and China received $68 million (5 percent). In 2006, the value of Alaska seafood exports to Europe was $580 million (23 percent of the total) and exports to China were valued at $365 million, 15 percent of the total.ASMI said the overall value of Alaska’s seafood exports has been growing steadily in recent years, from $1.5 billion in 2000 to nearly $2.5 billion in 2006.King of kingsYukon River king salmon are gaining a reputation as ‘the best’ among high-end restaurants and chefs. The kings, which travel 2,000 miles up the mighty Yukon, have the highest oil content of all salmon at 24 to 30 percent. That compares to an oil content of about 17 percent for Copper River kings.Seattle-based Jon Rowley, the food consultant and writer who is often credited with popularizing Copper River salmon, told the industry news site Seafood.com, “with proper handling Yukon kings could be the best eating of all salmons and perhaps even the best of all the fish.”Historically Yukon kings have been frozen and shipped almost exclusively to Japan. In 2002 Kwikpak Fisheries was formed by the Yupik community in Emmonak to create a market for fresh kings in the Lower 48. It is the only seafood company in the world certified by the Fair Trade Association, meaning Yukon River Kings from Kwikpak can be advertised as “fair trade”.Last year Emmonak residents built an ice plant, allowing local fishermen to take ice aboard their boats and chill the kings as soon as they are caught. The iced fish are flown 600 miles to a Kwikpak facility in Anchorage and quickly sent to awaiting markets. Fishermen are getting $4.30/lb for whole fish off the boat.State managers forecast a catch of 30,000 to 60,000 Yukon king salmon during the fishery that began June 15 and will last for two to three weeks.

It’s 47.1 years, compared to 38.3 for other state industries.What percentage of Alaska’s statewide fish harvesters in 2005 were nonresidents? It’s 38.6 percent, with total gross earnings of 60.4 percent. For processing workers, 67.3 percent were nonresidents, earning 66.2 percent of total wages.Those are just a few of the insights on Alaska’s seafood industry workforce now available from the state Department of Labor.  Easy-to-read tables and pie charts provide information through 2005 on harvesting and processing jobs for every fishery in each region, even offshore.  And for the first time, labor data for the seafood work force is compared with other Alaska industries.“We were interested in how much commercial fishing money ran through a region in a given year and how it compared to other industries there. When communities are applying for certain grants, it’s important to be able to document how many fishermen are working in their area,” said Department economist Andy Wink.Some of the data are startling, such as the number of nonresident seafood processing workers at the Aleutians and Pribilof Islands at 92.2 percent, and 79.7 percent for the Bristol Bay Borough.“At this point, we need them and they need us to get the jobs done. But there definitely is a lot of nonresident involvement,” Wink said.Groundfish (pollock, cod, flounders, rockfish, etc.) made up 37.6 percent of total fish landings in 2005, followed by salmon at 25.8 percent, halibut at 14.9 percent and crab at 12.7 percent.Data show that from 1997 through 2004, the seafood industry as a whole has been catching more fish with fewer people. Alaska communities that gained or lost the most resident fishermen during that time frame:Sitka gained the most at 31, Juneau and Metlakatla gained 11, Petersburg gained eight harvesters and Chugiak gained seven. In terms of losses, Hooper Bay  went from 32 fishermen in 1997 down to three in 2004. Kwigillingok went from 34 to five, Unalakleet dropped from 92 harvesters to 28, Shaktoolik went from 31 to 11 and Egegik went from 53 to 20 resident fishermen.For Kodiak, the number of residents who fished their permits in 2000 was 1,043; the number dropped to 830 in 2003; to 820 in 2004 and 819 in 2005.The statewide percentage of seafood industry workers employed in Alaska in 2005 was 15.2 percent, compared to 84.7 for other private sectors. For coastal Alaska, harvesting and processing comprised 36.9 percent, compared to 63.1 for other private sector workers. In all, the seafood workforce statewide totaled 50,305 workers; followed by 38,556 construction workers.Andy Wink said he is updating the seafood industry site now with 2006 data and he would appreciate “lots of feedback.” Find the site at http://almis.labor.state.ak.us/ (scroll down) and contact Wink at  907-465-6032 or at Andrew.wink @alaska.gov.Grant give always –Three grant programs are open now through September 10 for Alaska salmon industry stakeholders  in Southeast Alaska and Yakutat.  Why just Southeast?“It has to do with the funding source,” explained Debbie Mass of state Dept. of Commerce, Community and Economic Development.  “The money comes from the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, which we often refer to as the Southeast Sustainable Salmon Fund. These monies can only be used for salmon related projects in Southeast Alaska.”Salmon Vessel Quality Upgrade grants of up to $25,000 are open to permit holders and tender operators to help boost chilling or freezing capacity.Fisheries Economic Development grants are open to qualifying communities, non profits and small businesses and can be used for such things as cold storage facilities, or transportation and distribution improvements.   Maas said there is no limit on these grants so applicants can request as much as they’d like “although reasonable requests are appreciated.”Marketing grants are open to Southeast fishermen, and large and small processors.“Small direct market fishermen are limited to $25,000 and there is a 75% contribution from our department.  Mid-size processors can apply for up to $200,000 and we provide two thirds of the matching requirement. Anything above that is considered a major grant and it’s a 50/50 matching requirement,” Maas said.She added that the economic and marketing grants are competitive, meaning they are judged against each other. The vessel upgrade grant, however, is determined on a first come, first served basis.“Those applications don’t compete against one another. We’re already receiving many so it would be wise not to wait until the Sept. 10 deadline,” Maas cautioned.The state will determine how much to allocate to each grant program after all the applications are received. At least $875,000 is available among the three programs, maybe more. Contact Maas at 465-2023 or debbie.maas@alaska.gov .Permit surprise!  Every U.S. boat owner (except those in the military) could soon be required to get a water pollution permit to discharge bilge water, ballast water, even deck runoff.It stems from a California lawsuit in which a U.S. district court judge ruled last year that the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority by excluding certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels. The court revoked discharge exclusions which have been on the law books for 30 y ears, and ruled that all vessels will be required to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit under the Clean Water Act by September 30, 2008.The Marine Exchange of Alaska calls the new law “a nightmare for anyone who operates a watercraft, from a 950 foot container ship to a 14 foot outboard.”  State records show nearly 70,000 boats are registered within the state of Alaska. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, along with 8,400 vessels equipped with ballast water tanks making 86,000   port calls,  there are also 13 million recreational boats, 81,000 commercial fishing boats and 53,000 freight and tanker barges operating in U.S. waters.The EPA is appealing the federal court ruling. Meanwhile, the agency is asking for public comments should it be required to develop the new permitting program.

Ports in Louisiana and Virginia ranked No. 2 and No. 3 for seafood deliveries.Kodiak held onto fourth place for fish landings at 332.8 million pounds, down just slightly from 2005. Other Alaska ports making the top 50 list were Naknek/King Salmon at No. 12 with 105.7 million pounds, a slight increase from the previous year.Many others reflected significant delivery decreases. Petersburg ranked No. 17 at 58.2 million pounds, down from 95 million pounds in 2005. Deliveries to Ketchikan (No. 18) dropped by more than half to 50.3 million pounds. Sitka, ranked at No. 19, had an increase in landings to nearly 47 million pounds, up from 38 million.Cordova (No. 20) took the biggest hit with landings of 45.8 million pounds, a whopping decrease of 65.4 million pounds from the previous year. Deliveries to Seward (No. 25) also tanked at 36.8 million pounds, a drop of nearly 24 million pounds. Juneau (No. 39) landings increased from 18.5 million pounds to 19 million. Seafood deliveries of 15.6 million pounds to Homer (No. 44) reflected a decrease of more than 2 million pounds. Likewise, landings to Kenai (No. 49) of 11.7 million pounds last year showed a drop of 4.2 million pounds.In terms of seafood values, New Bedford, Ma. held onto the lead at $281 million. The all-time record of $282.5 million was set at that same port last year.  Dutch Harbor placed second with seafood value topping  $162 million at the docks, a drop of $1 million from 2005.  Kodiak jumped up one spot to No. 3 with fish values coming in at $101.4 million, an increase of $5.6 million.Total commercial landings (edible and industrial) by U.S. fishermen dropped 2 percent to 9.5 billion pounds in 2006, but the dockside value increased 1 percent ($51 million) to $4 billion. Finfish accounted for 88 percent of the total landings, but only 48 percent of the value. The average price paid to fishermen was 42 cents compared to 41 cents in 2005.Americans spent an estimated $69.5 billion for fishery products in 2006, including $46.6 billion at restaurants and $22.7 billion in retail sales for home consumption.By producing and marketing a variety of fishery products for domestic and foreign buyers, the commercial fishing industry last year contributed $35.1 billion to the U.S. Gross National Product.

That reflects an 11 percent increase in per capita consumption from six years ago, according to the National Fisheries Institute. The seafood consumption record of 16.6 pounds per person was set back in 1987 and matched in 2004.Market analyst Ken Talley said the only reason per capita consumption didn’t set a new record in 2006 stemmed from a huge drop in the popularity of canned seafood. Canned tuna consumption dropped below three pounds per person, while canned salmon   fell to just two-tenths of a pound, a 50 percent drop in one year.The list of America’s top 10 seafood favorites remained pretty much the same — shrimp held onto the No. 1 spot at 4.4 pounds per person. Canned tuna was second, followed by salmon at just over two pounds per person. Then came pollock and tilapia, which ousted catfish from the number five spot. Crab, cod, clams and scallops rounded out the top 10 favorites.The American Heart Association advises that eating fish just twice a week can reduce the risk of dying from a heart attack by 36 percent. Yet only 20 percent of Americans are following that healthy advice, according to the NFI.The 16.5 pounds of seafood pales next to the 62.8 pounds of beef eaten by each American last year. Chicken was a close second at 61.7 pounds per person. Ken Talley said according to the USDA, 1 million chickens are slaughtered every hour, 24 hours a day, every day of the year for American consumption.Fish at fast food –  More American consumers are saying they are dissatisfied with the menu offerings at popular restaurants and they want healthier choices. Those were the findings of a major study of nutrition trends at 37 leading chains by Technomic, Inc., a Chicago-based consultant for restaurants and food suppliers for 40 years.“The industry has been relatively slow to really embrace what we see is a truly growing demand for healthy, nutritious options,” said company vice president Bob Goldin.The chains that do the best job in satisfying consumer demands are Subway, Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Applebee’s.But while consumers clamor for healthier fare, Goldin says it often doesn’t transfer to their food orders.“It’s almost the politically correct thing to say that you want healthy choices. The chains say — yea, consumers say they want them, but when we offer them, they don’t order them,” he said.Goldin said consumer fears of contamination tend to be generalized over the entire seafood category. What about consumer awareness of wild or farmed fish?“The population at large is not really aware. The term wild tends to have a positive connotation, and farmed is slightly negative. But seafood is very rarely labeled that way in food service,” he added.Goldin said there is increased consumer awareness of sustainability issues.“The demand for social responsibility and environmental protections are growing, especially among younger consumers. We don’t think at this point it’s very well defined, but we do expect that to continue to grow as a demand among certain consumer groups,” he said.Goldin said in the food world there is growing demand for seafood – but it is not likely to   a big player at fast food outlets.“No, I don’t foresee that in any major way. Chicken is more versatile, lower cost and more readily available and has broader appeal. Fish and seafood is still pretty polarizing for many consumers,” he said.Inconsistent availability, costs and quality are the biggest challenges for seafood, Goldin said.   He credited Alaska seafood as having “a very powerful brand message.”In response to a recent Consumer Reports survey in which 92 percent of Americans said they want to know where their food is coming from, Goldin said: “I think consumers have always taken the safety of foods for granted, and now they are not as confident of the food supplies. I think it’s a wake up call.”Exxon update – Exxon/Mobil Corp. became the first publicly traded company valued above half-a-trillion dollars on July 12. According to Bloomberg News, Exxon shares rose 2.7 percent pushing the market capitalization of the company to $504.9 billion — more than the annual economic output of Argentina, Finland and Kazakhstan combined. A 40 percent gain in the past 12 months made Exxon/Mobil 26 percent bigger than General Electric Co., the next largest U.S. company. A bottleneck in U.S. refining capacity also helped earnings for the oil company, Bloomberg News said.<COL>Dutch Harbor catch increases<COL>2007-07-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/07/seafood-processor-deficit/<COL>Seafood processor deficitBy Laine WelchHundreds of seafood processing workers are still needed in coastal communities all across Alaska. Most of the jobs are entry level but many demand skills that go far beyond the slime line.“There are a lot of skilled jobs that can set the stage for a career in the seafood industry that pay decent wages and don’t demand a college degree,” said Laurie Fuglvog, an employment analyst with the state Department of Labor (DOL).Jobs include quality control technicians, cooks, electricians, plant and production managers, refrigeration mechanics and engineers, machinists and fresh fish coordinators. Positions can be located at shore based seafood plants and aboard at sea processing vessels, and when fisheries wrap up in one region, workers can be relocated to another through the Traveling Seafood Workforce program.Many seafood companies cover most transportation costs and room and board for their workers, Fuglvog said.”Each company has slightly different rules, but usually if you’re in a remote area you get a pretty good deal and it’s a great way to save money because there’s no place to spend it,” she said with a laugh.Fuglvog added that along with seasonal or year round career opportunities, seafood industry jobs provide a good training ground for younger Alaskans.”It’s a great opportunity for high school seniors or graduates to see different parts of Alaska and establish a work history,” she said.The availability of seafood industry jobs plus the opportunity to visit Alaska lure an increasing amount of foreign students each summer, Fuglvog said, but the state DOL works with seafood companies to attract and retain Alaska workers. Unisea, for example, formed the Alaska Hire committee several years ago to boost resident employment around the state.According to 2005 DOL data, seafood harvesting and processing accounted for 14.6 percent of all private sector jobs in Southeast Alaska, 18.9 percent in the  Gulf Coast and 51.9 percent throughout Southwest Alaska.Get more information on seafood processing jobs at any state job center, or apply on line at  www.jobs.alaska.gov .

Weathervanes are the largest scallops in the world with a shell diameter averaging ten inches.Historically, scallop fishing began in Alaska in the late 1960?s around Kodiak and Yakutat and soon expanded to Prince William Sound, the  Alaska Peninsula and the  Bering Sea. The fishery runs through mid-February, except at Kamishak Bay near Homer where scalloping runs from mid August through October.Just 10 boats have permits to fish for scallops in Alaska, although fewer usually are on the grounds. Scallop boats drop big dredges that make repeated tows along mostly sandy bottoms of strictly defined fishing regions. The fishery has 100 percent observer coverage and strict bycatch caps.There is a statewide harvesting cap of 1.2 million pounds of shucked meats – meaning the, large adductor muscle that pulls the two shell halves together. Last year, Alaska scallop landings totaled 487,000 pounds. At an average price of $7.86 a pound (up more than $2 from previous years), the scallop fishery was worth nearly $4 million at the docks.It’s scallops that each year nudge Dutch Harbor out of the nation’s top spot in terms of the value of seafood landings. Dutch boasts the biggest deliveries of any port, but the value goes to New Bedford, Massachusetts. More than 29 million pounds of shucked meats were harvested there in 2005, valued at over $223 million.Washington, DC watchProtections for our nation’s streams and wetlands were watered down by the Bush Administration last week. The New York Times reported that guidelines for enforcing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling governing wetlands were altered after lobbying from special interest groups, notably large cattle farmers and coal producers. Opponents said the altered rules will leave thousands of wetlands and streams unprotected and could have a profound effect on how federal laws under the Clean Water Act are applied.At a time when concerns over food safety are at an all time high – the Food and Drug Administration is poised to relax labeling requirements on irradiated foods. Since 1986 the FDA has allowed food companies to zap certain foods like spices, ground beef and poultry with high energy rays to kill harmful bacteria. The irradiated products must be identified and labeled with a seedling inside a dashed green circle. Irradiation does not make food radioactive and the technique has been endorsed by public health and medical groups around the world. But the term spooks consumers and most food makers have shied away from the technology. Now the FDA is moving forward on a petition by the food industry to do away with the labels, and expand irradiation to bagged salads, lunchmeats and other ready to eat foods. The Center for Food Safety opposes the measure saying irradiation can significantly degrade nutrients and generate potentially unsafe byproducts.Finally, saying the ‘stage is set and pre-wired for action’ – the White House Council on Environmental Quality last week pushed President Bush’s commitment to move forward fast with offshore aquaculture expansion in U.S. waters. A hearing by the House Fisheries Subcommittee is set for July 12.<COL>Seafood processor deficit<COL>2007-07-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/07/bristol-bay-is-all-about-fish/<COL>Bristol Bay is all about fishBy Maggie WallBristol Bay is the most productive wild salmon fishery in the world. Last year the bay had a harvest of more than 170 million pounds, mostly reds and kings, worth nearly $100 million to commercial fishermen.It’s Alaska’s most valuable salmon fishery — nearly one-third of all earnings from Alaska salmon come from Bristol Bay. And it has the most permit holders, topping 28,000 people.Those are just a few of the findings in a report by the University of Alaska’s Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER). It concludes that the entire region is ecosystem dependent, with salmon accounting for 52 percent of the region’s subsistence harvests, and 64 percent of all jobs.Scott Goldsmith is co-author of the study called “Economics of Wild Salmon Watersheds at Bristol Bay.” He says salmon and the lure of salmon drive not only the commercial fishery, but also almost all of the recreational and tourism activity in the region.Because it’s so tightly wound around the fish, Bristol Bay’s clock runs on a very precise annual boom and bust cycle. When the fish are there, there are jobs, when the fish are gone, so too, are the region’s employment opportunities.“As an economist, what was most interesting for me was to be able to quantify how much variation there was between the summer and winter — the level of economic activity that’s going on out there,” said Goldsmith. “There are about five times as many jobs in the summer than in the winter. That is unprecedented…it’s really amazing.”Clam Digger WarningsIt’s that time of year when lots of clam diggers head to sand flats. Don’t get so excited by the chase that you forget the perils associated with untested clams.Be sure and pay attention to shellfish advisories, like for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning.  Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning is caused by tiny marine organisms in algae blooms often referred to incorrectly as red tides.  PSP is commonly found in all kinds of clams. There’s no way to know if a clam is PSP free, except with a test. And to make matters worse, neither cooking nor freezing neutralizes the toxin, which attacks the nervous system and can be a quick killer.“It’s deadly,” says Ray RaLonde, an aquaculture specialist with the Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program. “It’s a thousand times more toxic than strychnine. It’s a neurotoxin, so it effects nervous transmission, which is why they call it PSP toxin. Often it starts out with a tingling around the face and extremities, the hands. Then it works its way through a number of symptoms, blurred vision, double vision, nausea, ultimately paralysis and cardiac arrest. Death is very quick.”Death is also very permanent, so don’t even think about dismissing warnings of PSP in clams.  Best to play it safe and limit your clam digging to the freezer section at the grocery.This one’s just for funWe’ve all heard those great stories about sailing the Seven Seas. Wow, to sail the Seven Seas is the height of adventure. Those of us who live by the ocean should easily be able to name the Seven Seas, right?Not so easy, you say. I couldn’t do it, and then after some research I learned that the stories I’ve been told are wrong. The Seven Seas has very little to do with the world’s oceans.That’s because you’re thinking with a 21st Century perspective.  To answer the question, you have to think of who first asked it.  Today, we tend to use the term the Seven Seas to talk about the planet’s oceans and traveling by water to lands far away.  But, the people who coined the phrase Seven Seas were ancient mariners. While they may have thought they were pretty smart, they were actually clueless to the fact that there was anything “out there.”Never mind that these folks never heard of the great cultures and civilizations on the other side of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These people didn’t even know there was an Atlantic or a Pacific Ocean.  Remember, we’re talking about the Flat Earth types who swore there were sea monsters waiting at the corner of the planet to eat them when they passed over the edge.OK. Now that you have the proper perspective, here’s one final clue.  Think literal. Think of “seas.” The first that comes to my mind is the Mediterranean. That’s one of seven. Add the Red Sea, Black Sea, Adriatic Sea and Caspian Sea.And of course there’s always an exception or two — and in this case we have two — the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean were also included on the list. Basically, the Seven Seas included the large bodies of salt water near the hub of Western Civilization and in the Middle East.For more information on the world’s oceans and seas go to the Woods Hole Science Aquarium web site and look at Frequently Asked Questions. www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/.

Heading into the mid-October start of the Alaska fishery, reports show less king crab is being imported, and the market appears to be balancing out a bit.Sackton said that, more than anything, the ‘wild card’ for king crab prices is still held by Japan. Japanese buyers will base their price offers and purchase on the yearend yen/dollar currency exchange rate. At this point, that’s anyone’s guess.Meanwhile, the “rock star” status of Alaska crab also will continue to boost sales.“People in Alaska don’t realize the tremendous extent the ‘Deadliest Catch’ television show has on the consumption and knowledge about crab,” said Boston-based Sackton.“You run into people who, in the past, have never given Alaska crab a second thought. All of sudden, they start spouting off facts and figures, and talk about what the fishermen go through and so forth. It is amazing the way this has become such a phenomenon, and the way people think about the crab. It’s been a tremendous boost for the whole industry.”Alaska crabbers last year harvested 15.5 million pounds of red king crab from the eastern Bering Sea waters called Bristol Bay. At a price average of $3.89/lb, the fishery was worth more than $60 million at the docks.Prices for Alaska snow crab, which shares the ‘Deadliest Catch’ spotlight on TV, are also determined by a country whose harvests dwarf the Bering Sea catch.Snow crab is the fancier restaurant name for opilio Tanner crab. It’s long been the bread and butter fishery for Bering Sea crabbers, who spend most of the winter pulling up pots of ‘opies.’By far, most of the snow crab being enjoyed by Americans comes from eastern Canada. The U.S. market consumes about 100 million pounds of opie leg clusters each year, of which just 10 million pounds, or 10 percent, comes from Alaska.After a big dip three years ago, snow crab prices have recently shot up, and that has industry watchers worried heading into the 2008 season.The increase stemmed from bigger demand during the times of lower prices, when wholesalers could get lots of snow crab below $3 a pound.Seafood Trends analyst Ken Talley reports current wholesale prices at a whopping $4.75 to $4.90 per pound for the most popular crab sizes.“The problem, in a nutshell, is when crab is priced at a level that retailers stop buying,” Sackton explained. “Inventory builds up and you start a getting pressure to lower prices. And that’s what’s happening this year.”The Alaska snow crab fishery typically gets underway in mid-January and lasts through April. The 2007 season yielded a harvest of about 35 million pounds. The average crab price to fishermen was $1.71 per pound, up from $1.15 and 84 cents the previous years.State managers will announce the harvest numbers for upcoming king and snow crab fisheries in September.Bristol Bay boostAll indications point to a more profitable salmon fishery at Bristol Bay this year. The sockeye harvest of nearly 30 million fish topped expectations and is slightly higher than last year’s catch.Most of the Bay processors ended up sending fleets home with an advance price of 62 cents per pound, and there are typically bonuses for refrigeration and other retroactive incentives. The 2006 average price for Bristol Bay sockeye was 66 cents per pound.“I think it’s likely we’ll do better than that when all is said and done,” predicted Chris McDowell, a longtime Bay fisherman and salmon market analyst for the Juneau-based McDowell Group.“For the whole Bristol Bay region, we’re probably looking at a value of more than $110 million, compared to $108 million last year,”Bristol Bay is home to the world’s largest sockeye, or red salmon, run. The region also provides more than two-thirds of Alaska’s total sockeye catch, which had a value last year of $180 million.McDowell said an additional 16 million sockeye salmon will come from other Alaska regions. That means the Alaska catch will top 40 million reds for the fourth year in a row.“That’s only happened 14 times in the history of the state,” McDowell said.The statewide sockeye catch is likely to come in at 46 million fish, ranking as the No. 8 sockeye harvest since the turn of the last century.Japan is no longer the primary buyer of the Alaska sockeye pack, last year purchasing only about 35 percent.“Alaska’s markets are about evenly split between Japan, the U.S. and Europe,” McDowell said. “So the big question is — with a 46 million sockeye harvest, to what extent are those other markets prepared to take the extra volumes that are Japan is no longer buying?”By all accounts, the mood this summer in Bristol Bay was upbeat.“It’s the fourth consecutive year we’ve had a very strong harvest and the price has been inching up,” McDowell said. “I think the general mood in the Bay is very hopeful.”He added that another encouraging sign is the increase in new entrants hitting the fishery since it bottomed out five years ago.<COL>Crab remains king<COL>2007-09-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/08/palin-could-promote-fish/<COL>Palin could promote fishLaine WelchSarah Palin could soon be “poster-gov” of Alaska seafood on national TV.The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute is negotiating with the Food Network to feature Palin with Alton Brown, a sort of Bill Nye the Science Guy of cooking. A major goal of the match up is to help clear up confusions about seafood in the marketplace.Their message will be simple: if it comes from Alaska, it is good for you.“When people go into a store they see seafood labeled wild, sustainable, organic ocean-raised-farmed fish – it’s really a jumble of phrases out there. She can help set the record straight,” said ASMI director Ray Riutta.Alton Brown hosts two programs on the Food Network – ‘Good Eats’ and “Feasting on Asphalt.’ Brown and the Governor will feature advice on purchasing Alaska seafood and cooking tips.  Palin might also appear with the Network’s wildly popular Rachael Ray and Bobby Flay, and be part of a media tour that includes Good Morning America, Today and Oprah.Riutta said Gov. Palin’s background as a commercial salmon fisherman makes her “a natural” to promote Alaska seafood.  She also represents an important population ASMI is trying to reach – women professionals in their 30s and 40s.A nation-wide Consumers Report survey revealed that 62 percent of Americans want to know where their foods come from. Sensational headlines about contaminated and tainted foods have people scrutinizing labels like never before. Riutta said Alaska as “the source” offers strong reassurance of food safety.“We’ve done testing on Alaska as a brand, at least domestically, and the numbers are overwhelming in favor of the Alaska seafood brand. We’re sure that carries overseas as well,” Riutta said.The details of Gov. Palin’s TV appearances are still being worked out. “We’re defining the how’s and the when’s. The Governor is always looking for opportunities to speak out about Alaska seafood,” said state fisheries policy advisor, Cora Crome.ASMI has a $1.6 million budget for fall and winter TV on the Food Network and other outlets.COOL Comments – Seafood origins are not as straightforward when it comes to cans. For the past two years, federal laws have required Country of Origin Labels (COOL) on most seafood items at U.S. retail counters. The COOL labels must also identify if the fish or shellfish is wild or farmed.But when the interim law went into effect two years ago, the Alaska industry was angered when the feds pulled a last minute switch and put canned, pouched and smoked seafood in the ‘processed foods’ category. That made those products ineligible for coverage under COOL.“We feel this is something that consumers want to know. There has been overwhelming public comment by Alaska fishermen, but the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture has not responded to those comments at this time,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska. “We feel there is tremendous interest by the public in having country of origin labels cover canned fish.”The bulk of Alaska’s annual salmon catch still goes into cans. Consumers have another chance to comment on the final COOL rule through August 20. Send to cool@usda.gov .Fish is foodThe West Coast’s largest commercial fishermen’s organization has joined forces with the nation’s farmers to protect the common interests of America’s food producers. It includes the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, which represents 14 different fishing groups in California, Oregon and Washington, and the National Farmers Union, whose membership includes 250,000 farm and ranch families.The groups believe they share many similar goals and problems.  “Fishermen and farmers face a lack of new people coming into the industry, being pressured by big food corporations or trade deals, and just generally getting walked over by bigger interests,” said PCFFA director Zeke Grader. “We felt it is important to align as much as we can because we have this common interest in saving our communities, and trying to produce good healthy, wholesome products.”The alliance comes at a time when the U.S. Farm Bill is being revised by Congress. As farmers of the sea, fishermen want to make sure they have a voice in shaping the policies and support programs covered by the bill.\“Fishermen are food producers, the same as farmers, and we need to have many of the same levels of protection and opportunity,” Grader said.\Cape Cod fishermen have joined with the region’s cranberry farmer to form the New England Farmer’s Union. United Fishermen of Alaska is also closely tracking the Farm Bill that is likely to be passed by Congress in 2008. The bill is revised every five years.<COL>Palin could promote fish<COL>2007-08-15<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/08/getting-%e2%80%98wild%e2%80%99-about-alaska-salmon/<COL>Getting ‘Wild’ about Alaska salmonby Laine Welch“Alaska Wild” is the now the official name of salmon sandwiches being served by an expanded number of Subway restaurants throughout the state.The salmon item, introduced at Subway/Kodiak two years ago, is being featured at 28 outlets in Anchorage, Eagle River, the Mat Su Valley and Denali Park through Labor Day.Tiffany Tutiakoff, a publicist at Northwest Strategies, came up with the idea of a “name the sandwich” contest, held last week at an Anchorage outlet.“I thought it would be great to get locals involved and give them some ownership in a product that is from Alaska,” she said.The “Alaska Wild” sandwich mix is made from Kodiak pink fillets and delivered to Subway ready to be spread on the bread.“It’s ultra convenient. You just open it up, it’s pasteurized and fully cooked,” said Chris Sannito, who produces the product under the Alaska Wildsource, Inc. label. “It’s lightly smoked with no salt, no additives and it’s unlike canned salmon texture. It’s really good stuff,”The Kodiak school district is also putting Wildsource salmon on the menu this year, in both sandwiches and heated dishes.“The kids like the idea that it could be pinks caught by their families,” Sannito said.Meanwhile, back at the Subway restaurants, “Alaska Wild” was outselling tuna.“I think people are really excited to have a local product, and to be able to support a small business at a place like Subway,” Tutiakoff said.If all 22,000 Subway outlets sold just 10 pounds of salmon per week, it would add up to nearly 12 million pounds each year, said Subway/Kodiak owner Dan Rohrer.Dredge dragA new design for scallop dredges could turn it into a kinder, gentler gear. The heavy metal dredges, which span 30 feet and can weigh two tons, are dragged across the bottom in pursuit of the pricey bivalves. An unintended consequence can be damage to marine habitat.Fisheries engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have built something better. The new lighter, more mobile dredge uses angled, hollow, netted hemispheres that are mounted on pivots for deflection, and on wheels instead of skid plates.The new dredge, which operates without a heavy bottom-leveling “cutting bar,” is undergoing test trials in the Irish Sea with good results, said MIT engineering guru Cliff Goudey.“We were able to get scallops up into the bag without having the cutting bar in front of it. I see that as a major accomplishment,” Goudey said.The MIT team is also engineering a new design for trawl nets.“It’s a trawl door with an acoustic sensor that you can automatically dial in how high you want to fish off the bottom,” Goudey explained.In many cases, firm bottom contact between the trawl door and the sea bed are not essential, Goudey said.“It’s only a matter of convenience and almost sloppiness that we do that. There is no reason why you couldn’t continue trawling and have the doors slightly off bottom while the net remains on bottom,” he added.Goudey said his motivation for new gear designs goes beyond protecting marine habitat.“It saves fuel and maintenance costs and it just makes more sense,” he said. “Whether it’s the gear getting torn up or the bottom, if it doesn’t need to happen why do it?”Cliff Goudey is also the creator of the Ocean Drifter, a giant mobile fish cage that can ping pong between continents, delivering live catches to world markets. “Within a year you’ll be hearing about that around Puerto Rico,” he said.From crab boat to showboatThe crab boat Aleutian Ballad was famous as one of the ‘Deadliest Catch’ fleet. But when it was capsized two years ago by a 60-foot rogue wave, the Ballad said goodbye to the Bering Sea.The 107 foot boat is now starring in a different role -  thrilling visitors with sea-going reality tours in calmer waters near Ketchikan. The new venture is the vision of Aleutian Ballad owner Dave Lethin, a Bering Sea crab veteran who conceived the tour idea 10 years ago.“I wanted to share the lifestyle and the allure that draws fishermen to the sea,” he said.Lethin has condensed a day in the fishing life into a four-hour tour. From the heated comfort of sheltered observation areas, up to 150 guests can watch the Aleutian Ballad’s seasoned crew launch and retrieve 700-pound pots full of crab and other sea creatures.“We pulled a pot and a 40-pound octopus was hanging on the outside. It rolled onto the deck and it took three of us to pry it off and put it into the live tank. They all were saying ‘wow, this is the real thing.’” Lethin said.The Aleutian Ballad is able to drop crab pots and other gears thanks to an exclusive licensing partnership with the Metlakatla Indian Tribe, which has total jurisdiction of the waters off its  Annette Island shorelines, an area of about 85 square miles.The tours began last week and Lethin believes the crew is giving guests an authentic glimpse of the fishing life.“They’ve seen it on TV, and now they get to feel the exhilaration when the crab pot comes over the side…they hear the water dripping off the pot and smell the bait and feel it crash down on the launcher,” said Lethin. “They understand now why we go back for more.”Check out the Bering Sea Crab Fishermen’s Tours at www.56degreesnorth.com.<COL>Getting ‘Wild’ about Alaska salmon<COL>2007-08-08<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/08/fisheries-science-careers-encouraged/<COL>Fisheries science careers encouragedLaine WelchA movement is afoot among Alaska educators and agencies to connect more young people from rural regions with careers in fisheries science and management.Every Alaska coastal community is dependent on its fisheries. But care and oversight of the resource has been entrusted to biologists and decision-makers from outside the region, or the state.“The question for years has been why young people from Kodiak or Bethel or Kaliganek or Pelican aren’t becoming these fishery scientists?” said Paula Cullenberg, director of the Alaska Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program.Over the past year MAP, convened groups from the university, fish/game/forest agencies, tribal councils and seafood companies to identify roadblocks to attracting these “recruits” and coordinate plans to overcome them.“It’s been a great alignment and everyone is so engaged,” Cullenberg said. “All the players are working together to make sure Alaska young people can purse careers in fisheries.”The School of Fisheries and Ocean Science at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks was armed in January with $5 million and a mandate from the Rasmuson Foundation to “create a top-notch fisheries degree program for undergraduates.” (Not just for science – it includes management, policy, business, etc.)  SFOS is developing the curricula and making plans for recruiting faculty and students. The new program should be underway in about a year.Meanwhile, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, facing a near staff crisis due to retirements, this year added a full-time position dedicated to recruiting young Alaskans.“It’s not unique to fish and game. It’s a national issue,” said Debbie Hart, coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Careers for Alaskans program. “We have an aging work force throughout America and a smaller pool of applicants coming up behind.”Fish and Game also is becoming more directly involved more high school students in partnership with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program at the University of Alaska/Anchorage.Hart said of Fish and Game’s staff of 1,400 just 60 are Alaska Native, or four percent.“Fish and Game is throughout Alaska and it is challenging to find people who want to stay long term and are committed to fisheries and marine science. We have this great resource of people who live there and are experienced and knowledgeable about their surroundings,” she said.  Nine new fisheries interns are working in the field this summer, Hart said, many on their home turf.Find more information at the Future Alaskans in Fisheries and Marine Science website at www.sfos.uaf.edu/.Yay for fillets! Fresh and frozen salmon is more popular than ever, but the product that most consumers want is convenient, easy to cook fillets. That hasn’t been lost on Alaska producers.Looking just at sockeye salmon – it’s still only 13 percent of total production, but market analyst Ken Talley of Seafood Trend said that total fillet output in Alaska last year approached 13.5 million pounds, up from 4.6 million in 2004, and a gain of more than 190 percent in just three years.Most of that – 11.7 million pounds – was frozen sockeye fillets, a 200 percent boost from 2004. Fresh fillet production jumped from 700,000 to 1.7 million pounds, a 143 percent increase.The fresh fillets have yielded higher market prices. The Alaska Salmon Price Report shows fresh sockeye fillets wholesaling last year at $5.46 a pound, compared to $4.18 in 2005.Frozen fillets jumped to $4.36 a pound, up 35 cents a pound from 2005.UniGoop – Former fisherman Tommy Gomes calls red sea urchins “California’s new gold rush.”  The red urchins are prized in Japan for their roe, called uni. The delicacy has turned urchins into one of the state’s most lucrative seafoods, with harvests of about 10 million pounds valued at more than $80 million a year.Gomes said he was bothered by the amount of urchin byproducts being tossed in pursuit of the uni.   “Being a fisherman, I thought man, this stuff makes great bait. Anyone who’s spent any time on the water knows that everything eats a sea urchin,” he said from his office at Catalina Offshore Products, a purveyor of high end seafoods in San Diego.Gomes began saving and freezing the guts in tubs and dubbed it UniGoop. Simply dangle a mesh bag over the side and “it’s like throwing popcorn in the park to pigeons,” he said, adding that Calico bass, halibut, and other popular sport fish find the all-natural attractant irresistible.Gomes has also developed a less messy version called UniButter that anglers can simply rub on their lures.  The UniBaits have scored big wins in 17 fishing tournaments so far along the West coast.“I started UniButter on my barbecue in my back yard,” he said. “People appreciate that I’m reusing stuff that would normally be thrown away. And the fact that it’s all made locally by local fishermen is amazing.”<COL>Fisheries science careers encouraged<COL>2007-08-01<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/10/mussels-are-first-defense/<COL>Mussels are first defenseBy Laine WelchCanaries are credited with alerting coal miners when their air is becoming unsafe. Can you guess what sea creatures provide the same service with our nation’s waters?Mussels provide the first line of defense for detecting toxins in our nation’s fresh and salt waters. Since 1986 the abundant bivalves have been at the heart of the Mussel Watch Project, the longest running water monitoring program in the U.S. The Watch monitors chemical and biological contaminants in water and sediment at nearly 300 coastal sites across the U.S. – including Prince William Sound and Kachemak Bay near Homer.Mussels are the fastest filter feeders of all bivalves, and in the process, they pick up whatever toxic material gets in the water.“Sometimes it’s very difficult to try and find very low concentrations of toxins in the water supply. Measuring water requires incredible precision and expense. So if you want to find something in the water, sampling mussels is an extremely good way to do it,” said Ray RaLonde, a Sea Grant aquaculture specialist.Toxicologists have found that mussels are particularly sensitive to copper, ammonia and several pesticides, which can wash into waters from surrounding land. In Alaska, mussels are an important monitoring tool for deadly PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poison) toxins and RaLonde hopes to expand Mussel Watch sites throughout the state.Amazingly, the blue bivalves also have been used for toxic clean ups.“If there’s an underwater dump of some sort, you can deposit mussels down there and they will pull those toxicants out of the system. Then you just dispose of the mussels and you have a clean up program,” RaLonde said.There are lots of mussels in Alaska’s fresh and salt water systems, but growing them commercially has posed some problems. In some areas the mussels tend to turn filtered silt into tiny hidden pearls that to diners, taste like a mouthful of sand. And healthy batches regularly become stressed by disease and other natural factors.“For two years it’s a healthy mussel bed, and all of a sudden it’s gone — just at the time when they are market size,” RaLonde said. In aquaculture, mussels are grown on roaps suspended from rafts and someday they will provide lucrative crops for Alaska growers.Mussel dredge fisheries still occur in New England, but most come from farms on both coasts. The nation’s top producer is Washington state where mussels are valued at $35 million annually. Farmers typically get $2-$2.50 a pound for their mussels, and market watchers say the supply does not even come close to meeting the enormous demand.Crab grab  – Bering Sea crabbers will enjoy a big boost in their catch quotas for the 2007/08 seasons.   Fishery managers on Friday announced a catch of 20.4 million pounds for Bristol Bay red king crab, up 31 percent from last year and the highest harvest level since 1990.For bairdi Tanners, a catch of 5.6 million pounds is nearly double last year’s take.For snow crab – the ‘bread and butter’ catch for the Bering Sea fleet – the harvest was boosted by 72 percent to 63 million pounds.  The Bering Sea crab fisheries open on October 15, although the snow crab season kicks off in earnest in mid-January.Split this – Splits of crab and cod fish will be hot topics for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council as it meets through Oct. 10 in Anchorage.The council will get its first look at an 18 month review of how the newly ‘rationalized’ crab plan is working for fisheries in the Bering Sea. Many communities will urge the council to consider broadening a controversial split that requires crabbers to sell 90 percent of their catch to select processors; just ten percent can be sold on the open market.The council will decide if it will move forward with analyses of different configurations of  80/20, 70/30 and  50/50 splits.“We have processors in Kodiak, King Cove, even Adak, who would love to be able to put an offer on the board and have fishermen bring them their crab. They are not allowed to do that now.  It is my hope the state will take the lead so we can get closer to a 50/50 split that allows more processors and communities to compete actively with Dutch Harbor, and gives fishermen the opportunity to get a more competitive price,” said industry consultant Linda Kozak.The Council will also grapple with how to fairly divide up cod catches in the Gulf of Alaska. A plan gaining favor mirrors one that’s worked well in the Bering Sea since the 1990s – it splits the cod catch among all gear groups based on their history in the fishery.Kozak says a sector split gives fishermen more flexibility to fish smarter.“One of the wonderful things about doing a sector split in the Gulf is that each gear group – jig fishermen, pot boats, longliners and trawlers – will all be able to fish at times when they can maximize the benefit, get the best quality and reduce bycatch. They will all be secure in the knowledge that their sector is protected from encroachment by the others. That’s what it’s all about,” she said.Hats off to Highliners – For more than 30 years National Fisherman magazine has selected top American harvesters for its annual Highliner Awards. The fishermen are recognized not only for their good catches, but also for contributions they’ve made to the fishing industry.NF editor Jerry Fraser said the nod this year goes to two Alaska fishermen – Kaare Ness, a  pioneer in the Bering Sea crab industry among others,  and Eric Jordan, a troll fishermen and industry advocate from Sitka. The fishermen will receive their awards during the Pacific Marine Expo in Seattle. www.pacificmarineexpo.com<COL>Mussels are first defense<COL>2007-10-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/08/what-does-%e2%80%98organic%e2%80%99-mean/<COL>What does ‘organic’ mean?Laine WelchWhat comes to mind when you hear the word “organic?” Most Americans say it’s food that contains no additives or chemicals, grown only with the help of nature.When it comes to seafood, the American ideal is “harvested from the wild.” Either way, Americans say the monikers would make them inclined to purchase better seafood.A nationwide study of shoppers and retailers by economists at Rutgers University and the New Jersey Dept. of Agriculture also revealed:• Nearly 80 percent of Americans preferred wild caught seafood – only nine percent opted for farmed.• The term “farm raised” conjured up use of antibiotics, hormones, genetic modifications and other negatives.• 76 percent said they would purchase organic seafood.• Barriers to increased seafood sales were lack of consumer knowledge at 86 percent, and lower prices at 46 percent.• 69 percent would be willing to pay a premium price if they perceive it as being safer than other products on the market.• 60 percent said they prefer domestic seafood products, and country of origin influences their purchases.Alaska marketers are using the survey information to fine-tune their messages for wild seafood.“They are willing to pay a premium for something labeled organic.  We also know that people who buy Alaska seafood also are willing to pay a premium for something that is wild and natural and sustainable and pure. So we are interested in learning what attributes they associate with the word organic,” said Laura Fleming, communications director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, which contracted the study.Organic food sales in the U.S., valued at about $18 billion, have grown 20 percent a year since 1997, compared to sales growth of just two to three percent for conventional foods.Organic standards have not been developed yet for U.S. seafood. Lawmakers have been struggling for years with outlining rules for how fish and other aquatic animals must be raised and handled in order to qualify for certification by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. However, the USDA cannot prohibit seafood companies from making ‘organic’ claims as long as they don’t use the USDA label. Seafood from other countries also can be labeled as organically grown and sold in the U.S.Ironically, wild caught fish are not likely to get the organic nod. The National Organic Standards Board ruled last year that: “Because the food sources and environment of wild fish are completely uncontrolled, they should not be considered organic.”Farmed fish is expected to get the green light, however.“Only inland, closed systems, which do not allow untreated effluents to pollute the surrounding environment, may be eligible for organic certification,” the NOSB said.Meanwhile, Alaska seafood will stay with its core messages.“More consumers recognize that ‘wild’ is something that ‘organic’ aspires to be, but never can be because of they way it’s handled,” said ASMI director Ray Riutta. “Wild is what organic would like to be.” Find the ‘U.S. Market for Organic Seafood’ study at www.alaskaseafood.org.Herring hatcheries?  A few weeks after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, herring spawned in Prince William Sound. The fish have never been the same since. A few lackluster fisheries have occurred since 1993, but for the most part, one of the world’s premiere herring fisheries has been considered in collapse. Prior to the oil spill, herring populations were estimated at 100,000 tons.Since the oil spill scientists have been studying the problems that are plaguing the fish. Some researchers now say it’s time to begin replenishing the stocks.“The stakeholders have voiced their concerns that we’ve spent a lot of money on research but haven’t moved toward any practical applications to determine if and how to restore the herring to the Sound,” said Howard Ferren, assistant research director at the Alaska Sea  life The Center has set up the first stage of a PWS herring enhancement project, similar to Alaska’s salmon hatchery program. The objective is to rear small herring to the point where they can be released into the water and successfully over winter.    Herring, like salmon, imprint on the area where they are born and return to that location after a few years at sea. A similar herring enhancement program in Japan has restored some stocks to commercial fishing levels.State managers say they will consider PWS herring stocks ‘recovered’ when the spawning population reaches 43,000 tons for six to eight years, and includes two strong age classes. Spawning must also occur in at least three regions.Ferren said pending phase two funding by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees Council, the Sea  Life Center could put test net pens of herring into PWS by 2009.Fish smarter -The WWF created the    contest   as a way to “inspire and reward” ideas to reduce bycatch – the accidental take of marine mammals, sea birds or small fish – by fishing gear.“The entry must also maintain the target catch,” Osmond said. “You don’t want to have something that reduces bycatch but at the same affects the target species, otherwise there is very little chance of getting it adopted.”The grand prize winner will receive $30,000, and two runners up will each take home $10,000.Last year’s winner was a New Jersey inventor who placed strong magnets just above baited hooks on longlines and found that it repelled sharks while not reducing catches of tuna and swordfish.    The  2007 Smart Gear winners will be announced at the Pacific Marine Expo in Seattle in mid-November.<COL>What does ‘organic’ mean?<COL>2007-08-29<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/09/guts-%e2%80%93-without-the-glory/<COL>Guts – without the gloryBy Laine WelchCordova signed off its busiest-ever salmon season with a salute to the workers who get all of the guts and little of the glory – the processing workforce.Seafood workers were tasked extra hard this summer to keep pace with a record 63 million pink salmon catch at Prince William Sound, plus two million sockeyes from the famous Copper River, the third-largest red salmon harvest.Most of the region’s fish passes through five large processing plants in Cordova, where from May through September, the ‘slime line’ and dock crews process salmon and halibut into a variety of products.“It’s not just the fishermen and tenders and everyone who is running all this fish around. The final link to the customer is in the hands of the hundreds of processing workers who are here in Cordova,” said Torie Baker, a   Sea Grant marine advisor. The processing crews hand off the fish to 30 local barge, ferry and airline transporters who send it to markets around the worldTo salute their efforts, the City, local Chamber of Commerce, local electric co-op and fishing organizations pitched in to buy 800 T-shirts commemorating the record salmon season. Baker said they took extra care to acknowledge the visiting foreign students who comprise about 20 percent of the workforce.“We had ‘thank you’ translated into 10 languages,” Baker said.The city also issued a proclamation of appreciation to the workers at presentations last week at each of the seafood plants.“Our crews worked non-stop for months,” said Trident manager Bill Gilbert. “I’m certainly proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish.”Pride aside, Cordova’s seafood industry is hopeful that the pat on the back will prompt the processing workers to report for work again next year.“We hope the shirts and our community show of support will encourage them to return to Cordova,” Baker said.Figures from the state Dept. of Labor show that, year after year, Alaska’s seafood processing industry employs the greatest percentage of nonresident workers of any sector — more than 14,500 in 2005, accounting for 74 percent of the processing workforce. Nonresidents earned $184.3 million, or nearly 67 percent of the $276.6 million total wages paid to seafood processing workers.Get some class – Congress is retooling the U.S. Coast Guard Authorization Act, and proposed changes could drastically affect commercial fishing operations.Popping up in political discussions is reference to fishing boats being classed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or a similar ‘classification society’.“Shipping bureaus typically classify international cargo ships, tankers and cruise ships. Not fishing boats,” said Joe Childers, president of United Fishermen of Alaska. “It’s a process very few people in the fishing industry have ever even heard of.”The American Bureau of Shipping was originally formed in 1862 to certify ship captains. Today it is the third largest class society with a classed fleet of over 10,000 commercial vessels.“Classed means they’ve rigorously looked at its structural integrity, its ability to maintain power, propulsion systems, dewatering devices, navigation equipment, the arrangement of the deck machinery, basically everything on the vessel,” Childers explained.Initially the classification requirements will hit boats 50? or greater with smaller vessels exempted until 2018. At that time, all vessels that are 25 years or older will also require classification.“I believe if this were to go into effect you’d find that a lot of boats fishing today in Alaska would be worthless. They’d be obsolete – you wouldn’t be able to use them and you wouldn’t have a market,” Childers said.The Coast Guard estimates roughly 80,000 commercial fishing boats are operating in the U.S.The bill to watch in the Coast Guard Act is HR 2830, coming out of the transportation subcommittee chaired by Rep. John Rayfield of North Carolina. It is scheduled for a  hearing this session.Foods less traveled – Americans prefer foods produced in the U.S.  – and the closer to home the better. That’s been a consistent finding by national polls that are closely tracking consumer attitudes about the safety of our nation’s food supply.An Iowa State University survey released last week said that 85 percent of Americans have confidence in the safety of their local and regional food systems. Just 12 percent feel confident about foods produced anywhere else in the world.Another poll by the Sacred Heart University Polling Institute revealed that 80 percent of Americans are checking food labels for ingredients and origins, an increase of 16 percent from one year ago.That’s a plus for U.S. seafood because by law, all fresh and frozen products must be labeled with its country of origin, and if it is wild or farmed.“That’s not the case for other products. Providing that information is more costly, but there is no doubt consumers want it,” said Rich Pirog, a Marketing and Food Systems expert at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State.Also important: how far foods travel to make it to your plate. “People are starting to look at the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain. It’s a trend we’re seeing in the U.S.,” Pirog said.Transport by plane produces the highest carbon emissions, followed by truck, rail and water.Pirog said Alaska seafood has a “good environmental track record” and that   could help trump consumer concerns over travel miles.“That’s got to have an advantage over a product that isn’t sustainably caught and it is coming from fisheries half way around the globe. Customers want to support foods grown in the USA and the fact that there is still product that is wild caught plays to Alaska’s advantage.<COL>Guts – without the glory<COL>2007-09-26<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/09/salmon-harvest-breaks-record/<COL>Salmon harvest breaks recordLaine WelchCatches are still trickling in, but Alaska’s 2007 salmon harvest is already one for the record books.As of Sept. 7 the total tally had topped 200 million fish, making it the fifth-largest salmon harvest in history. Preseason forecasts pegged the 2007 harvest at 180 million fish, up 21 percent from the previous year.Powering the 2007 season? Pinks.Strong runs throughout the Gulf produced hefty hauls in the primary production regions of Southeast Alaska, Kodiak and especially Prince William Sound, where the catch topped 60 million pinks to set an all-time record. The statewide harvest of roughly 135 million pink salmon (compared to 73 million last year) ranks second to the largest catch of 161 million pink salmon taken in 2005.Alaska’s sockeye salmon harvest of 47 million ranks at No. 8 since the turn of the last century. Nearly 30 million of the total red take came from Bristol Bay.“It’s the fourth year in a row that the Alaska sockeye catch has topped 40 million. That’s only happened 14 times in the history of the state,” said market analyst Chris McDowell. Alaska’s largest sockeye salmon catch was 64 million, taken in 1993.“Sockeye and pinks are the big success stories for this season. Chinook, coho and chum salmon (runs) weren’t as strong as we were expecting, but there were still pretty good harvests,” said Geron Bruce, assistant state director of commercial fisheries.Chum salmon catches might reach 16 million, out of a projected 25 million fish. For chinook (king) salmon, a statewide harvest of 498,000 is well below the forecast of 789,000 fish.Bruce said cohos are still coming in, but those runs have been a bit disappointing statewide. The total take so far of 2.6 million silvers is down by nearly half of the preseason, projected catch.State number crunchers are busy calculating the value of Alaska’s 2007 salmon season, but it’s safe to say it will continue on its upward trend.The higher catches and an uptick in salmon prices across the board will boost the dockside value above last year’s $346 million for a harvest of 141 million fish.Bruce said all signs point to continuing bountiful catches throughout Alaska.“We’re in the highest period of sustained commercial salmon harvests in Alaska history, and it’s continuing. That’s the key thing,” he said.Alaska’s all-time record salmon catch was 221 million fish taken in 2005.Healthcare and fishermenAlaska commercial fishermen face added burdens when it comes to getting good healthcare coverage.A study by the United Fishermen of Alaska reveals that Alaska fishermen are nearly four times more likely than other residents to work or live in a community without a hospital, and are less likely to carry medical insurance.“Some don’t even have a clinic, and few have a hospital. That means Alaska fishermen have the added burden of travel costs added to the costs of getting the medical treatments they need,” said UFA executive director Mark Vinsel, who compiled the healthcare study. “We think that Alaska fishermen are among the most underserved demographics in the state.”Alaska residents are further challenged because the state is served by far fewer private insurance companies that offer individual or small business medical coverage than other states. Alaska also has the highest healthcare costs in the nation.The UFA study reveals that, when it comes to health issues, fishermen are good candidates for coverage.“All the health insurance providers ask first if people use tobacco or if they are obese. Most fishermen don’t smoke compared to the general population, and they are lean, hard-working people. In the competitive insurance marketplace, it may be a bargain to provide coverage,” Vinsel said. He added that injuries at sea are covered by the Alaska Fishermen’s Fund, with some limitations.UFA is also concerned that lack of access to affordable healthcare will force young people to opt out of fishing.“Lack of health insurance is a significant barrier to entry for the next generation of commercial fishermen. As the fleet continues to ‘gray,’ there is ultimately a threat to domestic seafood harvests and communities that depend on fishing businesses,” said UFA President Joe Childers.Alaska provides more than half of all U.S. seafood landings, and that needs to be maintained and protected.“If there are not people to harvest these fish, the seafood balance of trade will be affected dramatically,” echoed Vinsel.UFA will refine its preliminary healthcare data, and work with other national fishing groups and elected state and federal officials to further the cause.Meanwhile, Vinsel said some fishermen might find relief from a bill introduced to the Alaska legislature last session by Senator Hollis French of Anchorage.SB 160, which would provide subsidized healthcare for people meeting federal income guidelines, was set for a joint Health and Education/Labor and Commerce committee hearing this week. Find the UFA study at www.ufa-fish.org/doc/healthcare2007.pdf.Fishing trends A look back over 11 years shows some telling trends for Alaska’s halibut and sablefish (black cod) fisheries.Since 1994, both fisheries have operated under a system that gives Individual Fishing Quotas of the catch to Alaska longliners based on their historical participation.Each year, federal managers provide a Report to the Fleet, now dubbed the “Pacific Halibut-Sablefish IFQ Report.” The latest gives an overview through 2005.At a glance, the report shows that quota shares have consolidated into the hands of fewer persons than those who received shares initially, although most of the quota remains in Alaska hands.There are far fewer boats out on the water, however. In 1993, a fleet of 3,393 vessels fished for halibut, compared to 1,276 in 2005, a drop of 62 percent.For sablefish, the number of boats went from 969 to 378, down 61 percent.Homer has ranked as the No. 1 port for landings for eight of the past 11 years. Kodiak claimed the lead three times, but has mostly kept a lock on the No. 2 spot.Seward has remained the top Alaska port for sablefish landings, with Sitka and Dutch Harbor trading back and forth for No. 2.The report shows that 300 harvesters have taken loans through the North Pacific Loan Program, which each year provides $5 million to help fund newcomers into the IFQ fisheries. Of those loans, 181 were from Alaska.They’ll need all the financial help they can get. Industry reports show quota shares of sablefish fetching up to $16 per pound in prime fishing regions (Southeast Alaska and the Central Gulf). And get this: halibut shares are selling for up to $26 per pound.The average dock price paid to fishermen in 2006 for halibut was $3.71 a pound, up 70 cents from the previous year. For sablefish, the price was $2.45, up 35 cents.Both fisheries begin in March and end in mid-November.<COL>Salmon harvest breaks record<COL>2007-09-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/10/modern-dock-comes-to-dutch/<COL>Modern dock comes to DutchBy Laine WelchAn ultra modern, multi-use marine facility will soon bring a new way of doing business to Dutch Harbor.Under construction now are a 900-foot dock, an enclosed seafood sorting atrium and a huge cold storage. The new facility will replace decaying woodpile docks and buildings that date back to World War II.“We looked at this and said things need to be done better at our nation’s No.1 fishing port. You simply cannot continue doing business across these docks and especially without a modern cold storage,” said Per Brautaset, vice president of DH Ports LLC, builder and operator of the $150 million multi-use facility.  The company has a 100-year lease agreement with Western Pioneer for the property located at Dutch Harbor Bay.A 30,000-ton capacity cold storage will allow more time for companies and individuals to add value to their catches. More importantly, the storage will provide them with more shipping options.“It will allow some breathing room for a company to offload their products and wait a few weeks to figure out where the best markets are. Now many fishing companies are at the mercy of whatever transportation companies come in,” Brautaset said.The cold storage will also help relieve the drain on electric power by the more than 1,000 seafood freezer vans in lots dotting the island that are kept running round the clock.“One of the biggest problems is the high energy cost from always running on peak power. It affects the entire community,” Brautaset said.DH Port’s new docks will finally give a breather to boats that must now jockey for space and services. Most of the boats come to port laden with boxes of frozen fillets or crab and must be stacked outside awaiting transport to world markets.At the DH Ports facility the boats will be able to offload directly into an enclosed sorting atrium.“Fishermen and companies work hard to produce the very best quality product. It’s a real shame to see these products get compromised in their handling,” Brautaset said.The poor condition of packaging is one of the biggest complaints seafood customers in Europe and Japan express.“Many buyers have very tight quality controls and all of a sudden they see these products coming from Dutch Harbor that look like hell. The product on the inside is top quality and the best in the world. But it is totally deficient in the way it is presented,” he said.“What is needed immediately to support the seafood industry in Dutch Harbor and Alaska in general is finding ways to enhance value, and putting out a product that is at the forefront of quality assurance and security requirements,” Brautaset added.DH Ports is a welcome addition to the community and couldn’t come at a better time, said Dutch Harbor/Unalaska Mayor Shirley Marquardt.“To have a group of private investors make such an enormous investment in our community is very exciting. We continue to be short on dock space for fishing vessels and transport ships for much of the year, and with the planned activity in the Chukchi Sea and the North Aleutian Basin, we will need every available foot to continue to serve all interested parties,” Marquardt said.“We are excited to show the world that Dutch Harbor is making investments to do the job right,” echoed Brautasen.The DH Ports marine facility plans to be open for business in January 2009.Man overboard!  Falling overboard on a fishing boat doesn’t make big headlines like ‘all hands lost.’ But those so-called ‘one bys’ are a main way that fishermen meet their Maker.That sad fact is underscored in a startling new report that tracked ‘man over boards’ in Alaska from 1990 through 2005. The ‘falling overboard’ report comes out of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Anchorage office.It shows that of the 296 fishing deaths in Alaska during that time, 71—or nearly one-quarter— were from falls overboard. The most common circumstances were working with fishing gear, being alone on deck, losing balance or slipping, heavy weather and use of alcohol.The report reveals that in Alaska, the deadly incidents differed between fishing gears and regions. Crabbing accounted for 26 fatal falls, 25 for salmon fisheries and 19 for groundfish.They were concentrated on three gear types: 34 percent on boats with pots, 28 percent on gillnetters and 20 percent for longline vessels. Most of the man overboards occurred in South-central Alaska waters; with the fewest in Southeast.Salmon gillnetters had 14 falls overboard, the most of any salmon gear type. Alcohol was involved with 35 percent of the gillnet fatalities. No alcohol related falls were cited for Alaska boats using pot gear. Simply wearing a personal flotation device would have saved many a fisherman.Find the ‘Fatal falls overboard on Alaska fishing vessels’ report in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine or contact the NIOSH office in Anchorage.October is National Seafood Month – a distinction proclaimed by Congress nearly a quarter century ago to recognize one of our nation’s oldest industries. Government figures show that nationwide, the seafood industry provides more than 250,000 jobs and contributes $60 billion to the U.S. economy each year.Alaska deserves special merit during Seafood Month, as it produces over half of our nation’s seafood – more than all the other states combined. The seafood industry is Alaska’s number one private employer. It ranks second only to Big Oil for the tax dollars it pumps into state coffers.Here are some more fish facts: Americans continue to eat more seafood each year, topping 16 pounds per person in 2006.  (That compares to 63 pounds of beef.)  America’s seafood favorites have remained largely the same. The top five are shrimp, canned tuna, salmon, pollock and tilapia.The 16 pounds of seafood that Americans eat pale when compared to other parts of the world. The Japanese, for example, eat 146 pounds of seafood per person each year. U.N. figures show that in Greenland, it’s 186 pounds and more than 200 pounds per person in Iceland. At Saint Helena in Africa, people eat nearly that much. The country with the lowest seafood consumption is Afghanistan at zero. And where in the world is the most seafood eaten? In the South Pacific islands of Tokelau, each person eats more than 400 pounds of seafood every year.<COL>Modern dock comes to Dutch<COL>2007-10-10<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/10/exxon-payout-expected-soon/<COL>Exxon payout expected soonLaine WelchBy the end of October, thousands of Alaska fishermen will know if they are going to be getting checks in the mail from Exxon.The U.S. Supreme court is set to decide Oct.29 whether or not it will hear Exxon’s final appeal of a $2.5 billion punitive damages award stemming from the 1989 oil spill in Prince William Sound.“If the Court decides to not hear Exxon’s case, then it’s over.  Exxon has no other recourse, no other place to turn to try and further delay the payment that was adjudicated in 1994 in Anchorage,” said Frank Mullen, a Soldotna fisherman and spokesman for Oiled Fishermen, an ad hoc group with members from Cook Inlet, Cordova, Kodiak and Prince William Sound.If the court closes the door on Exxon, more than 330,000 Alaska fishermen and others hurt by the 1989 oil spill will finally share damage awards totaling $4.5 billion, including interest.Some awards will be sizeable, and claimants fear they will be clobbered by huge tax hits from Uncle Sam. The Oiled Fishermen are backing a bill (S.552) by Sen. Lisa Murkowski that would allow tax payments to be deferred over time.“As it stands now, most fishermen would be paying 35 percent of their award in year one,” Mullen said.The Oil Spill Tax Treatment Act provides for one-time retirement contributions and income averaging of awards over time.“We are not looking for a handout. We expect to pay our taxes,” Mullen said. “We’re asking that we be allowed to put all or a portion of our award into an IRA account, whereby we’d be paying taxes on it as years went by, not in one huge hit. It would be spread out over the remaining years of the fishermen who are still alive.”The Oiled Fishermen are fueling a grassroots effort to build national support for the one-time tax treatment. The group so far has raised $18,500 for a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. and may send fishermen to testify at hearings this year.Mullen said response by key policymakers has been favorable.“No one opposes it, and many are enthusiastically in favor of it,” he added.Still, Mullen said it’s a huge undertaking to get a law passed by Congress, and subject to the whims of the lawmakers.“Unless they are hearing from people, other than just Alaska’s delegation, they have no reason to want to move the bill,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska.“It’s a complex process and a lot must happen in a tight time frame,” echoed Mullen. “If we don’t get any action (by Congress) in the next year, it might pass us by.”Mullen said Alaska fishermen are ‘hopeful but wary’ of the Washington lawmakers, “who might turn a more favorable eye to the world’s largest oil giant.”Contact mullenf@alaska.net for more information on the Oiled Fishermen tax relief effort; also UFA in Juneau, or www.Murkowski.senate.gov.Crab Tours and Bad Boys: The Anchorage-based Crab Broker is famous for its fresh, never, ever frozen king crab. The Brokers are also gaining fame for their annual ‘Connoisseur Tours’ that bring chefs and upscale retailers right to the crab grounds.Rob George and Eric Donaldson began organizing the tours two years ago during king crab fisheries at Nome and Dutch Harbor.“We really wanted to get them in touch with their ingredients, and gain an appreciation of the Alaska industry,” said Rob George, as he prepared to set off to Dutch Harbor with the biggest group ever.We have more than 60 people coming from as far away as Germany, others are from the Lower 48 — chefs, upscale retail buyers, some media,” he said.The group will spend three days in Dutch as the season’s first king crab is offloaded next week.“We’re going to have some pots a few miles offshore and we’ll pull the gear– they’ll see everything, every step of the way,” George said.The visitors will experience all phases of crab processing at Unisea, and watch how transport crews scuttle to get the crab to awaiting world markets.“They are going to understand everything — from pot to plant to plane to plate,” said George.Beyond the docks, the Crab Brokers also have partnered with the crews of the Cornelia Marie and Time Bandit to make personal appearances and promote Alaska crab. To avoid any conflicts with ‘Deadliest Catch’ licensing agreements, the guys came up with a new identity – Bering Sea Bad Boys.“Everybody loves the Bad Boys – they’ve got a huge following. It’s almost like a cult,” George said.

We want to build future year classes of fishermen,” said Sunny Rice, a Sea Grant Marine Advisory Agent in Petersburg.“If folks were to sell their quotas and their permits and their boats to the first taker or highest bidder, and if none of those people were residents in those coastal communities, the communities will lose access to the resource,” she added.Rice is co-organizer of the Summit that brings together a lively mix of policy makers, market experts, business advisors and more. For two days they will key in on several elements important to tomorrow’s fishing leaders — participating in the regulatory process, how Alaska fish fits into the global market and running a fishing operation like a business.Rice encourages communities and fishing groups to sponsor young fishermen to attend the event.“We’re hoping that folks will look around to see who’s that deckhand that shows a lot of promise – someone they think could and will be a future leader in the fishing industry,” she said.The Young Fishermen’s Summit is set for Dec. 11-13 at the Anchorage Sheraton.

The same shopping interest holds true for customers of Alaska seafood, who are finding good bargains at current exchange rates.When the dollar is down compared to other currencies, Alaska seafood is a better deal, explained fisheries economist Gunnar Knapp at the Univ. of Alaska/Anchorage.“When the dollar drops, it strengthens foreign demand and will help bid up the price for those markets,” Knapp said.Seafood buying interest is especially good in Europe, where the Euro is now much stronger than the dollar.“That’s good news for Alaska pollock, and also increasingly for salmon,” he said.It’s a different story for Japan, where the yen/dollar ratio has been holding fairly steady for several years.“All the stuff that’s going on with the value of the dollar and exchange rates at the moment are not affecting our Japanese markets one way or the other,” Knapp said.While it may be business as usual in terms of currency, Alaska’s long seafood relationship with Japan is changing. In the not-too-distant past, for example, nearly all of the Alaska sockeye salmon catch went to Japan; today, it’s closer to 35 percent. More Alaska seafood now goes to developing markets in the United States and Europe, and to China for reprocessing.“It’s something we don’t normally think about in terms of our fisheries. But exchange rates are a reminder that Alaska seafood competes in a global market,” Knapp said. “And for the moment, they are working in our favor.”Seafood futuresAlaska’s world reputation for fisheries’ “staying power” puts its seafood in good position for future markets. So says industry veteran Howard Johnson, advisor to seafood clients in the United States and abroad.“Alaska is clearly well-positioned,” Johnson said. “I hear more and more about issues of sustainability from conservation groups and the industry.”Major companies around the world have pledged to source seafood only from well-managed fisheries.“That is playing real well in Europe, and could still play well in the U.S.,” Johnson said.Alaska salmon, pollock, halibut and sablefish fisheries have merited worldwide recognition for sustainable management. Crab, cod and flounder fisheries are also in the certification pipelineThe Alaska “brand” for seafood healthfulness and purity is another plus.“Particularly when we have these issues of imports and contamination and so forth,” Johnson said.Johnson predicts consumers will be paying more for seafood.“I think we’re in for a period of higher seafood prices, which is good for Alaska, but not so good for consumers,” he said. “What may happen is more products destined for the Lower 48 might wind up in Europe, because they can pay more for it.”Johnson said he does not think the global warming concern of “travel miles” will play against Alaska seafood purchases.“When you think about it, 81 percent of the seafood we consume in the U.S. is imported,” he explained. “So in terms of food miles from Alaska to the States, it’s not a very big deal compared to food miles from China, Thailand or Vietnam.”Seafood economists predict demand will approach a whopping 90 billion pounds within 20 years – and most of it will come from aquaculture.“The only place we will be able to get that extra production is from aquaculture – no matter how well we manage our wild fisheries,” Johnson said. “You have to be realistic. More people are asking, ‘where are we going to get our fish 20 years from now?’ They need to know because they need to plan their businesses.”Johnson said he believes Alaska is missing the boat.“Alaska has the processing infrastructure in place,” he said. “There should be a way for aquaculture to complement what’s happening on the wild side. And I suspect someday it will probably happen.”The distinction between the wild capture and farmed seafood business is becoming blurred, Johnson said, and more companies will continue to expand into both.“From a business standpoint, it makes good sense. Fishermen in Alaska might not like the idea, but if companies want to grow their business, they have to play both sides,” he said.Looking ahead most fronts of the Alaska seafood business are looking good, Johnson said. He pointed to the recent purchase of Icicle Seafoods by San Francisco-based investment company Fox Paine as an example.“That reflects that the investment community is looking to the seafood industry with some favor, which in the past they have not really done,” he said. “And if you’ve got an investment company owning a company that is heavily involved in Alaska seafood processing, their perspective is going to be a bit different than the founders of that company that started as Alaska fishermen.”Find Johnson’s 14th-annual report on the U.S. seafood industry at www.hmj.com.Solar salmon scores awardThe first solar-powered salmon fishery at Lummi Island, Wash., won the 2007 Governor’s Award for Pollution Prevention and Sustainable Practices. It went to members of the Lummi Island Wild Salmon Co-op, who used solar panels this summer to fuel the banks of batteries that power their reef net winches.“Even on a cloudy day, there was never a time when we were low on power. It was fantastic,” said co-op spokesman Ian Kerouac. Reef-netting is the world’s oldest form of salmon fishing. Check it out at www.lummiislandwild.com/Crab watchBering Sea crabbers last week set a minimum price of $4.35 per pound for red king crab, and say they won’t fish for less. The base price was $3.50 last year, which settled out at $3.93 after all the sales were made. Crabbers say the price boost is realistic, due to a big decrease in supply and increase in demand. The Bristol Bay fishery starts Monday, but crabbers won’t cast off without a price settlement.“Fishermen are not compelled to being fishing on Oct. 15, so a stand down is certainly a possibility” said Greg White, a negotiator for the crabbers.More Alaska fish goes greenAlaska cod and flounder fisheries could be the next to merit an “official” stamp of approval from the international Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as being well-managed. The eco-labels are becoming increasingly important in world markets, where major buyers have pledged to source seafood only from sustainable fisheries. Alaska salmon, pollock, halibut and sablefish  have all merited the MSC label.The Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation is taking the lead for MSC certification for all sectors of the Pacific cod fishery.The newly formed fishing cooperative, “Best Use Coalition,” is sponsoring a similar effort for the Alaska flatfish industry. Flatfish (like sole) might have a much lower profile, but their dockside value of $163 million in 2006 makes them third in value behind pollock and cod.<COL>Future of Alaska seafood markets looks bright<COL>2007-10-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/10/sustaining-omega-3/<COL>Sustaining Omega 3Laine WelchTwo terms have become tops in the English vocabulary and both benefit Alaska seafood.The first is “Omega 3 fatty acids,” which is ranked as this year’s most popular food additive and will be found in more items than ever. That’s according to USA Today, one of the nation’s most widely read news sources. A primary market is the nearly 80 million U.S. baby boomers, said a HealthFocus USA Trend Survey, and four in 10 adults are seeking more omegas in their diets.“It’s just been in the last few decades as we’ve industrialized our food supply that we’ve basically eradicated this nutrient from our diet. When you don’t get it, all kinds of bad things start happening,” said Randy Hartnell, a former Bristol Bay fisherman, now owner of the popular seafood web business Vital Choice. (www.vitalchoice.com)Omega 3’s can’t be produced by our bodies and must be obtained from foods, notably fish and some plant sources. Many nutritional studies from around the world show that all omegas are not created equal, and the most important compound (DHA) is far more abundant in fish oils than any other food source. The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute lists sockeye (red) salmon as having the highest amount of Omega-3 of any fish, with approximately 2.7 grams per 100-gram portion. (www.alaskaseafood.org) Based on American Heart Association guidelines, that means just one serving of sockeye salmon per week can help to lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.Two years ago Omega 3’s were added to 120 American food products. Last year that number jumped to 250 and it is growing fast. Tropicana, for example, launched the first orange juice fortified with omega 3’s and Kellogg has taken the lead in adding it to cereals. Ditto, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.Natural food company Earth’s Best includes omega 3’s in its infant formula, as more studies show it adds to babies’ brain development. Omega 3’s are also in some eggs, produced by chickens that are fed a diet high in canola oil.The amazing health properties of omega 3’s have not been lost on the multi-billion dollar pet food industry. Procter & Gamble added the nutrient to some of its pet foods way back in 1993, followed a year later by Iams. That company expanded its omega 3 use to puppy chow last year to help boost brain development in growing dogs.‘Sustainable’ is the second term that is enjoying common usage among English speakers, as well as others.  It was selected as the top word for 2006 by Global Language Monitor. (www.languagemonitor.com) The San Diego based – GLM tracks and analyzes language trends the world over, with a particular emphasis on global English.The Monitor said the word sustainable, long considered a ‘green’ term, “has moved into the mainstream and can apply to populations, marriages, agriculture, economies, and the like. It defines sustainable as meaning self generating, the opposite of disposable”.The word reflects very favorably on  Alaska, as its salmon, pollock, halibut and sablefish (black cod) fisheries are internationally certified as models for sustainable management practices.  Alaska’s cod and flounder fisheries are also in the ‘eco-label’ pipeline.Food forecasters predict that along with “sustainable,” words like “organic” and “local” will continue to be big buzzwords, and we will hear more about “foods with a conscience,” like fair trade coffees and chocolates. The most frequently used English word on the planet? ‘OK.’Selenium nixes mercury scares Fish rich in selenium neutralizes mercury and reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Along with the more well known Omega 3’s, seafood has some of the highest levels of a mineral called selenium than any other foods. (Per ounce only Brazil nuts have more.)Selenium is essential to good health – and it is a major overlooked factor in the ongoing debate over mercury and fish.  Studies show that selenium is present in deep-water fish at five to 20 times the concentration of mercury. And when the two chemicals bind, methyl mercury appears to be neutralized.  Research by Dr. Nicholas Ralston at the Univ. of North Dakota found that the most popular fish eaten by Americans – including salmon, pollock, tuna and flounders – all contain much more selenium than mercury. In fact, all ocean fish are rich in selenium, with the exception of shark.            Ralston was widely reported in the fish press last week, claiming that eating more fish rich in selenium and Omega 3s — especially pregnant women and nursing mothers — can only benefit developing babies. (See “Mercury-Fighting Mineral in Fish Overlooked”.)Selenium is also credited with substantially reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, which stems from plaque build-up that destroys brain cells. That was the conclusion of a nine-year study in France, and more recently, in a study of 2,000 elderly Chinese by researchers from the Indiana University School of Medicine.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 4.5 million Americans. Health experts predict the number of cases could reach 16 million by 2050. The cost of caring for Alzheimer patients in the United States now tops $100 billion a year. High selenium intake is also associated with lower risk of hardening of the arteries, and may reduce the risk of cancer.Slurp and learn The Alaska Shellfish Growers Association annual meeting is set for Nov. 2-3 at the UAA Conference Center in Anchorage.

The prices advanced this summer at the docks were for the most part disappointing, but fishermen who receive bonuses based on salmon sales should soon see some extra cash.Sales of Alaska salmon are tracked according to categories, such as fresh or frozen, fillets, roe and canned. Total May through August sales of all Alaska salmon were $380 million, up nine percent from last year ($347 million), according to the 2007 Alaska Salmon Price Report by the Dept. of Revenue.The sales value of fresh Alaska salmon (headed/gutted) increased 22 percent to $81 million. The value of salmon roe jumped from $46 million to $61 million, a 32 percent increase. For salmon fillets (fresh and frozen), the sales value jumped 50 percent, from $26 million to $39 million.The only salmon item that declined in value is canned reds and pinks, which make up the bulk of Alaska’s total harvest. Canned salmon values dropped 20 percent from $72 million to $58 million.The sales season for canned salmon starts in September, and the 2007 pack went into a plugged market. Stacks in warehouses of nearly 1.6 million cases of canned sockeye (48 tall) is believed to be the largest inventory in 20 years, said the ASMI Seafood Market Bulletin.The Bulletin said 62 percent of Bristol Bay’s 30 million sockeye catch went into cans this summer. An even larger harvest is projected there in 2008, meaning the canned red salmon market will be oversupplied for some time. Some relief could come from the weakened value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, notably Europe and Great Britain where canned sockeye is extremely popular.Canned pinks are also facing an oversupply in the market. Alaska processors put up 3.6 million cases of pink salmon this summer from 143 million fish — the third-largest catch on record. Relief could come from lower pink salmon catches projected for 2008. Also, the shift by Alaska seafood processors away from cans to pricier frozen forms is here to stay. The ASMI Bulletin said 50 percent of the 2007 pink salmon catch went into cans, down from 64 percent just three years ago.Bye to ‘butAlaska’s 2007 halibut fishery ended on Nov. 15 and it looks like fishermen hauled in nearly all of the 50 million pounds allowed in this year’s catch limit. Fishermen also hauled in unheard of halibut prices, topping $5 a pound in most major ports.Here’s a sampler: at Kodiak, halibut prices ranged from  $4.50 to $5 per pound. At Homer, where access to a road system serves to sweeten the price, halibut was fetching $5.00 to $5.50/lb. (An increase of more than 50 cents since September.) Halibut prices at Dutch Harbor ticked steadily upward to close the season at $4.25 to $ 4.75. And fresh halibut was “flying off the docks” in Southeast Alaska, where dock prices were reported at $5.10 to $5.45 per pound.Homer retains the title as the nation’s No. 1 halibut port, with 20 percent of the total catch crossing those docks. That’s followed by Kodiak, Seward, Sitka and Dutch Harbor.Fishery managers will announce the 2008 halibut catch numbers in mid January. The Alaska halibut fishery will reopen in early March.Famous salmon becomes compostA project that turns the waste products of famous Copper  River salmon into compost won a $30,000 entrepreneurial award at the Alaska Federation of Natives “Alaska Marketplace” competition.The money will be used to buy a tractor or forklift and more hoppers to hold all the fish scraps, said Kristin Smith, director of the Copper River Watershed Project that operates the compost venture.“We have basically been a hand labor operation. We’ve been slinging fish heads into this big cannery steamer cooker,” she said.The project, now in its fifth year, mixes fish and wood materials to form a rich compost, sold as “Growing Wild.” This year, it produced 24,000 cubic yards of compost – the most ever – and used 6,000 pounds of fish wastes from co-composter, Prime Select Seafoods. Smith said they hope to eventually use all of the gurry produced by that plant.The Watershed Project is also working with Cordova processors to produce fish meal and refined oils for use as bio-diesel.“We don’t have access to natural gas and we have to bring in all our diesel. We have an abundance of fish coming through town and it seems like such a natural way to go.  I think we could burn everything we generate right here,” Smith said.Smart Gear winnersA high-rise trawl net called “the eliminator” took home the $30,000 top prize at this year’s international Smart Gear competition. The contest, sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund, rewards new ideas that help fishermen retain their target catch while letting marine mammals, turtles, birds or small fish swim away.The Eliminator, created by a team of fishermen and University of Rhode Island advisors, uses large mesh openings in the front and underbelly to reduce bycatch of cod in haddock fisheries.“It takes advantage of fish behavior,” said WWF’s Mike Osmond, who announced the winners at Pacific Marine Expo in Seattle.Two runners-up each took home $10,000. Glenn Parsons of the Univ. of Mississippi won for his ‘nested cylinder’ design, which uses light and water flow to reduce bycatch of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. Diego Zevallos of Argentina won for his simple plastic cone that attaches to trawler warp cables to keep sea birds away from the fishing gear.Osmond said the Smart Gear contest “will take a year off to help get all these gears refined and out in the field.”“Nets like the Eliminator belong in the water, not on stage,” said National Fisherman editor Jerry Fraser, urging more cooperation by fishery managers.

The roe item, set to hit supermarket shelves throughout Japan, also marks an amazing milestone — it is the 1,000th seafood item to earn that eco-distinction.Ten years ago the London-based MSC created its program to certify fisheries that meet strict management and environmental guidelines. Seafood products bearing the blue MSC brand provide a competitive edge for wild seafood in many world markets.Demand for eco-seafood items has been explosive in recent years, fuelled by pledges from huge buyers like Wal-Mart and Disney to only purchase seafoods that come from well managed fisheries. One hundred seafood products merited the MSC label in 2004. By February of 2007 the number reached 500, then quickly doubled, said Brad Ack, MSC Regional Director for the Americas.“It took 7 years to get to the 500th product. Then nine months later it went to 1,000,” Ack said.“It just shows that this is a concept that is really taking off.”The MSC program responds to people’s concerns over food safety, Ack said, combined with increasing awareness of their impact on the natural world and a desire to take better care of our planet.“So all of these consumers are putting more pressure on companies to be as environmentally responsible as possible. The MSC brand and fishery certifications are tools companies can use to respond to consumers. That’s a big part of what’s driving this. And I think there will be continued demands for a very high standard on how food gets to their table.”Purchasing eco-labeled seafood products has become the business standard for entry into European supermarkets and restaurants. Ack said the first MSC labeled item – an Alaska salmon and egg sandwich – has debuted on the menus of upscale eateries. A taste of sustainable seafood is also being served for lunch at 1,000 schools throughout Britain as part of the MSC’s “Fish and Kids” program.So far just 24 of the world’s fisheries have obtained the MSC label. Thirty four are undergoing assessment and about 30 others are preparing to enter the certification process.“We’re just at the tip of the ice berg,” Ack said.Alaska provides the bulk of the world’s eco-fisheries — salmon, pollock, halibut, sablefish and cod caught by the Bering Sea longline fleet all bear the MSC label, and more cod and flounder fisheries are in the pipeline.

According to the Asia Pulse, the Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization (CSIRO) announced completion of the so called ‘Argo’ program last week in Tasmania. Australian scientists deployed 144 of the world’s first Argos between Australia and Indonesia in 1999.The robots will be able to probe oceans that have never been measured before due to their remoteness and stormy conditions.The four foot tall Argo deep sea divers measure temperature and salinity in the upper mile and a half of oceans around the globe, and surface every 10 days to upload the data to a satellite. The information is then analyzed by climate data canters in France and California.The information has already helped researchers track how fast and where the ocean is warming due to greenhouse gases, and aided in ocean-forecasting. Scientists said the Argo project willallow them to solvesome of the big climate questions, as well as provide insight into how the ever-changing ocean weather affects marine ecosystems.The $905 million project is funded by 26 countries. The report said the U.S. has committed to maintaining half of the robots for the next four years, withother contributing countries covering the remainder.Maggot mix makes fishmealTake mounds of manure, add flies and fish guts – and you end up with a maggot based meal that’s snapped up by farmed fish. It sounds gross, but the Associated Press reports that scientists from Idaho universities have developed a new maggot-based fish feed that also removes manure and fish wastes.Idaho is America’s largest producer of farmed rainbow trout, valued at more than $35 million annually. And with a half million cows, it’s the nation’s fourth-biggest dairy state. But along with all those cows come nearly 30 billion pounds of poop. With fish meal prices skyrocketing to $1,400 a ton and mountains of manure piling up, Idaho researchers aimed to create something cheaper that also eats up tons of dung and fish guts in the process.To the rescue — black soldier flies, used widely in Asia to eat restaurant wastes. In tests by animal waste management engineers, the flies quickly reduced 700 buckets of cow manure by half, and seeded it with their eggs. Two months later, fish guts from local farms were added to the brew to enrich the maggots with omega fatty acids. Then they were cleaned, frozen, ground up and fed to rainbow trout in test stations along the Snake River.The fish gobbled up the feed, which made sense to the scientists since flies are a more natural food than corn and soybean meals.Commercial fish feed producers said they were intrigued by the maggot/ omega enhanced fish meal. Waste engineers believe it could become an important niche industry for Idaho’s dairy farmers, who can count on their cows to produce 30 billion pounds of manure each year.<COL>Demand for eco-seafood blooms<COL>2007-11-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/12/ice-saves-salmon-price/<COL>Ice saves salmon priceLaine WelchFishermen believe they have a magic bullet to help turn Bristol Bay sockeye salmon into a more profitable fishery —  it’s called ice.Bristol Bay is Alaska’s most valuable salmon fishery, and nearly all of the catch is sockeye (reds). However, the fish fetch far less than reds from other Alaska regions, and most of the Bristol Bay salmon ends up cans. This year 62 percent of the 30 million sockeye salmon caught in the Bay went into cans, adding to an already oversupplied market. At a disappointing 62 cents a pound, the fishery was worth $106 million to Bay fishermen, down from $108 million in 2006.“Right now, the only way a seafood company can make money is if they own a can line. Because there are so many bad fish coming out of Bristol Bay, you can’t possibly freeze them and make money on those fish,” said Mark Buckley, a 30-year Bay fisherman and board member of the region’s newly formed Regional Seafood Development Association (RSDA).Why the lower quality fish? Nearly 80 percent of the Bay boats are ‘dry’ — meaning they don’t chill their fish.“It’s a no-brainer. You can get up to 10 cents a pound more if you deliver chilled fish.  Bristol Bay is way, way behind the rest of the state,” Buckley said.The RSDA aims to start turning that around next summer. It was formed two years ago when 1,730 driftnet permit holders voted to pay a one percent tax on their salmon catches to fund the venture. They now have nearly $2 million in their coffers and the first goal is to chill every fish caught by the drift fleet — including the many older, smaller boats that can’t accommodate or afford fancy refrigeration systems.“Our solution in this case is ice,” Buckley said. “We can facilitate and partner with others to get ice delivered hopefully to the entire fleet.”Ultimately, the better quality product will attract more buyers who will compete for the fish.“That is the only way we’re going to raise our prices,” Buckley said.The RSDA views its efforts as a partnership between fishermen and processors, and Trident and Leader Creek Seafoods are participating, he said.“We are a seafood development association, not a price negotiation association,” Buckley emphasized. “We’re not there to try and force the processors to pay us more money. We are here to partner with industry to raise the value of Bristol Bay salmon.  The region is undergoing a lot of hardship due to the downturn in salmon prices. If we can raise the prices and value of the catch, we can all help turn that economy around.”The Bristol Bay RSDA five-year strategic plan is posted at www.bbrsda.com. Bristol Bay is only the second of 12 potential Alaska regions that has embraced the RSDA concept, following Prince William Sound/Copper River.Money time!The call is out for hundreds of workers for Alaska’s biggest fisheries that begin in January — pollock, cod and snow crab.“It’s the money-making season in the seafood industry,” said Nelson San Juan, a seafood employment specialist with the state Department of Labor in Anchorage.Major seafood companies need workers at shore plants in Kodiak, King Cove, Dutch Harbor, False Pass and aboard the at-sea fleet. Most of the work will run into April and workers can then be deployed to other fisheries, such as roe herring at Togiak. San Juan added that more processors have told him they will be buying herring at Bristol Bay next spring.Most of the seafood jobs are for cutting, canning or freezing fish. But it sets the stage for training and advancement into skilled jobs that pay decent wages and don’t demand a college degree.“Jobs like maintenance machinists, mechanics, refrigeration, electricians, quality control… There are lots of opportunities for Alaskans in the seafood industry and they may not realize it,” said job specialist Laurie Fuglvog.More seafood companies strive to promote from within, added San Juan.“One thing I like about the seafood industry in is they have been promoting from within. They will announce job advancements in the company before they hire people from outside. And they all are very good at that,” he said.Hiring begins this week.

The fee, which can range from one to three percent, is based on the dock price paid to fishermen and averaged across the state.“This year’s average price for halibut was $4/lb and $2/lb for black cod. That compares to averages of $3.71/lb and $2.45/lb from last year,” said Troie Zuniga, fee coordinator for NOAA Fisheries Restricted Access Management Division in Juneau. Based on this year’s fee of 1.2 percent (up from one percent in 2006) the combined fisheries yielded $2.7 million for coverage costs.“For halibut, the overall value is $172 million and about $62 million for black cod. That’s $21 million lower than the 2006 halibut value and $13 million lower for black cod,” Zuniga said.The fish prices were higher across the board this year so why the lower values? NOAA Fisheries collects data only through September so the highest prices paid at the end of the season in mid-November are not included, said Acting Program Manager Jessie Gharrett. The prices are not based on fish ticket data, and the estimates are only applicable to determining the cost recovery fees, she said.“We collect information only from shoreside processors and the value is applied to the total fishery harvest. Unfortunately, those processors do not receive all the fish harvested. There are catcher processors and others sell their catch on the dock. These persons are not required to report to us,” Zuniga added.Bills were mailed last week to 2,381 Alaska longliners, down from 2,500 last year. Deadline to pay is January 31st.Information is a bit sketchier for shareholders of Bering Sea crab. Federal figures show the total fishery value for crab for the 2005-2006 seasons was $127 million. Crabbers paid a 3-percent fee to the feds totaling $3.9 million in fishery coverage costs.<COL>Ice saves salmon price<COL>2007-12-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2007/11/fish-need-space-in-farm-bill/<COL>Fish need space in Farm billLaine WelchAmerica’s fishermen are getting the brush off from federal lawmakers as they retool the nation’s biggest food bill.The laws in the 2007 U.S. Farm Bill, which governs and bankrolls our nation’s food growers and feeding programs, are revised by Congress every five years. The version they are preparing to pass this year leaves farmers of the sea and wild-caught fish off the list.“Wild fish does not qualify as an agricultural product,” said Bruce Schactler of Kodiak, a fisherman turned expert at finding language in federal laws that plays against Alaska’s salmon industry.“Therefore, in the eyes of the USDA, wild fish is not an agricultural product so we don’t qualify for marketing programs, infrastructure and operating loans, and all kinds of things that support the food producers in the U.S. —  including farmed fish,” he added.Schactler said the problem stems from official language that states agricultural products must be produced in a “controlled environment.”“The original Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937 included fish, but ‘controlled environment’ language was added in the 1960s. We’re trying to get that changed,” he said.Schactler, who works as a fisheries specialist with the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, said getting wild fish included in the Farm Bill is a top priority of Alaska’s congressional delegation.“We don’t want anything special, and we’re not trying to take anything from anybody,” Schactler said. “But we are no different from the guy who’s selling farmed catfish or sugar beets. We are all food producers and we just want to be on equal footing.”Reforms to the Farm Bill failed in the House, which passed off its version to the U.S. Senate in July. Many are critical that it contains no substantive changes to the current system of programs and subsidies that favor large corporate growers of corn, wheat and soybeans. A revealing article by Time Magazine (Nov. 12, “Down on the Farm”) shows that 3/4 of all government subsidies go to just 10 percent of U.S. farms. North Dakota, Texas and Iowa rake in the most cash. California — the state that produces more than half of the nation’s fruits and vegetables — receives just nine percent of federal subsidies.“Americans have begun to ask why the farm bill is subsidizing high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils at a time when rates of diabetes and obesity among children are soaring,” said Randy Hartnell of Vital Choice Seafood.The best, and perhaps last, hope of getting wild fish included in the Farm Bill lies in a bi-partisan Senate amendment called the FRESH Act (S. 2228), Hartnell said.  (FRESH stands for Farm, Ranch, Equity, Stewardship and Health.)The Bush Administration’s 2007 farm bill would spend $10 billion less than the 2002 farm bill.Just add oilThe Oiled Fishermen for S.552 group hopes to get the Exxon tax relief law sponsored by Senator Lisa Murkowski tagged on to the Farm Bill. The Oiled group has helped convince Sens. Cantwell and Murray (Wash.), and Sen. Gordon Smith (Ore.) to co-sponsor the bill and support is building for the one time tax break, said Oiled spokesman Frank Mullen.“It would allow us to put part of any income we are finally awarded from the 1989 Exxon Valdez lawsuit into an IRA, or to choose income averaging. It is not that we want to avoid paying taxes or expect special favors from the government,” Mullen said.There are 33,000 Exxon claimants still alive in Alaska, 5,278 are in Washington, 1,289 claimants in Oregon and 1,448 in California, he said.

Numbers just released by the state reflect the statewide averages and do not include bonuses or post season adjustments after all the fish sales are made.Early estimates show Chinook salmon fetched $2.68/lb at the docks, compared to $3.03 last year. (Winter kings are still being caught in Southeast and prices have more than doubled.) Prices for sockeye salmon dropped by one penny to 76 cents a pound. Sockeye prices dipped or remained the same in all regions except Kodiak, where they increased from 84 cents to 91 cents.Coho salmon prices took a big dive to 83 cents, down from $1.04 last year. Pinks bumped up a penny to 16 cents. Chums dropped 2 cents, averaging 30 cents at the docks.Alaska’s 2007 fishery produced 212 million salmon, the fourth-largest since statehood. The estimated value of $374 million is an increase of nearly $28 million from 2006.Expo growsHundreds of Alaskans are heading to Seattle this week to attend the Pacific Marine Expo. Now in its 41st year, Expo is bucking a downsizing trend in trade shows and has actually expanded to one of its largest shows ever.“We have 440 companies participating and 64,000 feet of exhibit space. That’s an increase of 3,000 feet. Business is up for everyone and vendors are looking happy,” said Bob Callahan, show director for Diversified Business Communications, which produces Expo.Expo was “rebranded” a few years ago to include all aspects of the commercial marine industry – fishing boats, workboats, tugs, barges and passenger vessels.Callahan said a goal is “to liven up the show floor by each day have something new going on.” Some notables: winners of the $50,000 Smart Gear competition, galley cooking demos, Fishermen’s Rodeo, “Deadliest Catch” captains roundtable, and the U.S. Coast Guard will award several fishing boats for their help during the May rescue effort of the cruise ship “Empress of the North” at Icy Strait.

The IPHC also oversees British Columbia’s halibut fishery. The suggested U.S. catch of 59 million pounds means six million pounds less of the popular fish will be crossing the docks.The industry was anticipating the drop. Starting two years ago, IPHC scientists began assessing the Pacific halibut stocks as a single coast wide unit instead of by separate regions, as they have been doing for the past two decades. New information from tagging programs showed greater movement of adult halibut than previously believed.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the Pacific halibut catch, and managers are recommending a 50-million pound harvest next year. That’s a drop of two million pounds from the 2007 catch limit. The biggest hits could be felt in the regions that supply most of the fish — especially to the fresh markets.For Southeast Alaska, a catch of 6.2 million pounds would be a 27 percent reduction. For the Central Gulf, which includes the top ports of Homer, Kodiak and Seward, a catch of 24 million pounds reflects a drop of 7.6 percent. Halibut catches in the Western Gulf, Aleutians and Bering Sea could see a slight boost next year.Along with next year’s catches, the IPHC will also consider several management changes to the fishery. The Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association is asking that the first Saturday in March be set as the opening date for the next three years. Two proposals request expanding the use of vessel monitoring systems to allow fishermen to report their catches from distant waters. Another asks for a ban on electric or hydraulic reels by sport fish operators.The IPHC will make its decisions during the week of January 15th at its annual meeting in Portland, Oregon.

The Com Fish division has 30 offices and six vessels scattered around the state, and total staff of 800. Director John Hilsinger said the merit awards help far flung Com Fish staff feel more connected.“A lot of our staff don’t really know each other, or what goes on in other areas. So it’s a way to recognize them and also to make them feel like they are part of the whole state organization,” Hilsinger said.The awards are also a good way to draw attention to careers in fisheries management, which is a tough sell.“We have had a difficult time recruiting in recent years, especially finding people who want to work in commercial fisheries. In a lot of sectors, I think commercial fisheries are viewed in a negative light with all the bad press on how fisheries will be gone in 40 years because of over harvests,” he added. “So we’ve really tried to put a positive light on the management system that exists in Alaska, and the great job we do here so that we can attract people who want to be part of managing commercial fisheries.”Adding to the recruitment problem, Hilsinger said, is lower paychecks.“I think we have a reputation as a good place to work,” he said. “What hurts us is our salaries are lower than federal agencies and some in the private sector.”The Com Fish division is especially interested in attracting more Alaskans from rural regions.“We’ve been successful in some areas, especially Southeast and Western Alaska in developing partnerships with local Native organizations where they do a lot of the hiring, and local people work on our projects,” Hilsinger said. “One of the points I try to make is how important these fisheries are to the economy of coastal Alaska, and how it’s really an opportunity for them to be a part of maintaining that lifestyle. And it’s one of the only things that allows people to continue to live in their rural communities.”The Commercial Fisheries division is accepting names for 2007 achievers through Saturday.

On Jan. 1, boats using hook and line, pot and jig gear begin plying the icy waters of the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea for cod, rockfish and other groundfish. Then on Jan. 20, trawlers take to the seas to target Alaska pollock, the world’s largest food fishery.Late February or early March sees the start of the eight-month halibut and sablefish (black cod) seasons. March also marks the start of Alaska’s roe herring circuit, usually at Sitka Sound, followed by fisheries for several months all the way to Norton Sound.And although wild king salmon are available nearly year round thanks to Southeast trollers, mid-May marks the “official” start and hoopla of Alaska’s salmon season with the runs of kings and reds at Copper River. Salmon fisheries from Ketchikan to Kotzebue take center stage all summer and into the fall. That’s followed by mid-October openers for Bering Sea crab fisheries. And so it goes. Close to 5 billion pounds of fish and shellfish cross Alaska’s docks each year, valued at over $1 billion.Tanner crab, tooAs the winter snow crab fishery in the Bering Sea kicks into high gear, crabbers and processors last week compromised on a $1.58 per pound base price, down four cents from the original asking price.“Obviously, more will be paid when the crab is sold,” said Greg White, negotiator for the crabbers’ Inter Cooperative Exchange (ICE), which represents about 70 percent of the king and snow crab caught in the Bering Sea.The 2008 snow crab quota is 63 million pounds, nearly double last year’s catch.“We think there was a better price to be had, but like the processors, we’re eager to go fishing and get the crab caught,” White said.Alaska crabbers want to get the jump on the giant Eastern  Canada fishery, which begins in April and produces nearly 200 million pounds of snow crab for U.S. and overseas markets. Alaska provides roughly 10 percent of the world’s snow crab.Tanner crab, two: Kodiak crabbers can drop pots for bairdi Tanner crab starting each year in mid January. At an average weight of 2.5 – 3 pounds, bairdi is the larger cousin of the better-known opilio Tanners, or snow crab. Kodiak’s quota dipped this year to just a half million pounds of bairdi crab, but strong year classes are poised to enter the fishery in the near future.“We’re seeing strong pulses that are very wide spread, not just around Kodiak, but further south along the Peninsula and at Chignik as well. So it’s very promising for fisheries a couple of years down the road,” said fishery manager Nick Sagalkin.Managers said high prices for pot cod means less interest in the local crab fishery, and fewer than 50 boats could participate. Nearly all of the bairdi crab is sold to Japan, which is a very discerning market.“The key to the bairdi market in Japan is that when it is clean and large and bright colored, it’s a wonderful premium crab product and people are very excited to get it,” said industry expert John Sackton of www.seafood.com.Managers said most of the Kodiak crab has been looking really good in recent years. That’s not the case for Bering Sea bairdi, which has seen a mix of sizes and off-colors since the fishery reopened in 2005 after a seven-year closure. The catch has been ratcheting upwards to five million pounds this year.“It is like a developmental fishery. When the Japanese first heard it was open again everyone was excited because they had visions of what they had 10 years ago. That didn’t material and there’s been a lot of variability,” Sackton said. “So far the growing conditions in the Bering Sea have not been totally ideal, so the stock is still kind of feeling its way.”Still, Bering Sea crabbers are averaging $1.62 a pound for bairdi, up from $1.29 last year. Kodiak crabbers averaged $1.78 a pound last year, up from $1.40 in 2006.  If the crab is still looking good, Sackton predicts it will find a ready market.“It’s not something that’s really sold that much under its own name in the US market because it hasn’t been available in big quantities. So it tends to be a specialized market. But I think there are very good prospects for crab of top quality. That’s the key – and if the Kodiak crab is bright and clean, it will be a high value premium crab.”Seafood futures: An economic squeeze is taking its toll on the seafood trade but demand at home and abroad is keeping business afloat. But profits this year may be another story, as the U.S. economy flirts with recession, said Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley.  Dwindling supplies of some favorites could force steep price increases for seafood compared to competing proteins, like chicken and beef.Wholesale prices for all commodities saw a nine percent increase last year. High-energy costs are expected to fuel another three percent rise in consumer prices in 2008.Wholesale fish prices gained 11 percent last year, with flounder and cod prices up more than 20 percent, pollock up nearly 7 percent and halibut up almost 6 percent. Conversely, crab prices dropped by nearly 13.5 percent. Fresh fish saw the biggest gains at retail counters, up nearly 6 percent, thanks to sales of salmon, halibut and groundfish.Frozen seafood prices saw a 3.6 percent increase last year, compared to just two-tenths of a percent in 2006. The USDA predicts that overall, seafood prices will advance 3.5 percent this year.A nosedive in the value of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a big factor in the fish business, Talley said. At year’s end the dollar depreciated 6 percent against the Chinese yuan and 5 percent against the Euro. Economist Gunnar Knapp at the University of Alaska-Anchorage said for now that is playing in our favor.“It’s good news when the dollar drops – it strengthens foreign demand for seafood and will help increase buyer interest and bid up the price for those markets,” Knapp said.The same wisdom does not apply to Japan, still one of Alaska’s most important seafood customers. Economists predict the value of the dollar will be up 2 percent against the Japanese yen this year.Other fish items of interest: According to the National Restaurant Association, Americans spent 48 percent of their food budget eating out nearly six times each week. Restaurants expect a 3 percent increase in food prices, down from 4.5 percent in 2007. Chefs predict several seafood favorites will retain or gain popularity. The Food Marketing Institute showed that at retail grocery stores, 73 percent feature fresh seafood and 53 percent have sushi stations. Stores are also featuring more seafood offerings for take out and prepared meals for home consumption.<COL>Winter fisheries launch season<COL>2008-01-09<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/01/quota-shares-projected-pricey/<COL>Quota shares projected priceyBy Laine WelchBering Sea crabbers who came up empty in the new quota share program will soon have a chance to own some of the catch.When quota share programs were implemented in Alaska’s halibut, sablefish and Bering Sea crab fisheries, they included a federal loan program designed to let disenfranchised deckhands and skippers buy in. The direct loans are funded by a portion of the fees paid by fishermen to cover management and enforcement costs. Those fees are based on their annual catches.Since 1995 eligible entry level and small boat halibut and sablefish harvesters have availed themselves of the opportunity, which lets them finance up to 80 percent of the cost of purchasing quota shares over 25 years at a fixed, low interest rate.“The funding has been set at $5 million a year for the life of the program, and we’ve committed that full amount each year. So it has been a popular program,” said Leo Erwin, director of Financial Services for NOAA Fisheries.But Bering Sea crabbers have been on hold for the loans since their quota share program hit the water in 2005. So what’s the hold up?“This is the first year there has been an appropriation to authorize the loan program,” Erwin explained.Congress has budgeted $3 million to be used for the so-called Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab Financing Program. That means the feds can begin writing the rules to really get things moving.“We’re moving ahead on publishing and implementing regulations,” Erwin said. “It’s a multi-step process. At this point, we’re hoping to get the first step done, which is the proposed rule, probably in late winter or early spring. We’re looking forward to hearing from the public and getting the program up and running, most likely sometime next year,” Erwin said.“People should keep an eye out for the proposed rule so that we can get as many comments as possible and incorporate those considerations into the final rule,” said Chief Financial Officer Gary Reisner.Neither would estimate how much the additional money might generate in crew loans.“We need to get some experience in the program, and I don’t have a good understanding of what the market is for crab quota. So it is pretty hard to speculate,” Erwin said.One thing is certain — the quota shares will be pricey. Latest prices peg red king crab quota at $28-$30 a pound for the most prime fishing districts, said Jeff Osborn at Dock Street Brokers. Snow crab is in the $10 range, Tanner crab is priced closer to $12 per pound and golden king crab is listed at $7.50-$12 per pound. Osborn said future catch limits, grounds prices and uncertain political developments will dictate the ups and downs in the Bering Sea crab quota market.Fish and the Farm BillWhen Congress gets back to work later this month a committee will align House and Senate versions of the $286 billion Farm Bill. Fishermen want to make sure the final bill includes tax relief from any Exxon oil spill pay outs and first time access to operational loans.Senator Lisa Murkowski championed the Exxon Valdez Tax Treatment as an amendment to the Farm Bill, which would allow income averaging and one-time retirement contributions for those receiving punitive damage awards. Senator Ted Stevens is credited with getting the door opened to fishermen to be included in the Farm Bill’s operational loan program. Similar to other food producers, it would allow fishermen to borrow up to $300,000 in low interest loans from the USDA’s Farm Service Agency.“The Farm Bill right now includes U.S. fish farmers but it does not include fishermen. So it’s very important that wild harvesters pay attention and stay involved in this process,” said Joe Childers, president of United Fishermen of Alaska.Wild fish was included in the original Farm Bill in the 1930’s, said Bruce Schactler, a fishery specialist with the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. “But a change in definitions about 40 years ago has worked against fishermen ever since.”“They defined fish as ‘an aquatic gilled animal that is produced in a controlled environment.’ So farmed fish is considered a farm product that is eligible for USDA programs. But wild fish are not. That is the wrong that Senator Stevens has been trying to correct,” Schactler added.“We want to keep up the pressure on policy makers,” echoed Childers, “but it is just as important  to elevate the awareness that we are very significant food producers and we are not involved in the U.S. Farm Bill at all.”President Bush has threatened to veto the Farm Bill, calling it “too spendy.” Get more information on the US Farm Bill and Congressional contact lists from UFA in Juneau.Halibut catches comin’ upFishermen will find out how this week how much halibut they’ll be able to harvest this year. The International Pacific Halibut Commission is meeting in Portland, Oregon and will decide on catch limits for fisheries in California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and British Columbia.Managers are recommending an Alaska catch of 50 million pounds, a drop of two million pounds from last year. Southeast Alaska fishermen are bracing for a 27 percent cut to their halibut catches to just six million pounds. The IPHC also will consider several management changes, including a request to set the opening date on the first Saturday in March at least for the next three years.

But Congress didn’t complete its work on the federal budget until late December, after Alaska had already completed its spending plan. That means the state didn’t account for the federal cuts, and could come up short.“The latest information we have indicated the cuts will be more severe than we previously thought,” John Hilsinger, director of the state Commercial Fisheries Division said in phone interview.“Right now it looks like we may get total or significant cuts in every grant we receive through NOAA and the Dept. of Commerce.”The shortfall will hit shellfish and groundfish programs especially hard, Hilsinger said.“Our interaction in the council process, management and research and surveys of Bering Sea crab…virtually our entire scallop research program is on these federal funds that are likely to be cut. Also a big part of our rockfish research and stock assessments surveys,” he explained.“There are quite a few federally funded projects on the Yukon,” he added.  “The Pilot Station sonar, subsistence surveys, aerial escapement surveys, and some of the Pacific Salmon Treaty money as well. Research and surveys for near shore geoducks, sea urchins and shrimp fisheries will also suffer.”Also on the chopping block: a loss of $400,000 to the Sportfish Division and nearly $2 million for marine mammal research, Tkacz reported.Hilsinger said there has been a “sympathetic response” from the state Office of Management and Budget and legislators and ADF&G will “get increments into the governor’s revised budget within a few weeks.”“All of these programs and all the staff are very important and we are going to do everything we can to protect them.”Attack on coastal carnageAlaskans are gathering to plan an all out war on marine debris that is befouling coastlines from Ketchikan to Barrow.“There is a growing recognition that it poses a threat to fish and wildlife, threats of entanglement to seals and marine mammals, and it’s a problem to humans as well,” said Bob King, program coordinator for the MCA Foundation, co-sponsor with Alaska Sea Grant of a two day workshop at the Alaska Forum for the Environment next month in Anchorage.“There are a lot of community efforts going on. The idea is to bring everyone together, to better coordinate and to talk about some of the broader issues such as recycling these materials,” King said.The Alaska Brewing Company, for example, contributes one percent of all Alaska IPA beer sales to a program called Coastal CODE (Clean Oceans Depend on Everyone), and sends cash and “brew crews” to help communities clean up local coastlines.“Whenever a local nonprofit is interested in a clean up, we like to be involved as much as we can,” said project manager Heather Conlin at the Juneau-based brewery. The crews helped remove 150 tons of debris last year and has expanded its program to California, Conlin added.The MCA Foundation projects picked up 171 tons of debris last year from Southeast to Norton Sound, King said.  Most of it ends up in landfills, which in itself poses costly problems.“In Dutch Harbor the landfill has some 10,000 tons of old nets, and it accumulates by another 1,000 tons each year,” he said.King said the upcoming workshop will look at recycling alternatives, such as converting the plastic nets back into its petroleum base, then burning it as diesel fuel as they are doing in Hawaii.Meanwhile, he says marine debris is drawing national headlines.“Like the famous North Pacific garbage patch where all this material gets caught in oceanic gyres and accumulates in the middle of the ocean. It’s is so big it is even a hazard to navigation,” he said.The Marine Debris in Alaska Workshop is set for February 14-15 at the Egan Convention Center in Anchorage and is open to the public.

At $4.65 a gallon for diesel,  they simply can’t afford to go fishing.“The cost of fuel comes off the top of the trip. Then we have observer fees, gear and  maintenance costs, insurance. It’s just reached the breaking point. And the price of fuel keeps going up,” said Jeff Scott, skipper of the 86-foot fishing vessel Dusk.“For our last delivery we grossed $12, 546. The fuel cost was $7,000.  Over 60% for fuel,” lamented Al Burch, Dusk owner and director of the Alaska  Draggers Association.The months of April through June are the prime fishing months for arrowtooth flounder, rock sole and other flatfish in the Gulf of Alaska. Normally, the fisheries provide between 35-45 percent of the Dusk’s annual income, Scott said. But fish prices have remained constant for two years, while diesel costs have increased by more than 40 percent.So far the tie-up means a loss of 10 million pounds of flatfish to Kodiak, Burch said, as well as down time for the resident seafood processing workforce.“Every three days that the Dusk doesn’t make a trip puts 160-170 processing workers out of work. That’s just one boat – multiply that by six boats,” he said.Jeff Scott said fishermen aren’t blaming the local buyers for not upping flatfish prices.“In most cases they have already pre-sold the fish as frozen blocks. Their overhead is going up too and they’re stuck,” he said.We’re scratching our heads over what to do,” added Al Burch. “Boy, it sure is discouraging.”That was echoed in Cordova where the cost of diesel  fuel by the town’s single supplier was $4.38 per gallon, said fisherman Brent Davis.Last month he began jigging for cod with his salmon boat, but had to give up after two trips.“Since no one else is doing it here, I had to do some prospecting. But the fuel costs exceed what I am willing to spend,” Davis said.“I know that jigging for cod could be a viable fishery in Prince William Sound,” he added. ‘As a small time salmon fisherman who wants to expand into other fishing opportunities, I feel pinched by petroleum and will leave the cod to swim.”Fuel costs are “the biggest concern” for Cordovan Rick Ballas, who fishes for salmon and halibut.“If fish prices stay the same it’s easy to calculate the additional impact rising fuel costs will have. It will come directly from my pocket, which is not very deep or big, for that matter,” Ballas said.By last week the average price of diesel had topped $4 per gallon, according to a AAA nationwide survey of 80,000 fuel providers, and prices are expected to increase.Ballas said fishermen should receive “fuel breaks” from the federal government, similar to other food producers.“If nothing is done to reduce fuel costs for commercial operators in general, it will be the American people who will feel the impacts the most in the end,” he added.“I seem to recall that farmers and fishermen receive a special federal tax break on fuel. Does the State have a similar rate deduction for those who need fuel for their commercial enterprises?  If not, the issue might be worth bringing up to the next Legislature,” suggested Phil Smith,  a former state and federal fishery management pioneer.Now retired, Smith offered this reflection:  “I think it is absurd that Alaskans individually are suffering from the effects of extraordinarily high fuel prices, while we are collectively enriched beyond any rational expectation by the world price of crude – same phenomenon, same population, but hugely different effects.”Seafood perceptions – The collapse of the West Coast salmon stocks has made headlines in the Pacific Northwest, but it’s not news worthy in the Mid-West.“We hear very little, both in the popular and the trade press, about that issue.  It just doesn’t seem to be hitting the radar screen here,” said Bob Goldin at Technomic, a Chicago-based consulting firm for U.S. restaurants and food suppliers for over 40 years.Consumers don’t regard salmon as “at risk” Goldin said, because “fresh, farmed salmon is all over the place.”“There is the perception that there is tremendous supply available due to advances in aquaculture,” he said.While it is often preferred, Goldin said the high prices for wild salmon limit its market appeal, especially in today’s economy.“You can buy fresh salmon at CostCo for $3-$4 bucks a pound,” he said.Overall, Goldin said the “seafood category” is showing good growth in the food trade, especially salmon. He credits the perceived health benefits, and said users are more comfortable cooking seafood and are menuing it in more ways.Alaska seafood gets high marks for food safety and has a lot of appeal, but “price and stability of supply and availability are always questions and challenges in the seafood business,” Goldin said.Goldin agreed that all segments of the food and transportation chain face huge challenges from rising fuel costs.“I hadn’t really thought of it in terms of commercial fishing,” Goldin said from his Chicago office. “Especially for the small fishermen, the costs for them are prohibitive. It doesn’t even pay for them to go out.”Fuel fact – The diesel fueled internal combustion engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel of France in 1898. Diesel originally conceived the diesel engine to enable independent craftsmen and artisans to compete with large industry, according to historical sources. Diesel’s first engines were built to run on peanut oil for the developing world, which had no petrochemical industry.<COL>High fuel costs strap fleet<COL>2008-04-23<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/01/iphc-lowers-halibut-limits/<COL>IPHC lowers halibut limitsLaine WelchAs expected, less halibut will be crossing the Alaska docks this year. The International Pacific Halibut Commission last week followed the recommendations of its scientists and set a lower Alaska catch limit at just over 50 million pounds, a drop of two million pounds from 2007.Regionally, it reflects some ups and downs for Alaska. Halibut catches in the Western Gulf, Bering Sea and Aleutians were boosted slightly, while the biggest cuts are in the regions that produce most of the fish. The Central Gulf, which includes the ports of Homer, Kodiak and Seward, has a reduced catch of 24 million pounds down nearly 8 percent. For Southeast Alaska, the halibut catch was slashed by 27 percent to just six million pounds.The reduced catches stem from a new way of counting the fish.  Scientists are assessing Pacific halibut stocks as a single, coast wide unit, instead of by separate regions, as they have done for 20 years. Stakeholders knew the reductions were coming, and while they were unhappy about it, they respected the science driving the decision.“No one likes it but we are more concerned about sustaining the resource into the future. We agreed the science supported the need for the cuts,” said Kathy Hansen, a halibut fisherman and spokesperson for the Southeast Alaska Fishermen’s Alliance. Hansen added that the cuts will also be felt by halibut sport charter operators in Southeast – the guideline harvest will drop to 930,000 pounds, down from from the usual 1.43 million pounds.“People recognized that the IPHC staff is doing a phenomenal job of managing the biological part of the fishery and they are not questioning the science,” agreed fishery consultant Linda Kozak.What many are questioning, however, is the way in which the halibut catches are divvied up.“The coast wide assessment was pretty much supported  across the board by the U.S. and Canada as the way to look at setting catch limits, but the apportionment method is under question. People want to have that reviewed and a get a more clear understanding,” Kozak added.The IPHC will schedule a public workshop this fall to show how and why it is apportioning the halibut stocks. The Commission also was urged to provide more analysis on halibut bycatch issues, and to schedule a bycatch workshop next year.“The halibut bycatch information has not been updated since 1991,” Hansen said.Reducing halibut size limits from 32 to 30 inches also was a “hot topic,” Kozak said. The IPHC will do a full review on size limits at its annual meeting next January in Vancouver. The 2008 halibut fishery will open on March 8 and run through mid-November.Alaska 2008 halibut catch limits, in millions of poundsFish futures— Brighter days are ahead for Alaska’s halibut harvesters. Two huge year classes from 1999 and 2000 are poised to enter the fishery – even larger than the record recruits of the late 1980s. Halibut researchers predict the surge of fish should enter the fishery starting in 2010-2015. One red light – Seafood Trend’s Ken Talley said huge and expanding stocks of arrowtooth flounder carpet the ocean floor and compete for the same food supply as halibut. Managers estimate a major change in the Gulf of Alaska marine ecosystem has favored the arrowtooth, growing the stocks from about 900 million pounds in 1970 to nearly 4.5 billion pounds in 2006. Arrowtooth flounders have no predators, nor is there a commercial fishery because the fish flesh turns to mush when it’s heated. The arrowtooth flounder could dominate the Gulf habitat and gobble up most of the food sources, resulting in slower growth for halibut stocks in coming years.Seafood fete – A tasty line up of new Alaska seafood products will be unveiled in Seattle this week at the 15th annual Symphony of Seafood. The Symphony, orchestrated by the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, is designed to showcase new Alaska seafood products and introduce them to the marketplace.Fourteen new seafood entries will be judged on Jan. 23 in three categories: retail, smoked and food service. As usual, the products come from both large and small companies with a focus on ready-made, heart healthy meals, said event organizer Val Motley.In the line up:   Smokey Salmon Salsa from Harley’s Northwest Co.,  Sea Choice Citrus Herb Salmon Perfect Entrée by Ocean Beauty, Trident’s  Natural Mediterranean-Style  Cod  Fillets and Heart Smart, Low Fat Breaded Alaska Pollock. Also: spicy   wild sockeye salmon sausage from Vital Choice Seafoods, Wild   Salmon Wraps by  Anchorage’s Taco Loco, Wild King Salmon Jerky by Trapper’s Creek, and Ray’s Gourmet Wild Salmon Chowder from Borealis Fisheries from far away St. Mary’s.Except for a Seattle People’s Choice award, all winners are always kept secret until the Symphony moves to Anchorage. The winners will be announced at a gala soiree on January 31st at the Anchorage Museum, where seafood fans also get to sample all the products and select an Alaska favorite.All winners receive a trip and booth space at the International Boston Seafood Show in late February.“It’s a great opportunity, especially for the smaller guys, to showcase their products,” Motley said.Find more information at www.symphonyofseafood.com.<COL>IPHC lowers halibut limits<COL>2008-01-23<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/05/counting-crew-members/<COL>Counting crew membersIt’s hard to account for a work force if you don’t know who or where it is.An ambitious new project aims to craft a system that will provide labor data on the thousands of crew members who work aboard Alaska’s fishing fleets.Best ‘guess-timates’ peg the number of deckhands at 20,000. Because fishermen are contract workers, no wage reports are collected by the state. Crew licenses are required, but they don’t tell where or when a crew member fished, how much they earned, or if they even fished at all.“Without that information, communities really don’t have any basis for accurately estimating the effects of fishing.  It makes it difficult for both harvesters and communities to apply for economic assistance or other state and federal programs,” said Mike Catsi, executive director of the Southwest Alaska Municipal League. SWAMC has led initiatives to get fish harvesters counted for several years.The project will use a $150,000 one-time appropriation to develop a system to collect and input the new information into a data base at the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game.  It will be able to use electronic landing reports and fish ticket systems already in place.The first step will be to hire a contractor and begin scoping meetings around the state, said Geron Bruce, deputy director of the state commercial fisheries division.“I want the stakeholders to have an advisory role in what questions we ask, how we shape the study and what outcomes we want.   From the beginning, everyone needs to feel that we are moving forward together with a common purpose,” Bruce said.Two advisory groups will be formed during the summer, Bruce said. One will comprise members of various state agencies; another will include fishing stakeholders representing different regions and gear groups.“We really need to broaden the discussion to include more regions,” said Bruce.  “Basically it has been focused in the Westward Region, particularly dealing with fishery rationalization programs, either existing or proposed ones. For other regions, it’s not even on their radar screen. But it’s going to be a statewide program and will affect everyone.”“Given the wide variety of fisheries and areas around the state, it will take some time to sort through all the issues,” said division director John Hilsinger. “We need a system that works in Bering Sea crab fisheries as well as skiff fisheries on remote rivers.”There is general agreement that the harvester workforce is an important part of the employment and economic picture, and better data is needed. But there is no consensus yet on how, who or where to get it.“Both the State and the fishing industry would be best served to take their time to design a program that works best for everyone,” Bruce said. “It might put a year or more lead time before it is in place, but it will be time well spent.”Solar tenders? – Alaska fishermen, processors and small businesses can benefit from two federal grant programs aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  Nearly $16 million is available nationwide through the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Rural Development Program.One grant helps fund renewable energy projects that include geothermal, biomass, wind and solar energy.  That could be a natural for fishing tenders, said Dean Stewart, program director of the Alaska USDA Rural Development Program.“They could use solar energy or some other type mounted on their vessel while they are anchored up in the fishing grounds rather than using diesel generators.  Solar panels also can power ice machines,” he said.A second grant is designed for energy efficiency projects, such as improving insulation in fish holds or improving fish chilling systems.Both grants cover up to 25 percent of the eligible costs of the project. The maximum grant for renewable energy projects is $500,000 and 250,000 for energy efficiency projects. Deadline to apply is June 16.

Omega 3’s have become one of the most popular food additives due to a whole host of health benefits. Last year, omega-3 fatty acids were added to 250 food products, from eggs to orange juice, and the list is growing fast.National surveys show that baby boomers are very aware of the benefits of omega 3’s and are adding more to their diets. But most young parents don’t know how essential omega’s are to developing babies. According to a Harris Interactive poll of   1,220 U.S. parents, 60 percent were not aware of the benefits of so called DHA omega’s to their children’s health.DHA is one of two key omega 3 fatty acids essential for brain and eye development. It is especially important between birth and five years of age, when the brain increases nearly three-and-a-half times in weight.  Leading authorities recommend 150 milligrams daily for kids aged one through five.Omega-3’s cannot be produced by our bodies and must be obtained from foods. All omegas are not created equal – the critical DHA compound is found only in seafoods, especially wild salmon, or in fish supplements.<COL>Counting crew members<COL>2008-05-07<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/05/fishing-industry-healthcare-plan-flounders/<COL>Fishing industry healthcare plan floundersBy Laine WelchAn innovative new plan to provide healthcare coverage for fishing families could stall due to the sudden illness of Sen. Ted Kennedy.The Massachusetts senator was championing the Commercial Fishing Industry Health Care Coverage Act through Congress this session. Kennedy was diagnosed last week with a malignant brain tumor and is scheduled to begin medical treatments. But hopes remain high, both for his recovery and for passage of the healthcare plan.“It has had no opposition,” said Sen. Ted Stevens, co-sponsor of the bi-partisan plan. “It really is a great bill and I think everyone realizes these people need some assistance.”Stevens called the Act “a new approach” to providing access to healthcare coverage to anyone who performs fisheries-related work.It would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund $50 million in healthcare grants for commercial fishing states or organizations. The money would jumpstart the costs for getting a healthcare coverage plan up and running. It would also be used to offset individual healthcare costs, and provide group insurance coverage for more fishing families. Coverage would extend to boat owners, captains and crew — as well as others performing fishing industry-related work — such as shore-side support company employees and their families.“No subsidies are involved. It’s a partnership,” Sen. Stevens said in a phone conversation. “The legislation would authorize grants to fishing states or organizations that would be required to provide matching funds of $1 for every $2 in federal funding.”Surveys around the country show that fishing families are much more likely to be uninsured than other Americans. The seasonal and dangerous nature of their profession makes affordable coverage hard to find. Most fishermen are self-employed or work for small businesses, and high-priced insurance costs are simply out of reach.Options for both healthcare delivery and insurance are even more limited for Alaskans, according to a survey by the United Fishermen of Alaska (UFA). It revealed that thousands of Alaska fishermen are more likely to work and live in communities without a hospital, while fewer insurance companies offer individual or small business medical coverage in Alaska than in any other state.“This legislation will allow fishermen to band together to purchase group coverage, which will give them an opportunity to get the health care they need,” he said.On a personal note, Stevens said Ted Kennedy has visited Alaska to determine the adequacy of healthcare in rural regions.“In 1969 we took a trip through Native country and from that grew a longstanding relationship,” Stevens said. “He’s been up there several times with me. Politics are politics, but Ted and I have been friends for a long time.”Arctic protectionsAs global warming makes Arctic waters more welcoming to fish stocks, Congress has taken steps to put protections in place. Congress passed a resolution last week asking the State Department to begin developing U.S. policy for the region. That will set the stage for international fisheries management agreements at the United Nations.“There is very little fishing now in the Arctic,” said Sen. Ted Stevens. “Norway has some fisheries, and the bulk of the entry to the Arctic Ocean is in their area. We do not have any commercial fishing on our side, and to the best of my knowledge, neither do the Russians.”The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has already imposed a moratorium on any Arctic fishing until management regimes are in place. Sen. Stevens said the Council will take a lead in developing policy for the Arctic Ocean.“They are already developing ones for the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea, so it naturally follows for them to be involved,” he said.Jim Ayers, director of the conservation group Oceana, praised the Alaska delegation and Senator Stevens especially “for leading the United States and the world in protecting the Arctic in the face of climate change and rapid industrialization.”Dangerous jobs updateThe latest federal labor figures for 2006 show that Alaska regained the No. 1 rank for having the highest rate of work-related deaths in the nation.Alaska had lost the “worst” title for four years after 2001, with Wyoming and Montana jockeying for first place. But in 2006, Alaska had 45 workplace deaths, up from 29 fatalities in 2005. Commercial fishing still ranked as the nation’s most hazardous occupation from 2001 through 2006, with an average fatality rate of 115 deaths per 100,000 fishermen.But Alaska waters are not the most deadly. That distinction goes to the West Coast states of California, Oregon and Washington, whose combined fishing fatalities totaled 238 deaths — more than double the rate of Alaska and the nation.  The deadliest catch comes from the Dungeness crab fishery — with 17 on-the-job deaths.The results of a report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), showed a lack of use of life rafts and survival suits by West Coast fishermen.  Conversely, emergency preparedness and training is credited with boosting survival rates significantly among Alaska fishermen.“Alaska has had the biggest improvement in fishing safety than any other place in the country,” said Jerry Dzugan, director of the Sitka-based Alaska Marine Safety Education Association.  “We’ve gone done from almost 40 fatalities a year in the early 1980s, to an average now of about 11 in the past five years. So that’s a huge drop.”The NIOSH report said the fishing industry and government agencies can learn a lot from initiatives taken in Alaska, and that safety inspections, training and good emergency gear can reduce deaths in West Coast fisheries and nationwide.<COL>Fishing industry healthcare plan flounders<COL>2008-05-28<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/04/laws-r-us/<COL>Laws ‘R’ UsBy Laine welchThe 2008 Alaska legislative session might be a (near) wrap, but several new “fish laws” are still moving at a good clip through Congress.One is aimed at improving the safety of seafood surging into the U.S. from foreign countries.“This bill will deal with about 80 percent of the seafood consumed by Americans, because it is imported seafood,” said Sen. Ted Stevens, (R-AK) a co-sponsor of the bi-partisan bill. “We’ve had enormous increases in imports, but strangely enough, we only inspect about 1.6 percent of that seafood.”Seafoods from foreign aquaculture operations (mostly farmed shrimp, salmon and tilapia) often are not held to the same health and environmental standards as U.S. producers.“Some of this is full of all kinds of crap. It is not fit for consumption,” Stevens said in a phone conversation from Washington,  D.C.The seafood safety bill would expand the authority of NOAA and U.S. Food and Drug agents to test and track imported seafood as it is distributed throughout the U.S. FDA agents also will have authority to inspect foreign seafood operations and facilities. Funding for the seafood safety program has been authorized at $15 million through 2013.Agents already are in Chile inspecting its farmed salmon industry, according to the Pew Environmental Group. The FDA will gather data on chemical use in five fish farms and assess Chile’s overall operations, a press release said.“In contrast with Norway and Scotland, Chile has not been forthcoming with adequate data on the amount of antibiotics, anti-foulants and other chemicals used in its operations. The public needs to know,” said Andrea Kavanagh, an aquaculture specialist and Pew spokesperson.Last year Chile sent over 250 million pounds of farmed salmon to U.S. markets, and only 40 samples were tested by the FDA, a Pew report said.Stop fish pirates! Another new law aims to stop illegal fishing on the high seas, a piracy valued at $9 billion annually. The International Fisheries Stewardship & Enforcement Act of 2008, introduced last week by Senators Stevens and Dan Inouye (D-HI), would tighten U.S. laws, and ban products from illegal, under reported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries from entering this country.“These huge vessels the size of battleships fish on the high seas, then dump it in various places. They know what they are doing is illegal, and they try to convince the world they have the right to fish outside the 200 mile limit using any method they choose,” Stevens said. “We want to send a strong message to the world that these vessels and fish products are not welcome in U.S. ports and we hope other nations will follow suit.”Stevens said he is working with the U.N. and hopes to get global support to stop IUU fishing this fall.“The world did not take any action against high seas driftnets until we did it. Same for the 200 mile limit. We went to the U.N. and asked them to follow us and they did. Now we’re going to do the same thing with IUU fisheries.”Senator Stevens said curtailing IUU fishing is especially important to protect waters of the Arctic Ocean, which are expanding from global warming and can be entered from many regions.Stevens said he is optimistic that IUU, seafood safety  and other “fish laws” will be passed by Congress. “Most of these will not have to be debated. They will be worked out on a consent agreement, and I think these bills should go very quickly,” Stevens said. “Also, we have built strong bi-partisan support. That has made things work out much more easily.”Farmers of the sea – It appears the keepers of the U.S. Farm Bill have finally opened the door a crack to America’s fishermen. (U.S. fish farmers have long been eligible for subsidies and other federal programs and benefits.)“The House indicates it is going along with my amendment that allows the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture to make loans to small commercial fishermen, the same way they make loans to small farmers,” Senator Stevens said.“This will help the next generation of fishermen be able to get long term, low interest loans to help with purchases of vessels and permits and operating expenses,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska. “The fleet is graying – and to continue sustainable fisheries, the first thing we need to sustain is the occupation.”Also tagged onto the Farm Bill is a measure by Sen. Lisa Murkowski that will help reduce the tax burden to Exxon award recipients.Another bill coming before lawmakers this week is the Commercial Fishing Industry Health Care Coverage Act. It would provide $50 million in matching grants to states or organizations to jump start health care programs for fishing industry families.“Alaska’s delegation can’t go it alone. Any coastal senators should be hearing from their fishermen in support of fishermen’s health care,” said UFA’s Vinsel. “If they are not hearing from us, then we can’t expect anything from them. But we need them to help support our industry.”Tattle-tale Trash – To provide a ‘global snapshot of the trash problem out on the water,’ the environmental group Ocean Conservancy organized an International Coastal Cleanup day last September.  Nearly 400,000 volunteers scoured 33,000 miles of shoreline in 76 countries and in 45 U.S. states. In all, they picked up 6 million pounds of trash in one day from world beaches.The volume of the trash tells only part of the story. To learn how people were behaving around or on the water, the Conservancy cataloged the collected trash into more than 7 million items. In all, 57 percent of the trash came from 2 million food wrappings, containers, cups, plates and plastic eating utensils and 1.2 million bottles and beverage cans. Thirty three percent of the ocean trash came from smokers. Beach combers and divers collected 2.3 million cigarette butts, filters and cigar tips. It reveals a “general carelessness” about what’s being tossed into the water, the Conservancy concluded in a report released last week on Earth Day.

The Mat-Su district was the first to add the item to its school menus in March, and the Kenai Peninsula followed suit last month at the 28 schools in its district.“We feel it’s so important to offer an occasional Alaska salmon portion to our students, even though it costs 10-15 cents more than a hamburger or slice of pizza,” said Dean Hamburg, director of Student Nutrition Services for the school district. Kenai schools serve 900,000 meals in a typical school year, he said.“Here on the Kenai Peninsula, it’s also a matter of pride because we see ourselves as a real home of red salmon,” Hamburg added. “It’s important to extend that community cultural tie to the school lunch plate.”The average cost for a school lunch for kindergarten through eighth grade is about $3.60, with 53 percent going to labor and the balance for food costs. That leaves about $1.80 to cover all the food that goes onto a school lunch tray, Hamburg explained.The 2.5 ounce salmon wraps are produced by Taco Loco of Anchorage, and modeled after a larger 8 oz. version already popular at several retail outlets.“Tortilla wraps are all the rage and there’s a big push toward more nutritious foods, but no one was featuring fish,” said Adam Galindo, co-owner/operator of Taco Loco, a family business begun by his parents in 1974. “Fish is Alaska’s bread and butter and we’re an Alaska company, so we decided to do something about it.”The Galindos pitched the salmon wraps directly to the Mat-Su and Kenai school districts and used feedback from kids’ taste tests to tweak the final product. The response caught them off guard, Adam said.“We thought they’d buy a few hundred, but the first order came in and it was for 6,400 wraps. On top of making the retail packages at the same time – it was kind of overwhelming,” he said.Galindo said Fairbanks, Anchorage and several Washington school districts are penciling the salmon wraps into their lunch budgets. Providence Hospitals and Safeway added the larger retail sized wraps to their lineups in May, and more customers are calling.“Wal-Mart has picked up the wraps, Target has approved it, and we’re in negotiations with Sam’s Club and Fred Meyer,” Galindo said.The Taco Loco wraps use sockeye salmon purchased from Copper River Seafoods. Galindo said he expects to buy 40,000 pounds of sockeye meat this year, up from 10,000 pounds last year. He said Taco Loco plans to expand its line of wraps to include Alaska pollock.Dean Hamburg, who also is president of the Alaska School Nutrition Association, said schools too often have to default to the least expensive items, such as the Trout Treasures that are offered on menus in Juneau and other school districts.“Alaska seafood can be an affordable, more wholesome addition,” he said, “and it gets served up with a sense of pride among kids and staff at lunch time.”Ideas wanted for salmon wastesEach year, more than 150 million pounds of salmon parts are tossed out as waste by Alaska’s salmon industry. But there’s gold in all that gurry, and money is available for ideas to turn co-products into profits.“We can start with salmon heads because of the high concentrations of oils,” said Capt. Bob Pawlowski, director of the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. For 30 years, the nonprofit AFDF has partnered with industry stakeholders to fund long term advancements.“There are good gelatins, protein powders or flakes dried at low temperatures, meals and oils that include all the soluble proteins and flavors and aromas that are very appealing to the pet food industry, health supplements, leathers and clothing, bio-fuels — it can all be processed and handled,” Pawlowski added. “With spiraling costs all ‘round, we must find ways to use this biomass.”The AFDF will fund innovative projects ranging from $15,000 to $75,000.“We’re looking for ideas from our members and from people in the industry who deal with this on a daily basis, and small entrepreneurs. Put on your thinking caps and we’ll put out some money,” Pawlowski said.Funding for the program comes from the Southeast Sustainable Salmon Fund. Deadline to submit a proposal is July 18; projects will begin in October. Contact AFDF in Anchorage at 907-276-7315 for more information.MCA kudosThe Juneau-based Marine Conservation Alliance Foundation has received a national award for its marine debris clean up program. The program has partnered with local communities to remove thousands of tons of nets, plastics and other debris from Alaska coastlines.“The foundation’s work is a model for the nation,” said Jim Balsiger, director of NOAA Fisheries.The MCA will receive the Coastal Habitat Restoration Award in Washington,  D.C. as part of NOAA’s third-annual Sustainable Fisheries Leadership Awards Program.<COL>Take a hike ‘Trout Treasures’<COL>2008-06-04<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/05/waiting-for-coppers-to-come-in/<COL>Waiting for ‘Coppers’ to come inSalmon fishermen are already pulling the first spring kings from the Stikine River near Wrangell amidst little fanfare. All the headlines and hubbub await the “official” start of Alaska’s 2008 salmon season this week when reds and kings return to Copper River.“All the guys are running around in their boats getting everything squared away. It’s a very busy town this time of year,” said Glenn Hollowell, Copper River fishery manager at the hub office in Cordova. More than 500 fishermen hold permits for the famous fishery, and a large portion of the fleet will be out on the water for the May 15 opener.Early forecasts peg the Copper River king salmon catch at 45,000 fish — slightly higher than last year. That’s not the case for the sockeye harvest, projected at 750,000. That compares to nearly 2 million reds last year, the third largest harvest in 117 years.As always, weather will play a role in the arrival of the season’s heralded first fish.“That’s always a big question,” Hollowell said. “We’ve had a fairly warm winter with a lot of snow and I think we’ll have a fairly quick break up. For the past couple of years we’ve been having later returns and the fish come back all at once, so that’s what we’re planning for.”And as always, upscale restaurateurs and chefs are jockeying to be the first to offer Copper River salmon to their customers.“Copper River salmon sets the standard for the entire season,” said renowned Pacific Northwest Chef Charles Ramseyer, who now runs a restaurant called Wild Salmon in New York City.No word yet on what prices fishermen might fetch for their prized first catches, which usually start out as jaw droppers. Low catches during last year’s first opener pushed prices to a record $6.75 a pound for kings and $4.50 for sockeye salmon.From now on, Alaska salmon fisheries will open at various times from Ketchikan to Kotzebue, with many lasting into the fall.  State fishery managers project a 2008 Alaska salmon catch of 137 million fish, down from 212 million salmon last year.The dip stems from anticipated shortfalls in pink salmon runs at the prime producing regions — Southeast Alaska and Price William Sound. Statewide pink salmon catches are projected at 66 million fish, down by more than half from 2007 and the lowest pink catch since 1992. For the big money fish — Alaska sockeye — another huge harvest of 47 million fish is projected; nearly 30 million of the reds will come from Bristol Bay.Steam me upBig boilers, chillers and pumping systems are at the heart of large fish processing plants. Much of the steam they generate can be recaptured and reused as energy — instead of going up the smoke stack.“Large food processing plants generate hundreds of thousands of pounds of steam per hour,” said specialist Ed Stoermer of Industrial Energy Systems. “Typically, for industrial steam boilers, that means anywhere from 15-25 percent of the energy that is put into the boiler is lost up the stack. That energy can be recovered back into their plant.”“To make the steam, there is a fuel input of natural gas or oil or coal, but there is a lot of inefficiency with the combustion and the steam production cycle,” Stoermer explained. “The energy that is lost is exhausted into the atmosphere.”Whereas all kinds of new technologies are becoming available, improving the efficiency of the equipment on hand is the quickest and easiest way to begin saving energy (and money) now, he advised, especially in remote Alaska.“The most straightforward approach is to recapture some of the energy that is lost, whether that is heat of compression due to refrigeration systems, or recovering energy from the stacks, or some of the blow down from the boilers on the water side — those are going to be the simplest steps to reduce costs,” Stoermer said. “It also reduces an equivalent amount of emissions that are dumped into the atmosphere.”Industrial Energy Systems is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio and has an office in Portland, Ore.

The city was getting ready to shell out big bucks to engineering firms to solve the noise problem. Turns out, it was mating calls of black drum fish. It was proven by a graduate student who recorded the mating calls and showed how they travel at a low enough frequency to carry through sea walls, into the ground and into the homes.Another disturber of the peace is the loud grunts and hums of the midshipman fish as it guards its nest, and the tiny cusk eel can sound like a jackhammer. For years, the mating calls of cod have wreaked havoc for the Norwegian navy, because they sound so similar to enemy submarines. Poachers in China use hydrophones to locate the nearly extinct croaker, whose bladder sells for up to $60,000.But overall, not much attention has been paid to fish sounds. Researchers believe fewer than 1,000 sounds have been recorded out of an estimated 30,000 species. It appears, however, that more people are turning an ear to the sea.Scientists say the underwater soundscape can tell a lot about what’s out there — and what they are doing. NOAA Fisheries has reportedly made listening to marine life “a priority,” the NY Times said, adding: “Since many fish make identifiable sounds, it offers potential for fisheries research and management. Passive acoustics can help identify breeding grounds and can be used as a tool to assess stocks. Such noninvasive techniques would be a big step forward.”Find the article “What’s Making That Awful Racket? Surprisingly, It May Be Fish” atwww.nytimes.com.

The fish were escapees from west coast fish farms, and Alaskans feared the Atlantic transplants would take hold and taint the gene pool of wild stocks. But good news – just seven Atlantic salmon have been captured in Alaska waters since 2006.“We can only count the fish that are brought in, but the numbers have gone down significantly in the past 10 years,” said Tammy Davis, invasive species project leader for the state Sport Fish Division. “We have to commend the fish farmers in Washington and off the coast of British Columbia for their efforts to contain their stocks.”It’s northern pike that pose the biggest threat to salmon and trout in South Central lakes and streams, Davis said. Those voracious feeders were illegally transported from north of the Alaska Range to the Susitna River Drainage in the 1950s. Crayfish also have been released and captured in the Kenai River, said biologist Bob Piorkowski.“They’re like vacuum cleaners and eat everything on the bottom,” he said.Ditto tiny New Zealand mud snails, which often arrive in Alaska on the bottom of boots or other outdoor gear. The snails were called “a serious threat to Alaska’s sport fisheries” in a 2002 Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan.“If anyone is coming to Alaska, make sure your wading gear, especially with felt liners, have been in the freezer for five or six hours. It will kill the mud snails,” Piorkowski advised.Hundreds of invasive marine species make their way around the world as stowaways in the ballast water of ships. For Alaska, a watch is on now for European green crabs in Southeast and South central waters. The highly adaptable crabs are making their way up the west coast and have huge appetites for oysters and other crabs.“The furthest north population is off the coast of Vancouver Island, and researchers believe there is a very good chance that green crabs could move up the coast to Alaska,” Davis said.Fishery managers encourage anyone who spots an odd sea creature to bring it to an appropriate office.“You know what lives on your beach. If you find something unusual, we’d love to hear about it,” Davis said.If you suspect you’ve landed an Atlantic salmon, look for spots on the gill plates and a slender, pinched tail. Alaska’s identification number for Atlantic salmon on fish tickets is 666 – the Biblical sign of Satan.Begich beginsClimate change is the biggest challenge facing Alaska’s fisheries, believes Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich. The U.S. Senate candidate recently launched a series of teleconferences for reporters in remote regions. Begich said it is part of his ‘full access’ promise to keep all Alaskans more engaged in political decision-making.Begich ticked off challenges to the seafood industry: “High energy costs to go out and catch the fish…they need affordable health care…a sustainable financial lifestyle, capital for new vessels and equipment upgrades….”Begich is getting his sea legs by traveling to fishing communities, and said he is hearing “lots of differing philosophies” about Alaska fisheries management.“It’s mixed within the industry, but I do hear concerns that final decisions around fish allocations are not done out in the open, and decisions are not always based on science,” he said.The mayor is on more solid ground with energy issues, a centerpiece of the Begich campaign both in terms of new ideas and criticisms of “our current representation.”“Because of the lack and neglect over the past 40 years to focus on a long term plan, we have no energy policy for Alaska or the nation. Now people are paying enormous costs for energy, we are dependent on foreign fuel, and we have put ourselves at economic and national risk,” Begich said.“When I see wind farms in rural Alaska producing enough energy so they don’t have to buy 80,000 gallons of diesel – we should step up as a nation and put hard dollars on the table to offset the cost that the consumer has to pay,” Begich said. “If you front load the financing for these energy projects, it’s tough to get them working today.”Begich said he has not taken a position yet on the proposed Pebble Mine, situated at the headwaters of Bristol Bay.“I want to let the process between all the different agencies move forward because that has barely started. I’m one of these guys that believes you have to allow the scientific evidence to move forward before making any policy decision,” Begich said.“That said, I do have grave concerns,” he quickly added. “In this case, the fisheries in the long term, because that is a sustainable, renewable resource that we have to make sure under any circumstances – and I don’t care if it’s Pebble or any other development in our state – we make sure it is protected.”Go fly a kiteFishing by wind made history in Hawaii last week, when a 20-pound ono and a 160-pound tuna were hauled aboard kite-powered boats.“Seems like the incubator for this is going to be the fishing industries, you know?” said Ian Fisher, co- owner of a Maui-based start up company called Kite for Sail. Fisher has been developing simple kite systems for sport and fishing boats since 1999, tapping into the steady trade winds of the Hawaiian Islands.“The way the kite moves through the wind and the hull moves through the water is a natural combination,” Fisher said, “The pulling instead of pushing force makes it very versatile and really smoothes out the ride. Most boaters will find it very useful.”The kite system can be used off any size powerboat or hull, Fisher said. It includes an inflatable kite (5 to 20 meters), five lines, and a winch. When the kite latches on to the powerful winds far above the water, boats can really pull back on the throttle.“If you’re going to travel over a certain course and you have a good wind for an hour or so, the kite can be deployed to save anywhere from 20-30, even 70-80 percent of fuel costs, depending on your hull type and your course off to the wind,” Fisher said.He estimated the cost of a kite system for a 30 foot fishing boat at $3,000-$7,000.“I think fishermen would be the most naturally skilled kite pilots and really help grow the concept,” he said.Kite systems can also power energy solutions on shore, he added. “It can be used to pump water, make compressed air, produce electricity – things of that nature.”Check out www.kiteforsail.com  – also find a great video called ‘Kite Fishing Hawaii’ on YouTube.<COL>Atlantic salmon wanted<COL>2008-06-11<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/06/fish-feed-expands/<COL>Fish feed expandsBy Laine WelchBristol Bay fishermen will be expanding their salmon donations this summer to help feed elders, toddlers and school kids in Southwest Alaska.“The fish we get donated will go to 13 school sites, Head Start, as well as meals for senior citizens in nine outlying communities this year. I’m just tickled to death,” said Patty Luckhurst, director of school nutrition services at Dillingham.Luckhurst  made headlines last year when she single-handedly spearheaded a program to get locally caught salmon onto school lunch trays. She rallied local fishermen to donate the fish and Peter Pan Seafoods agreed to process it for free.“Last year fishermen donated 8,000 pounds of red salmon and within three days I had 4,000 pounds of beautiful red fillets all individually vacuum sealed in the school freezer,” Luckhurst said.“Our part is the easy part,” said Tom Whinihan, general manager at Peter Pan in Dillingham. “It’s Patty and the fishermen out there who deserve the thanks.”Similar to last year, after the peak of the sockeye run Peter Pan will again designate tenders throughout the region and take salmon from any fisherman who wants to donate to the program.Many smaller schools, like Dillingham, still make most meals from scratch and do their own baking. Luckhurst, a 20-year veteran of school kitchens, said high shipping costs to get fresh produce or proteins to remote regions can be prohibitive, adding that milk is now $8 a gallon.“That’s why it makes sense to purchase and prepare more foods locally. We saved at least $12,000 last year not buying fish nuggets or something else to have on the menu.   That really spoke to the bottom line,” Luckhurst said.“Even if the fish wasn’t donated, I believe the cost would be appropriate for us to buy it from here. And it behooves us to support our local fishermen all over the state. With all the reports about how healthy fish is and that we should all be eating more – with it right here there is no sense in bringing in processed stuff anymore,” Luckhurst added.“There is something wrong with a picture where you’re importing farmed trout or other things when wild salmon is such a big part of their culture,” echoed Whinihan. “It’s great for the kids and the elders and all ‘round.”“Plus, the kids love it,” he added. “It’s something they’re proud of because for a lot of them, it’s their dad out there catching that fish and they are real boastful of that. It’s a really neat thing.”Both agree that other coastal Alaska communities should partner with local processors to provide fish to local schools and elder feeding programs.“If I’m able to do this in Dillingham, why aren’t other schools trying to do it in their communities?” Luckhurst said. “Those fish plants and processors are all a part of the community and they are so open to helping the schools when they can.”“You bet,” said Peter Pan’s Whinihan. “The benefits far outweigh everything in the big picture.”Alaska’s leading lunch lady said she has more plans to enhance her area’s healthy menus.“I’m going to hit up local lodges for donations of caribou and moose.”Sun screen kills corals- All that sun block being slathered on by beach-goers around the globe is causing major damage to ocean corals.A study funded by the European Commission revealed that the mix of 20 compounds used to protect skin from the harmful rays of the sun causes rapid bleaching of coral reefs.  Researchers at the University of Pisa in Italy added controlled amounts of three brands of sunscreen to water surrounding coral reefs in Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand and Egypt. Even small doses caused huge discharges of the tiny algae that live within the coral colonies, providing nutrients and vibrant color. Complete bleaching occurred within 96 hours.According to the World Trade Organization, nearly 10 per cent of world tourism takes place in tropical areas, with almost 80 million people visiting coral reefs each year. The WTO estimates up to 6,000 tons of sun screen lotions are released into reef areas each year – and that close to 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs are at risk of sunscreen-induced bleaching.While Alaska’s deep sea corals face threats from ocean acidification, they are  safer from sun screens. The seas surrounding the Aleutian Islands are believed to harbor the highest abundance and diversity of coldwater corals in the world. Unlike tropical corals, these corals do not form reefs but, assemble into dense gardens that can live hundreds of years. Because of the region’s remoteness, Alaska’s corals are just recently   being explored.<COL>Fish feed expands<COL>2008-06-18<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/07/catching-a-tax-break/<COL>Catching a tax break?Alaska fishermen are hoping to catch tax breaks on two fronts: high fuel costs, and oil spill payouts (if any) from Exxon.“We’re seeing a 69 percent increase in fuel costs in Cordova from June of last year,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) in a phone interview after she traveled to several fishing communities. “In Dillingham, the increase is 54 percent. In Kodiak, it’s 58 percent over last year. Fishing families can’t sustain this.”Murkowski said she is deeply troubled by the number of fishermen who tell her that high fuel costs are forcing them out of business.“When you have 1,700 fishermen say we need your help in Washington to do something so we can be out working, we figured we had to find someway to provide relief,” Murkowski said, referring to a statewide petition signed by Alaska fishermen and delivered to her senate office.Senators Murkowski and Stevens are pushing a bill that would give fishermen an extra fuel tax deduction for the next two years. The deduction would be based on the difference between fuel prices paid on Labor Day 2004, adjusted for inflation, and prices paid this year. The deductions would apply to fishermen across the U.S.“It does mean that you’re going to have to put cash up front and absorb those costs at the fuel dock. But it gives some hope that when tax time comes around, you’ll be able offset some of what you have paid,” Murkowski said. “It’s one small effort, but we believe it will be a help to our nation’s fishing families.”Alaska fishermen will take any break they can get, especially in the face of lower than expected salmon catches in most regions.“Cordova is like a ghost town,” said Rochelle van den Broek, director of Cordova District Fishermen United. “It feels like the middle of winter as very few can afford to pay fuel costs to return home between openers, and are docking at Whittier or staying out in the Sound on their boats. The loss to local businesses is yet to be fully realized. It is an industry-crushing problem.”“We’re doing a good job of sustaining the fish, but we also need to sustain fishing businesses,” said Mark Vinsel, director of United Fishermen of Alaska. “To get any help in Congress, we need support from other states. All fishermen need to educate and enlist their delegations to get onboard with this.”Some in Congress will object to giving temporary fuel tax breaks to fishermen, since all industry sectors are suffering.  But Senator Murkowski said the fishing industry is unique.“Fishermen can’t pass on cost increases to customers, turn to alternative modes of transportation, or sell their product for a higher price,” she said.Can oiled fishermen catch a tax break?Also coming before Congress: The tax bill designed to give fishermen a break from paying taxes right off the top of Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) awards. The measure would provide one-time tax relief for the awards by allowing income averaging and increased retirement contributions.The EVOS Tax Treatment is likely to be included in the Tax Extenders bill that the House Ways and Means Committee will take up this week. The Oiled Fishermen group is lobbying hard for passage, and urges support by contacting lawmakers.The message is simple: “I support the provision in the Tax Extenders Bill that would give Exxon claimants tax relief.”Questions?

Its annual report to Congress last week revealed that seven stocks were removed from the over-fishing list in 2007, and none were added. No fisheries in Alaska waters were on the list.The agency admits there is still work to be done: of the 244 stocks reviewed, 203 (83 percent) were not subject to over-fishing, while 41 (17 percent) were. Federal managers aim to end all over-fishing by 2010, as required by the nation’s top fish law — the Magnuson Stevens Act.At least Oprah noticed. An article in the June “Oprah!” Magazine noted: “Alaska has the best managed fisheries in the world with healthy populations, in every sense of the word.”Other fishing highlights from NOAA Fisheries: U.S. fishermen landed 9.5 billion pounds of seafood in 2006, down slightly from 2005. The value increased slightly to $4 billion. Average dock prices increased by 27 percent for fish, while shellfish prices decreased by 7 percent. Bluefin tuna prices showed the biggest boost, up 83 percent; while snow crab prices dipped the most, by 35. Across the board, dockside prices to U.S. fishermen averaged 42 cents a pound in 2006, up one penny from 2005.<COL>Catching a tax break?<COL>2008-07-09<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/02/barents-sea-invaded/<COL>Barents Sea invadedLaine WelchIt’s an invasive species problem that Alaska would love to have. Millions of snow crabs are on the march in the Barents Sea and no one knows how they got there or what to do with them – yet.The Barents Sea, which straddles Norway and Russia, is the same source of all of that jumbo king crab (much of it caught illegally) that wreaked havoc on Alaska’s market for the past couple of years.But unlike king crabs, which were purposely introduced by Russia into those waters in 1966, the opilio (snow) crab is a true invasive species. Long-time market analyst Ken Talley reports that no one is sure how the snow crab reached the Barents Sea. The first sightings appeared in the Russian zone in 1996.“The most likely way, say scientists, is from ballast water in tankers that ply the waters,” Talley wrote in his bi-monthly Seafood Trends newsletters.According to Jan Sundet, a leading Norwegian scientist and crab expert, the snow crab stock is estimated at 10-12 million adults, similar to the abundance of the region’s king crab.No matter how they got there, the snow crabs are spreading fast.“They are now routinely caught by Russian and Norwegian king crab fishermen,” Talley said.The Norwegians have no interest in such a fishery at this time, Talley added. Rather, they are worried about the environmental impacts of this invasive species on their traditional fisheries. By law, fishermen are forbidden from returning any snow crab back to the Barents Sea to keep them from spreading.The Russians, on the other hand, appear more interested, Talley said. “Currently, there are no official discussions or negotiations between Russia and Norway about a snow crab fishery,” he added.Scientists are asking for government funding for research and stock assessments on the Barents Sea snow crab. When and if the situation clarifies, a commercial fishery will develop, Talley predicts.“Fishermen and marketers are watching the situation carefully,” he said. “The impact of a fishery with huge volumes snow crab could roil the crab market just as Barents Sea red king crab has done.”Alaska supplies only about 10 percent to the U.S. snow crab market, which purchases roughly 100 million pounds per year. The bulk of the catch comes from Russia and primarily, eastern Canada.Deadliest Catch? Think againIt comes as a surprise that the most lethal fishery is not crabbing in the Bering Sea.  Pacific Fishing magazine reports that Dungeness crabbers in the Pacific Northwest have the highest fatality rate of them all – 17 deaths in the past seven years. That’s 50 percent higher than Bering Sea crabbers, and four times the rate of all U.S. fisheries.Labels are misleadingMany popular foods claim they are “Made in America” – but the stuff that’s in them probably comes from elsewhere – notably China. Because of cheap labor and minimal environmental regulations, China now dominates the world market in vitamin supplements and other chemical food additives commonly used in American processed foods, such as stabilizers and emulsifiersBut U.S. food makers are not required to disclose the source of the ingredients in their products, and that leads to lots of labeling loopholes.“With raw materials, if a product is changed substantially, like breaded, it becomes a product of the U.S. no matter where the raw material comes from. So if you’re interested in what the raw material is, there is really no way to tell,” said Pat Shanahan, program director with the Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers marketing group. GAPP represents all Alaska shore based and at-sea pollock producers.To help ease the confusion for seafood buyers, GAPP uses its own prominent label to assure buyers of its origin.“Our competing products are Alaska pollock that is caught in Russian waters. It’s headed and gutted and frozen onboard the Russian boats, and shipped to China for further processing. But if that fish is given a crispy coating Stateside, the product you see on supermarket shelves will say ‘Product of USA’,” Shanahan explained.The same confusion applies to canned seafood. Companies can sell foreign or farmed canned salmon, for example, with the same labels as Alaska products. Because the new Country of Origin labeling laws don’t apply to canned seafoods, customers can’t tell if it is truly an Alaska product.Certainly, most major food companies are rigorous about the ingredients they use. But at a time when the U.S. is importing more foods than ever, federal budget constraints have reduced inspections to less than one percent of all U.S. food imports.<COL>Barents Sea invaded<COL>2008-02-13<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/02/coverage-sought-for-fishermen/<COL>Coverage sought for fishermenBy Laine WelchAffordable health care coverage for America’s fishing families could soon become a reality.Sen. Ted Stevens and Sen. Lisa Murkowski last week introduced the Commercial Fishing Industry Health Care Coverage Act to Congress. The bi-partisan bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts; Congressman Don Young is introducing the same bill in the U.S. House.The measure would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund $50 million in matching grants for fishing states or organizations. The money would help jump start costs for getting healthcare coverage plans up and running based on each state’s needs. The money also would be used to offset individual health care costs, and provide group insurance coverage for more fishing families.“There are more people involved in the fishing industry in Alaska than any other industry, and yet they do not have a comprehensive plan. Some businesses are big enough to have health insurance plans but the smaller ones, particularly the individual fishermen, don’t in most cases. This legislation addresses the problem by allowing them to band together to purchase group coverage,” Sen. Stevens said in an interview.Coverage would extend to boat owners, captains, and crew, as well as other individuals performing fishing industry related work, such as shore-side support employees and their families.The grants would provide up to $200,000 per year for up to two years for the states to plan and develop a health care coverage program. Programs would then be able to apply for start up grants for up to $2 million annually for two years.Programs that received administration grants for the full five years of eligibility could apply for up to $3 million annually for up to five years, “if the state they serve experiences insufficient fish stocks or depressed markets that jeopardize the ability of the program to continue providing affordable health care coverage” the bill says.Although everyone is clamoring for better health care coverage for all Americans, Sen. Stevens said that the proposed law for fishermen is likely to draw some fire.<COL>Coverage sought for fishermen<COL>2008-02-20<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/03/finding-fortune-in-fish-oil/<COL>Finding fortune in fish oilLaine WelchAlaska’s future fortunes could soon be fueled by another oil boom — and it won’t be from crude.Fish oils are the biggest buzz in the bio-products world, said Peter Bechtel, a U.S. Dept. of Agriculture researcher at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks.“We’re seeing almost a revolution right now. Everyone is interested in the health benefits from omega 3 fatty acids, and Alaska’s cold water marine fish are an excellent source,” he said.Several things are driving the bio-rally, especially in today’s climate of “planet consciousness.”“We have a huge amount of material in Alaska that isn’t made into fillets or roe, and we need to do something with this,” Bechtel said. “This is especially important to parts of the salmon industry in Southeast Alaska.”According to 2005 federal data, Alaska fishermen catch approximately 2.5 million metric tons of fish each year, yielding 1.3 million tons of waste.A portion of that becomes fishmeal or fertilizers. Bechtel said seafood companies are realizing there is lots more value in all that fish gurry.“Almost anything that can be made out of these byproducts has increased in value tremendously in the last couple of years,” Bechtel said.The material can be made into fish oils, fishmeals, supplements, gelatins from skins, ingredients for farm animals, even ingredients for the cosmetic industry. Bechtel said fish oils can also cut energy needs in rural Alaska.“In Alaska a lot of fish oil can be made. The question is how much is it worth,” he said. “The current price is the same as boiler fuel. It can be used to heat hot water and other things.”Bechtel said Alaska “is making tremendous strides in byproducts utilization — one fish part at a time.”Adding value to fishFederal dollars could help fuel fish oil projects for Alaska fishermen.“Those would be value added products, because you’re taking the fish and processing it into a new product. That absolutely would be eligible,” said Dean Stewart, director of Business Programs for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program in Palmer.Adding value can be as basic as heading and gutting, or chilling the fish.“The result is intended to allow agricultural producers to receive more benefit from the products they produce, instead of just selling it in the raw form,” Stewart said.More than $18 million is available for the program nationwide. Up to $100,000 is available for planning grants and up to $300,000 as working capital grants. Stewart said the money can be used for branding and marketing programs, and custom processing.“Fishermen can contract for the processing, as long as they own the product and they get their own fish back,” he said. “The cost of that processing is actually a working capital cost and can be a part of the reimbursement through the grant.”The value added grants apply to all active fishermen.“We keep hearing about pockets of fishermen and family processing activities, and we really think there are good opportunities for us to support these projects,” Stewart said.Stewart says the application process has been streamlined and simplified. Deadline to apply for the Value-Added Producer Grants is March 31st. Questions? Call 907-761-7722 or www.rurdev.usda.gov/ak/Cod farming floundersCod farmers are scaling back on their predictions to be the next big boom in aquaculture. A few years ago, industry watchers hailed cod as the next aquaculture gold rush and said world-farmed production could approach 500 million pounds within a decade. But now cod farming appears to be floundering.Seafood.com editor John Sackton reports that fish growers in Norway — the world’s cod farming leader — now say they will produce less than 10,000 tons of cod this year, not enough for a viable market.Farmers are saying attempts to grow the fish commercially have hit some big biological roadblocks. A major problem is that farmed cod reach sexual maturity much more quickly than wild fish — sometimes within a year. That means when they reach market size 18 months later, the cod flesh has turned mushy, with no sales value. Selective breeding and other methods could solve the problem, but that takes money. Sackton said even with record wild cod prices, costs for successful aquaculture are high, and the problems have discouraged investors.Tilapia tweaked to taste wildMaking farmed fish taste like the wild thing is the latest investment of HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries. One of the world’s biggest tilapia growers, HQ has created “sea-flavored” tilapia by using a secret mix of flavoring compounds and other high tech methods to “manipulate its farmed fish to taste like wild pollock.”The company wants to break the hold that Alaska pollock has in the fast food and fish stick markets by better imitating the taste of wild fish. The Seattle-based HQ Maritime Industries — which touts itself as the leader in “zero toxin aquaculture” — operates in China, the world’s largest tilapia producer. The United States imports the most tilapia, and sales are growing at more than 30 percent a year. Worldwide, tilapia sales will likely top $4 billion by 2010.Check out the line up of events at ComFish next month in Kodiak at www.comfishalaska.com.<COL>Finding fortune in fish oil<COL>2008-03-05<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/02/lets-talk-fish/<COL>Let’s talk fishLaine WelchIt takes guts to talk fish, but five candidates hoping to snag Alaska’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives will take on the challenge next month in Kodiak.Congressman Don Young, Gabrielle LeDoux (R-Kodiak), and Democrats Diane Benson, Ethan Berkowitz, and Jake Metcalfe have agreed to participate in the well-known fisheries face off. That’s the catch: the debate is limited to fisheries and the seafood industrySince 1990 the fisheries debates, which kick off the annual ComFish Alaska trade show, have attracted nearly 100 percent participation by candidates for Alaska governor and U.S. Senate. This year will be the first time that U.S. House candidates participate.The big hook is that the debate is broadcast live to more than 330 communities across Alaska via KMXT/Kodiak and APRN.“The fishing industry is Alaska’s number one private employer and produces more than half of our nation’s wild seafood. This debate allows the candidates to share their knowledge and ideas about this vital industry,” said Deb King, director of the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce, sponsor of ComFish.Congressman Don Young, who has warmed the House seat for 35 years, was the first to take the bait.“The commercial fishing industry is a vital part of Alaska’s economy. It is the lifeblood of many of our communities, and an important part of Alaska’s future,” he said via email.Gabrielle LeDoux, who said she’s hoping for a hometown advantage, agreed.“The fishing industry is one of the top money makers for Alaska. For our coastal communities, fishing is it in terms of their economies. The ComFish debate provides a unique opportunity to tell Alaskans how much we value this vital industry,” she said.“Commercial fishing is more than just a job for many Alaskans, it’s a defining lifestyle,” said Jake Metcalfe of Juneau. “Anyone who wants to represent fishermen should take advantage of any opportunity to meet with them, and to respond to their concerns.”“ComFish is Iowa and New Hampshire rolled into one,” said Anchorage-based Ethan Berkowitz. “I want to keep Alaska’s coastal communities strong and make sure our fisheries are sustainable. I appreciate that the people of Kodiak are never shy with their opinions.”The fisheries debate takes place at the Kodiak High School auditorium on March 20 from 7-9pm.

They plan to be in the room on Feb. 27 when the U.S. Supreme Court sits down to hearings that will decide if Exxon must pay $2.5 billion in punitive damages to 32,000 plaintiffs hurt by the 1989 oil spill.Alaska stakeholders this month launched a web based Whole Truth campaign (www.wholetruth.net) to counter Exxon’s claims that there are no lingering effects from the oil spill, nor is any more money due.“Most cases are tried both in the court, and in the court of public opinion. We hope to raise the awareness of everyone in America to be watching this case. Maybe it will make the Court nervous about favoring big business over doing what’s right,” said Steven Smith, spokesman for Prince William Soundkeeper and Cordova District Fishermen United.Smith believes implications of the Supreme Court decision go well beyond a settlement with Alaska fishermen, and pose a threat to the Clean Water Act.“If Exxon gets a ruling that they are not responsible and don’t have to pay punitive damages, it does not speak well for our waters all over the world. If there is no downside to being careless, then why spend the money to be careful?” Smith said.According to CDFU director Rochelle Van den Broek, Gov. Palin is slated to speak about the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. from 10-11a.m. on Feb. 26. That will be followed by a candlelight vigil on the National Mall starting at 6 p.m.“This is our last big shot to maybe influence the decision that will be made,” Van den Broek said.Co-op primerPooling production and purchasing power can yield some nice advantages for fishermen. Find out the pros and cons in “Developing Cooperatives for the Alaska Seafood Industry.” (www.alaskaseagrant.org)Food producers usually form co-ops when they are frustrated by markets or supply costs, said AK Sea Grant marine advisory agent and co-author Glenn Haight.“By coming together they can demand more of a presence in the market,” he said.Haight cites the Seafood Producers Cooperative in Sitka as a prime model. The 500–member SPC began in the 1940s and is one of the largest and most successful fishing coops in North America. Kodiak’s Olga/Moser Bay Seafood Producers Alliance is another good co-op example. Four years ago setnetters there created a slick system that flies their fresh salmon directly to high-end buyers in Chicago.Most recently, Kodiak trawlers tested the waters for a co-op in the rockfish fishery. The slower pace extended the fishery from three weeks to seven months, keeping more seafood workers on the job longer. By fishing cooperatively, the trawlers cut halibut bycatch rates by more than 70 percent.<COL>Let’s talk fish<COL>2008-02-27<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/02/lent-pushes-seafood-sales/<COL>Lent pushes seafood salesLaine WelchThis week will mark the start of Lent on Ash Wednesday, a time of fasting and soul searching for hundreds of millions of Christians around the world.Ash Wednesday is so called from the ritual of placing ashes from burned palm branches on the forehead as a sign of repentance. This custom has been universal since the year 1091. The ashes symbolize the religious statement “remember that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return.”The word Lent derives from the Old English lencten, meaning spring. Many believers will give up favorite foods during Lent, especially meat. Or they’ll devote time to volunteering or charity work. The 40-day Lenten season, which this year runs from Feb. 6 to March 23, dates back to the fourth century.  Lent allows time for the faithful to prepare spiritually for Easter Sunday when, according to Christian belief, Christ returned from the dead.In many countries, the day before Lent – called Mardi Gras or shrove Tuesday – has become a last fling before the start of the long fasting season. For centuries, it was customary to not eat meat during Lent, which is why some people call the festival carnival, Latin for ‘farewell to meat.’And what the peak holiday sales season from Thanksgiving to Christmas means to retailers, Lent means to the seafood industry. Food Services of America, for example, reports that Ash Wednesday is the busiest day of the year for frozen seafood sales, and the six weeks following is the top seafood selling season for the entire year.While nearly all seafood enjoys a surge of interest during Lent, the most traditional items served are the so-called “whitefish” species, such as cod, pollock, halibut and flounders.But no matter what the seafood favorite, the six-week Lenten season is good news for Alaska, which provides more than half of all the nation’s wild caught seafood to U.S. restaurants and grocery markets.‘Laws’ tells all“Laws for the Sea” is a weekly publication that is a ‘must-have’ for anyone watch-dogging fisheries issues that come before the Alaska legislature.Now in its 14th year, ‘Laws’ began out of a “sense of frustration” and “a need for more timely news than the monthly trade magazines could provide,” said Juneau-based writer and publisher Bob Tkacz.“Trying to cover timely news in the course of a four month legislative session was impossible, and so I was kind of relegated to just writing stories about things that were over and done with,” Tkacz said. “I realized that there are a lot of people in the seafood industry and elsewhere who are interested in fisheries legislation going through the capital building. So I went to a weekly schedule for ‘Laws for the Sea’ and it has proven to be productive and useful.”Bob Tkacz was for years the lead correspondent for the former “Alaska Fishermen’s Journal” and a longtime writer for the “Petersburg Pilot.” Another motivation for launching ‘Laws for the Sea’ he said was to help reporters in remote regions provide good long distance legislative coverage for their communities.“I always felt my core clientele is the Alaska fisherman out in the villages and the communities who can’t afford to hire a lobbyist, or make more than one or two trips to the capital to testify on a bill that’s really important to them,” he said.‘Laws for the Sea’ coverage also goes well beyond fish bills.“This year, for example, there is a bill to increase the minimum wage,” Tkacz said. “That’s not a fish issue per se, but seafood processors and thousands of workers around the state could be affected by that bill. It’s like the ocean itself – the political sea of Alaska is all intertwined. Seafood businesses and stakeholders don’t just deal with fish. So all the bills that regulate business also relate to the seafood industry. Alaska seafood people want to know what the legislature does in Juneau and ‘Laws for the Sea’ tells them what’s going on.”Get a sample of ‘Laws for the Sea’ by contacting Bob Tkacz at junobob@att.net.The clones are comingThe United States is about to become the first country in the world to approve food from cloned animals. The Food and Drug Administration issued a summary report last week claiming there is no evidence that meat and milk from cloned animals are any different from the real thing.Cloning lets farmers or ranchers make copies of animals that fatten more rapidly, or cows that are better milk producers. The technology also applies to fish.For over 10 years a company called Aqua Bounty has been bio-engineering Atlantic salmon that grow up to 600 times faster than normal, and are ready for market in 18 months instead of the usual three years. Aqua Bounty, which operates labs and hatcheries in the U.S. and Canada, hopes to be the first fish company to get its “frankenfish” on seafood counters.“We have only changed one gene so the salmon use their own growth hormone more efficiently,” said company director Elliot Entis. The fish also have increased tolerance to cold, are more disease resistant, and are neutered to prevent inbreeding with wild stocks, he added.Many consumer groups, such as the Center for Food Safety, believe the verdict is still out on the safety and ethics of cloning. And national surveys show 64 percent of Americans are turned off by foods from cloned animals. Still, the FDA says since food from cloned animals poses no significant health risks, they need not be labeled.The FDA will decide by next year whether to allow the commercialization of cloned foods.Grant giveawaysAmerican Seafoods Company is accepting applications for its latest round of community grants. This month an advisory group will award a total of $30,000 to community projects that focus on hunger, housing, safety, education, research, natural resources and cultural activities.

Longliners holding quota shares of the prized flatfish will haul in about 50 million pounds during the eight-month season — a drop of 2 million pounds from last year.Whether or not the start up prices will mimic last year’s blow outs of well over $5 a pound in major ports remains to be seen, but it’s a given they will be high.“Solid prices generally aren’t locked in until fishing deliveries are made. Prices will be good to start, but I would expect a rather steep backslide to the market by mid week,” said a major Kodiak processor.He added there is some reluctance by major buyers who “got stung fairly badly” on the high opening prices last year, when the halibut cost more than the market would absorb. There also is some inventory of frozen halibut in the nation’s freezers.“Buyers will scramble to get the fish they need and it will be expensive,” predicted market watcher Ken Talley of Seafood Trend newsletter.Halibut prices seldom dipped below $4/lb at major ports last year during the entire fishery, which ends in mid-November. In fact, $4 was the average halibut price paid last year to Alaska fishermen, up from $3.71 in 2006, according to Troie Zuniga who tracks the stats for NOAA Fisheries in Juneau.The first month of the halibut season is usually the second-lowest for landings, following November, Talley said. May, June and August were the top three months last year for halibut landings.Most of the fish crossed the docks in Homer, which got 20 percent of all halibut deliveries last year. Kodiak placed second at 17 percent, followed by Seward, Sitka, Dutch Harbor and Juneau. Most of America’s halibut by far comes from Alaska, with small amounts coming into the U.S. from British Columbia and China.Dock prices devalue salmon fisheryWhen people talk about the value of Alaska’s salmon fishery, they always base it on the “ex-vessel” value – meaning the prices paid to fishermen. But that “common discourse” chronically undervalues the salmon fishery,” said market analyst Chris McDowell of the Juneau-based McDowell Group.“That ex-vessel value only represents 40 percent of the total value of the salmon industry,” he said. “It’s the first wholesale price that presents the full picture.”First wholesale is defined as “the price when a processor sells a product outside of their affiliate network,” McDowell explained, and includes the full spectrum of economic activity that occurs in Alaska from the salmon industry.“Forty percent goes to the harvesters, some goes to processors’ profits and all the rest is spent on the goods and services that are required to get the catch from a live fish to a food product,” McDowell said.For example, the value of the 2007 salmon catch is pegged at $370 million, but the first wholesale value pushes it closer to $900 million.The State Department of Revenue has just published its Alaska Salmon Price Report (ASPR) for 2007, which outlines sales volumes and values for six major products: canned salmon, frozen and fresh headed and gutted, frozen and fresh fillets and salmon roe. The ASPR includes data from Alaska processors which handle more than 1million pounds of salmon each season.At a glance, McDowell said some interesting trends show “big bumps” in sales of fresh salmon (37 million pounds), of which 19.3 million was sockeye. There also is heightened interest in Alaska salmon roe – especially from Europe.The ASPR is at the Dept. of Revenue Web site:  http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/other/fish/salmonreports/index.aspx?60620Hand-carrying humpiesPink salmon medevacs are being planned this spring at British Columbia’s Broughton Archipelago. The goal is to get migrating baby pinks past swarms of sea lice from the region’s 20 fish farms, and release them safely to sea 40 miles away.Scientists for years have been warning that the explosions of sea lice from B.C. fish farms are wiping out wild stocks of pink salmon. The Broughton run produces one third of British Columbia’s wild pink population. Alexandra Morton, a marine biologist with the Raincoast Research Society, calls it a “fatal collision.”“These industrial-scale farms crowd salmon into a feedlot type environment,” she said. “So by spring, each farm can be releasing a billion larval lice per generation.”Just one or two sea lice can be lethal to pink salmon fingerlings (called fry) because they don’t yet have protective scales. According to mathematical ecologist Mark Lewis, the wild salmon wipeout is happening fast.“If the infestations continue, the average total time to a 99 percent population collapse is four generations, or eight years,” he said. “Because we are already two generations into the decline, this leaves two further generations, or four years until local extinction of the salmon.”Frustrated with a lack of action by the B.C. government and fish growers, Morton, along with ecotourism operators and First Nation tribes, is planning a rescue mission called the “Adopt a Small Fry” campaign. The activists will catch hundreds of thousands of young salmon in beach seines, transfer them in buckets to holding tanks on fishing boats, and ship them safely past the swarms of sea lice to the sea.

Federal managers will decide next month if salmon fisheries in Oregon and California should be shut down completely. Washington might dodge the bullet, but that remains to be seen. It would mark the first time ever that the traditional salmon season — which runs from April through mid-November — was canceled.The crisis stems from major declines in salmon returning to the Pacific coast to spawn in their home waters. Most scientists point to “broad scale ocean survival problems” as the primary cause for the coast-wide salmon collapse. Others blame faulty fresh water management and pollution.According to the Seafood.com news site, the shut down will jeopardize the livelihoods of nearly 1,000 commercial fishermen. The closures will also kill recreational salmon fishing for millions of anglers.While the West Coast pain is likely to prompt a gain in interest and prices for Alaska king salmon — and to a lesser degree — coho, it does raise a few red flags. Planet-conscious buyers believe they are doing the right thing by not purchasing Pacific salmon because it is endangered — and to them, that includes Alaska.“It’s amazing how many times we get asked – ‘aren’t your fish endangered?’ There’s a lot of confusion out there in the market place, particularly when they hear reports about all the fish in the oceans will be gone in a few years,” said Ray Riutta, executive director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI). “We have a real challenge explaining to people that there is no shortage of fish in Alaska.”Another unknown facing Alaska seafood is the impact of the worsening U.S. economy. After nearly two decades of low food inflation, prices for staples such as bread, milk, eggs and flour have surged in the past year at double-digit rates — the fastest since 1990.Several factors contribute to higher food prices, analysts say, but none more than record prices for oil, which last week topped $110 a barrel. Food accounts for about 13 percent of household spending compared with about 4 percent for gas.“It’s the biggest risk we face economically, and it might be the thing that does us in,” Rich Yamarone, director of Argus Research Corp. told the Boston Globe.As Americans tighten their belts, will it take a bite out of Alaska seafood sales?“I don’t think we will be priced out of the market but there are definitely concerns,” Riutta said. “Restaurants are feeling the pinch and a lot of Alaska seafood is consumed at the restaurant trade. It’s kind of hard to predict at this point.”ASMI has been very successful at increasing the value of Alaska seafood at home and around the world, but Riutta admits it is a very expensive protein — especially when compared to cheaper farmed fish.“We’ve certainly got our work cut out for us to try and hold on to the prices we’ve managed to achieve over the past few years,” he said.More than half of our nation’s seafood catch comes from Alaska. As the U.S. dollar tanks to its lowest value ever — less than 72 cents last weekend — Alaska seafood sales could get a boost from overseas where currencies are soaring.“We all need to realize that about half of our seafood goes into the export markets — especially Europe,” Riutta said. The value of the Euro recently topped $1.50 against the U.S. dollar in world trading markets.The Alaska seafood brand provides some powerful incentive to European buyers, who lead the world in “eco-purchases.”“Our sustainability message about Alaska’s well-managed fisheries will be front and center in our marketing campaigns,” Riutta said. “Alaska also scores high for food safety. Buyers breathe a sigh of relief knowing Alaska seafood is healthy and safe.”However, getting those messages across is likely to be much more difficult due to a trimmed budget. ASMI, which is the state’s lone seafood marketing arm, has requested a $250,000 increase to its budget. However, that was slashed last week by state lawmakers.“The governor’s request was to boost the ASMI budget to $750,000, but that’s been gutted by the House, led by Mike Kelley from Fairbanks,” said industry watchdog Bob Tkacz. “ASMI is currently getting $500,000 from the state in direct marketing assistance. That compares to the Alaska Travel Industry Association getting in the neighborhood of $5 million for marketing help.”The budget cut means ASMI will cut all TV advertising and scale back other Alaska seafood promotions both at home and abroad. Currently, the seafood industry contributes about $7 million each year to marketing outreach.Big dip in Alaska salmon catchState fishery managers are projecting a statewide salmon catch of just over 137 million fish for Alaska this year, down from 212 million in 2007. The drop stems from big pink salmon shortfalls in prime regions.Here’s a sketch of the forecasts for the five species caught in Alaska: The catch for Chinook salmon (kings) is pegged at 672,000, up 110,000 from last year; For coho (silvers) the projected catch of 4.4 million is up 21 percent. More than half of the cohos will be caught in Southeast Alaska. A potential statewide chum harvest of 18.7 million fish falls within the top 10 chum harvests since statehood.For sockeye salmon (reds), another huge harvest of 47.1 million fish is projected. Nearly 30 million of the reds will come from Bristol Bay.In contrast, Alaska’s two largest pink salmon producers —Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound — are expected to have only modest returns this summer. State managers project a catch of 66.4 million pinks, down by more than half from last’s year haul of 144 million humpies, and the lowest pink salmon catch since 1992.<COL>Salmon shut down on West Coast?<COL>2008-03-19<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/04/greenpeace-wages-war-against-fish-sticks/<COL>Greenpeace wages war against fish sticksby Laine WelchGreenpeace is launching an assault against U.S. seafood retailers — and Alaska pollock tops the list of fish the environmental group wants removed from the marketplace. Alaska pollock is the largest food fishery in the world, and is regarded as a model for sustainable management. Pollock is most popular in fish sandwiches, fish sticks and seafood-flavored surimi products such as “seafood salad.”The Greenpeace campaign, which mirrors one in Europe that met with some success, uses a “red list” to rank good and bad seafood choices based on sustainable management and other “earth friendly” criteria.“We were quite dismayed and surprised to be on the red list,” said Pat Shanahan, spokesperson for the Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers (GAPP), a trade group that represents every Alaska pollock fishing company.“It seems to contradict the scientifically-based endorsement of Alaska pollock by nearly every other environmental group in the world, including the international Marine Stewardship Council which has a very extensive certification program,” Shanahan said. “It also goes against the government’s recommendation that people eat more seafood for their health.”That’s not enough for Greenpeace.“We have several concerns about the pollock fishery, among them Chinook salmon bycatch and food web impacts,” said Greenpeace Oceans Specialist John Hocevar in a phone interview from Texas.“Pollock is the dominant prey species for much of the marine life in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. As the industry has removed so much of the pollock, there has been a dramatic reduction in the available food for endangered Steller sea lions, depleted northern fur seals and other marine mammals,” he said.Hocevar added that Greenpeace is also very concerned about the overall health of the pollock stocks. He said that the group “has always felt it was a mistake” for Alaska pollock to merit a “green” label by the MSC.Greenpeace does give Alaska fishery managers some credit.“The number of boats that have observers is more than most other places, and there is a real emphasis on collecting data on fish stocks, if not on the broader ecosystem. There is not a problem with illegal catch and enforcement is strong. So these things are certainly positive,” Hocevar said.However, Greenpeace believes Alaska fishery managers “cut it too close to the edge.”“I would argue that the reason there is still so much fish in the Bering Sea is not so much that it is a fundamentally different management approach, but because people haven’t been fishing the area as hard for as long as other places,” Hocevar said. “And I really worry that we’re heading for some of the same problems we’ve seen in other places. It’s no surprise you see boats from New England or Norway or elsewhere moving to the Bering Sea after they’ve wiped out fisheries close to home.”Greenpeace is demanding that 23 seafood species be removed from U.S. retail shelves, including farmed salmon and shrimp. The group has sent surveys to U.S. seafood retailers asking them to outline their seafood purchasing and sales practices. It will then rank them and publicize the retail chains that score the lowest.According to the National Fisheries Institute, if Greenpeace is successful, it will halt sales of nearly 47 percent of the seafood sold in the U.S. Greenpeace claims 250,000 members in the United States and 2.5 million members worldwide.Pesticide brew kills salmonFishery managers could decide next week to close West Coast salmon fisheries for the first time ever. The shut down stems from a major collapse in salmon stocks all along the Pacific coast.Most scientists blame “broad-scale ocean survival problems” as the main cause for the crisis. But the federal government may be grossly underestimating the hazard that pesticides pose to the fish.Chemicals are routinely sprayed on crops and livestock and wash off into waterways. Past studies have looked at the effects of single pesticides. However, half of the Northwest waters sampled by the U.S. Geological Survey contain six or more pesticides – and new research shows that they make a lethal mix.Zoologist Nathaniel Scholz at the NOAA lab in Seattle exposed juvenile salmon to a cocktail of four or more pesticides at a time. The tests showed that the chemicals interfere with brain transmissions in salmon and harms their ability to feed. Even at the lowest concentrations, the fish became extremely sick.The pesticide chlorpyrifos was especially lethal. It is widely used to control cockroaches and fleas in homes, to control ticks on livestock and as a pesticide spray on crops. Because there is a great deal of information about where pesticides are sprayed, it may be possible to estimate the impact on fish.Scholz said that given the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to help salmon stocks recover, it is crucial to consider the biggest threats posed by pesticides. The story, “Pesticide Brew Spells Trouble for Salmon,” is in Science NOW Daily News.Remote controlled fishScientists are training fish to return to nets when they hear a tone that signals feeding time. The aim is to release farmed fish into the ocean where they would grow to market size, then swim into underwater cages for capture on cue.The Associated Press reports that researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute received a $270,000 grant from the federal government for the project. It is one of several being funded as part of aquaculture expansion plans in the United States.It’s not the first time sound has been used to train fish. Scientists in Japan, for example, have used the method to keep newly released farmed fish in certain areas, where they could then be caught in traditional ways. But no one has ever tried to get fish to leave and return to an enclosure where they can be captured.The Woods Hole researchers began their project last summer by placing 6,500 black sea bass in a big tank. Over two weeks they sounded a tone for 20 seconds, three times a day prior to dropping food in an enclosed “feeding zone” within the tank.  Afterward, whenever the tone sounded, the fish gathered in the feeding zone and waited patiently to be fed. Researchers are now trying to figure out how long the fish remember to associate the tone with the food.In May, 5,000 sea bass will be put into a large “aqua dome” feeding station that will be anchored to the ocean floor in a nearby bay. After they’ve been trained the fish will be released. A few days later, the scientists will sound the tone and see how many fish return to the dome.The ultimate goal is to cut the costs of fish farming. If fish can be trained to return to net pens after feeding in the ocean, it could reduce the high costs of feed as well as the amounts of fish wastes released into concentrated areas.<COL>Greenpeace wages war against fish sticks<COL>2008-04-02<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/03/haibut-prices-dip-a-bit/<COL>Haibut prices dip – a bitLaine WelchHalibut prices took a dip from the record prices Alaska longliners enjoyed at the docks last year. Still, there’s no cause for complaint.Since the March 8 start of the halibut fishery, about 2.5 million pounds has crossed the Alaska docks. Unlike last year, when the first fresh fish of the year fetched $5.50 per pound or more at major ports, starting prices this year were down about a dollar.Halibut prices paid to fishermen are broken out in three weight classes: 10-20 pounds, 20-40s and “40-ups.” A canvas of major buyers showed that the first landings at Homer fetched $4.90/lb, then quickly dropped to $3.70, $4.05 and $4.40.  Kodiak prices ranged from $3.74 -$4.20 a pound. Southeast Alaska halibut prices rang in at $3.80, $4.00 and $4.30 per pound.Some of the downward press on prices stems from supplies of frozen fish still in the nation’s freezers. The economic recession also has many Americans tightening their belts and resisting high-priced seafood items. Still, halibut remains hugely popular among high-end restaurants and retailers.“Halibut has reached an elite level. Everyone is turned on to it now,” said a major Southeast buyer.The fact that nearly 70 percent of the halibut offloaded at Homer was small fish (10/20s) was causing some buzz among buyers, who prefer mid-sized fish, and biologists, who prefer a nice mix. Homer is the nation’s No. 1 port for halibut landings primarily from the Central Gulf, which produces nearly half of Alaska’s 50 million-pound harvest.“The fish are still abundant, but they are in a natural downturn as two strong year classes from the late 1990s leave the fishery,” said Bruce Leaman, director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission.The first fresh fish of the year was flying off counters at 10th and M Seafoods in Anchorage at $13.95 a pound for fillets. (Food writer TC Mitchell said that was trumped by troll-caught winter kings from Southeast Alaska. Those beauties were selling at $19.95 a pound for the whole fish.)Fish watchIt must be spring! The roe herring fishery at Sitka Sound was set to take off any minute. The fleet will compete for 14,723 tons of fish — the largest quota ever. Last year’s catch was valued at $5 million at the docks. Bering Sea crabbers were quickly approaching their 56.7 million pound snow crab limit, with about 10 million pounds to go.<COL>Haibut prices dip – a bit<COL>2008-03-26<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/07/run-low-late/<COL>Run low, lateBy Laine Welch“Lackluster” best describes Alaska’s salmon season so far, and catches are likely to come up short when it is all over.Fishery managers projected a 132 million salmon harvest for 2007, but catches in late July totaled just 66 million fish past the midpoint of the season.“I would say that we will be fortunate to make the forecast, but pinks could make up for a lot quickly,” said Geron Bruce, deputy director of the state commercial fisheries division. “We’re at a really critical point right now, transitioning from sockeye and early chum runs to pink salmon, and some later sockeye fisheries and then cohos.”Managers predicted a significant decrease in the 2008 salmon catches, primarily due to projected reductions in pink salmon. But despite some bright spots at Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound and the South Peninsula, most Alaska salmon runs have been late and alarmingly low, yielding reduced catches.At Copper River, for example, the cumulative harvest for all 14 openers this season is 309,284 sockeye (red) and 11,255 Chinook (king) salmon. That compares to a total forecast of 742,166 sockeye and 46,908 kings for a fishery that is winding down fast.Sockeye salmon is the big money fish, comprising two-thirds of the value of Alaska’s total salmon catch.  The statewide sockeye catch so far is 36 million; the preseason forecast called for 47 million fish.“I don’t think our sockeye catches are going to come up to what we expected.  But it will still be pretty good,” Bruce said.“It sucks. It’s really terrible,” is how Tuck Bonney, assistant manager at Alaska Pacific Seafoods, summed up the Kodiak salmon fishery. Sockeye escapements have been marginal at major Kodiak systems this summer, and the combined catches for all species are below two million fish.The story was a bit different at Bristol Bay, home to the world’s largest sockeye salmon runs. Fishermen were poised to catch 31 million reds there this summer, but when the run arrived late and all at once, processing capacity was overwhelmed. When the catch reached 2.6 million fish in a single day, fishermen were put on strict trip limits or told to stop fishing altogether.“The governor’s office got an earful from Bristol Bay fishermen who estimated three million harvestable fish swam by their idled nets,” said fisheries advisor Cora Crome.The state ‘actively put out feelers’ for more processors, Crome said, but got no takers.“We just didn’t get any companies that really had a strong interest in being a new presence, and we definitely didn’t get any applications from floating processors,” Crome said, adding that it is apparent that Bristol Bay can use an assist.“We have a consistent pattern in the Bay right at the peak of the run where it’s clear that there is a need out there for a little bit more processing,” Crome said.Meanwhile, Alaska’s summer chum fisheries have just passed the mid-point with good catches (mostly hatchery fish) in prime producing regions of Southeast and Prince William Sound. The statewide chum harvest so far is 11 million out of a 19 million fish forecast.It’s too early yet to predict any trends for coho salmon, but Bruce called early catches ‘reasonable’ at 1.5 million. The projected Alaska catch is 4.4 million cohos.Which brings us back to those all important, tough to predict pinks.While early hatchery runs appear strong at Price William Sound, the wild pink returns appear weak there and at other prime producing regions of Kodiak and especially Southeast Alaska.‘Southeast is the largest producer of wild pinks salmon and it has not produced much of anything so far,” said Bruce. “August will tell the tale.”The statewide pink salmon catch so far has topped 18 million fish. The projected harvest of  66 million pinks is down by more than half from last year, and the lowest catch since 1992.Theories abound as to why so many of Alaska’s salmon returns have been weak this year, but many blame it on the cooler water and weather.“That transition from fresh water to the marine environment is a really critical time period for juvenile salmon, and we haven’t had very good springs in Alaska for several years. I believe that the early marine stage has had high mortality,” Bruce said.The cold weather, scratchy catches and sky rocketing fuel prices resulted in fewer salmon fishermen out on the water this year. Just 60 seiners are participating at Kodiak, for example, compared to 141 last year. The fleet at Copper River had dwindled to between 80-100 boats, down from nearly 500 earlier this season. People have had some pretty good paychecks in July,” Bruce said, “but if things die off in August, it’s going to really take their bottom line down quite a bit.”A lack of buyers for salmon in the Yukon and Kuskokwim regions will add to the economic struggle in those remote Alaska regions.The state will release the preliminary harvest and value estimates for the 2008 fishery in September.Get LOST – Alaska and the U.S. cannot lay any claim to the Arctic unless it signs on to the Law of the Sea Treaty.“We have an opportunity as an Arctic nation to extend our territory based on the outer continental shelf and annex an area close to the size of California. That would be available to us for resource exploration and development,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, who is urging Congress to ratify the treaty this year.Russia has already planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole and is building the first offshore oil rig that can withstand extreme cold and pack ice. Norway is staking claims to vast oil and gas deposits, and Canada has announced plans for an Arctic military training base. But the U.S. is not even at the table as Arctic borders are being drawn.“Not only can we not submit a claim or application, we cannot dispute anybody else’s if we are not a signatory to that treaty,” Murkowski said in a phone interview.The Law of the Sea Treaty originated in 1982 by the United Nations as a way to govern activities on, over, and beneath the oceans. But some provisions were strongly opposed by then President Reagan, and the U.S. has never signed on.Last week the US Geological Survey estimated the Arctic holds up to 25 percent of the world’s remaining oil and gas reserves. Murkowski said that means it’s time for the U.S. to get serious about signing the treaty.“We need to look at the Treaty  in view of what is going on in energy issues and our quest to be more energy independent. To me, it’s a no brainer,” she said.This year the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Russia adopted a declaration of cooperation in the Arctic, which supports the Law of the Sea Treaty as the legal framework for governance.  If Congress does not ratify it this session, Murkowski said, it’s back to the drawing board next year.“Meanwhile, we’re basically aced out.  All these other Arctic nations are able to tap into resources that we also should be able to claim for our own.But we can’t act unless we are a signatory to that treaty.The LOST has the strong backing of President Bush. Murkowski said the Treaty also is supported by Senator Obama, who serves with her on the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator McCain has not taken a position on the Law of the Sea Treaty, Murkowski said.<COL>Run low, late<COL>2008-07-30<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/07/fish-factor-2/<COL>Fish FactorAlaska leads nation in seafoodLaine WelchDutch Harbor/Unalaska easily remained the nation’s top fishing port, for the 19th year in a row. Nearly 780 million pounds of seafood, powered by Alaska pollock, were offloaded at the Dutch Harbor docks in 2007.The rankings were revealed last week by NOAA Fisheries as part of its popular annual report on U.S. Fisheries. Reedville,  Va., followed Dutch  Harbor as the No. 2 port for seafood landings; Empire-Venice, La., ranked third. The major product landed in both of those ports is menhaden, used for fish oils and feeds. Kodiak held on to the No. 4 spot for landings at 320 million pounds.For the eighth-consecutive year, pricey scallops pushed New  Bedford, Mass. to the top spot for catch value at $268 million. Dutch Harbor ranked second for seafood values at $174.1 million, up $8.9 million. Kodiak held on to No. 3 with landings valued at $126 million, an increase of $25 million from 2006.Other Alaska fishing ports making the nation’s 2007 top ten list for seafood values: No. 7 Naknek-King Salmon at $61.8 million, an increase of $10.5 million;  No. 8 Seward at $57 million, up $6 million;  No. 10 Sitka at $50.8 million.Alaska leads the nation in seafood landings at 5.3 billion pounds, more than double the catches of all the other states combined. Alaska also leads for seafood values at $1.5 billion annually.Seafood dip Americans ate slightly less seafood last year, reversing a three-year trend. According to NOAA Fisheries, which has been tracking per capita consumption since 1910, each American ate 16.3 pounds of seafood, down from 16.5 pounds in 2006. (The highest level was 16.6 pounds per capita in 2004.)But the decrease might not be due to waning interest in or recession-related belt tightening. Market expert John Sackton of Seafood.com points to a downward supply of America ’s favorite seafood: shrimp.“The drop in shrimp consumption mirrors the decline in shrimp imports, which provide 90 percent of the U.S. supply,” Sackton said. “Import restrictions on shrimp from China reduced shipments to the U.S. by nearly 30 percent.”Shrimp imports to the U.S. were down overall by nearly 6 percent last year, to 1.2 billion pounds. It was the first time shrimp imports have fallen on a year-to-year basis since 1996, Sackton said.More fish facts – Also from the 2007  report on U.S. fisheries:U.S. seafood landings totaled 9.2 billion pounds, down 3 percent, valued at $4.1 billion at the docks.Alaska pollock was the nation’s No. 1 catch.Americans spent $65 billion for seafood products last year.Fish accounted for 89 percent of total U.S. wild capture landings, but only 51 percent of the value.The U.S. imports nearly 84 percent of its seafood, up from 63 percent a decade ago.U.S. aquaculture, mostly catfish, meets 5 to 7 percent of the nation’s seafood demand.U.S. farmed oysters, clams, mussels and salmon supply 1.5 percent of American seafood demand.The average price paid to U.S. fishermen in 2007 was 44 cents, compared to 42 cents in 2006.The 2007 US Fisheries Report includes recreational fisheries.

The measure aims to give fishermen access to USDA loans, similar to other food producers, including US fish farmers. It was pulled from the US Farm Bill earlier this year.“When it comes to qualifying for these loan programs, there should be no difference between the corn farmer in Iowa and the fisherman in Kodiak,” said Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK), sponsor of the provision.The provision would extend the Farm Service Agency’s Operating Loan program to commercial fishermen in Alaska.  Fishermen will be able to access loans for basic operating costs, including boats, nets, and fuel.The legislation now heads to the full Senate for passage.Survey says ! Alaska Sea Grant wants input on how to focus its marine research, education and community extension efforts for the next five years.

It was a decline in imports of the No. 1 favorite – shrimp – that accounted for the overall dip in seafood consumption, market watchers said.Canned tuna held onto the No. 2 spot, although that product has been on a steady decline in recent years.   Salmon remained as the third most popular favorite, and saw the strongest gain of all seafoods on the top 10 list. Each American ate 2.2 pounds of salmon last year.Pollock ranked No. 4 again, and farmed tilapia remained at No. 5. Rounding out the top 10 list of favorites were catfish, crab, cod, clams and flatfish, which includes halibut.How does seafood stack up against the competing ‘center of the plate’ proteins of cow, pork and poultry?Americans continued their love affair with beef, said market watcher Ken Talley, with each person eating a whopping 62.4 pounds last year, a slight decline. Chicken ranked second at 59.8 pounds per person, although U.S. consumption dipped slightly.  Pork saw a hefty boost to 47.7 pounds, a 2.3 percent gain as farmers pushed pigs to market early to reduce production costs, Talley said. The biggest winner among major proteins last year was inexpensive turkey at 13.6 pounds per capita, a 3 percent growth.Discharge and Exxon Tax updates – Fishing boats got a break from tough new water discharge laws that would require permits even for hosing off the deck. Congress last week passed   legislation pushed by Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens that gives commercial fishing boats a two-year moratorium from permits for discharges under the Clean Water Act.  Senator Murkowski held up the original bill last week because it exempted all recreational boats from the permits– even 400 foot yachts – but not small fishing vessels. The measure will give relief to nearly 10,000 Alaska fishing boats, most of which are less than 36 feet.The Environmental Protection Agency is also tasked with determining the types and effects of discharges from fishing boats of varying sizes within 15 months. That information will be used to determine if the exemptions should be permanent.On another front: the bill to give a one time tax break to Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) plaintiffs is still on the move. It has been included in a tax extender, Senator Murkowski said.“The chairman of the finance committee has indicated to me that it is his full intention to include the EVOS measure in the tax extender bill, and that he recognizes   it is just good policy,” Sen. Murkowski said in a phone conversation.Coastie kudos-  Aug. 4 marked the 218th birthday of our nation’s oldest sea going service – the U.S. Coast Guard.It was originally launched in 1790 as the U.S. Lighthouse Service when the first Congress gave orders to build 10 vessels to enforce tariff and trade laws under the newly formed Treasury Department. At the time, that was the only source of revenue for the federal government. It then became known as the Revenue Cutter Service until 1915 when it was merged with the Life-Saving Service, and received its present name from Congress.In the Coast Guard’s Top 10 list of most memorable missions, the response to Hurricane Katrina three years ago ranks as No. 1. The USCG is credited with saving more than 33,000 people after it took charge there.The single largest rescue effort in Coast Guard history was in 1937, when a flood on the Mississippi River led to the rescue of 44,000 people — and more than 100,000 head of livestock.Two Alaska events made the Top 10 list: In 1897, six Coast Guardsmen set off from a Cutter near Point Barrow to save the crews of eight whaling ships trapped in the ice. Using dog sleds, they brought 400 reindeer to the whalers in a 1,500 mile journey that took more than two months. Also, the rescue of 520 people after a fire broke out and sank the cruise ship Prinsendam 130 miles off Ketchikan in 1980.Today, nearly 40,000 men and women serve in the US Coast Guard. They are credited for saving more than one million lives and counting.<COL>Fish take center plate<COL>2008-08-06<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/08/seismic-impact-on-fish-needs-study/<COL>Seismic impact on fish needs studyBy Laine WelchAs Alaska gets primed for more oil and gas development on land and at sea, seafood industry stakeholders are warily eyeing exploration plans amidst the world’s most abundant fishing grounds.The U.S. government has scheduled sales in 2011 of offshore oil and gas leases in Alaska’s North Aleutian Basin, a 5.6-million-acre “fish basket” that encompasses most of the southeastern Bering Sea and Bristol Bay.Ask any Alaskan what they fear most about oil exploration and they will say ‘oil spills.’ But you’ll get a different response from Norwegian fishermen.“We are not so frightened of the oil coming up, from a blow out. We are more frightened of the seismic. It is something that is out of sight, out of mind,” said Nils Myklebust, a 40 year fisherman and spokesman for the Norwegian Fishermen’s Association.Long before the first drop of oil or gas is extracted from the ocean floor, seismic tests are used to gather information about where the fuels might be located. The tests use an array of air guns deployed from special vessels to send explosive shock waves into the sea bed, which can reverberate for thousands of miles. The shots are fired every 10 to 25 seconds, around the clock, for the lifetime of the drilling project.Mykelbust says oil companies and the Norwegian government have done little research on long term seismic impacts on fisheries, especially on small fish.“They don’t know anything about how seismic is hurting the babies,” Mykelbust said in a phone interview from Norway. “Fishermen are very frightened because we see how the fishery has left a big area and we don’t know what that means for the future. In the North Sea, the fish are down 39 percent from the oil coming to this day.”Norway’s fishing and oil industries have co-existed since the late 1960s, but the feverish quest for new oil sources has sparked territorial clashes. Last year saw a record area covered by seismic surveys on behalf of 21 global petroleum companies, according to the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs.The fishermen argue that the increased activity is driving fish away from traditional grounds. Catches of Atlantic pollock in some regions, for example, dropped from 800 tons in 2006 and 2007 to just 83 tons last year.Mykelbust said Norwegian fishermen are not ‘anti-oil,’ but he urges Alaska to broaden discussions to include seismic testing and other impacts on the marine environment as the state moves toward offshore exploration.At Energy and Fisheries workshops convened by Alaska Sea Grant earlier this year in Anchorage and Kodiak, Gregg Nady of Shell Oil said “three dimensional” seismic testing was the preferred method in its “development scenarios” for the North Aleutian Basin area.Offshore energy quests come with other cautions that, like seismic testing, are often overlooked by an unknowing public.“The interactions include other operational noise and pollutants, drilling muds and cuttings that come from the platforms,” said Bubba Cook of the World Wildlife Fund in Anchorage. “What falls by the wayside is all the associated infrastructure that has to support oil and gas development. All of that needs to be part of the discussion.”Risky BusinessCommercial fishing is still America’s most dangerous occupation, according to the U.S. Department of Labor’s annual report, released last week.  In 2007, fishermen had the highest on-the-job death rate at nearly 112 per 100,000 workers – 36 times greater than the rate for all other occupations. One-third (327) of all work-related deaths that took place in Alaska during 1990-2007 were fishermen.Commercial fishing in the U.S. employs between 80,000-160,000 fishermen on 80,000 vessels, the report said. A further breakdown by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health shows that one-third of all fishing fatalities come from falling overboard; eight percent are from deck injuries. Fishing-related deaths represented less than one percent of last year’s 5,488 total occupational fatalities, down six percent from the previous year.Other dangerous jobs were loggers at 85 on-the-job deaths and pilots at 67 fatalities. More pilots meet their Maker in Alaska than anywhere else in the nation, with a one in eight chance of dying during a 30-year career. Most fatal crashes in Alaska come from losing visibility and flying into mountains.The third most dangerous occupation was iron and steel workers at 45.5 deaths on the job. The 2007 occupational fatality rate of 3.7 per 100,000 workers was the lowest since the U.S. Labor department began collecting statistics in 1992.Fish watchFor the first time in 15 years, Gunnar Knapp will be back in the classroom showing students how economics drives Alaska’s seafood industry.

It is packaged in the state’s new energy plan and is available through the existing commercial fisheries loan program.“The bill was signed by the lieutenant governor’s office last week and it is effective Sept. 27,” said Geoff Whistler, a lending officer with the state Commerce Department’s Division of Investments. “That is the date we can actually start approving the applications, but people can file the loan applications anytime. It is permanently in the regulations and will be an ongoing program for fuel efficiency in commercial fishing vessels.”Whistler said the loan can be applied to anything that will improve fuel efficiency, including overhauling an engine, replacing an engine or cleaning and maintenance. It is open to all commercial fishermen, with a few caveats.“Twenty-five percent or more of their income in the last two years must come from commercial fishing, they must be an Alaska resident for at least the last two years, and have no past due child support or IRS taxes,” Whistler explained.Whistler said Southeast trollers who have overhauled their engines report huge fuel cost reductions.”One family bought a Tier 2 John Deere diesel engine two and a half years ago and told us they went from using 12 gallons an hour down to 5 gallons an hour while trolling. In that time period they said they have paid for the cost of the purchase and installation of that engine in fuel savings,” he said.Halibut fisherman Jeneanne Holzman of the F/V Casino agreed.“We had our engine rebuilt a few years ago and we didn’t appreciate then what a difference it would make. But it has kept our fuel costs in a reasonable frame,” she told KCAW in Sitka.The energy loan interest rate is now at three percent, but Geoff Whistler said it will be variable until the loan is locked in.”So the sooner people apply, the better chance they’ll have of getting the lower rate,” he said.Another plus,  annual loan payments are not due until after the fishing season.Get more information at http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/investments/comfish.cfml or call Geoff Whistler in Juneau toll free at (800) 478-5626.Fish watch: Alaska’s salmon catch last week topped the preseason projection of 137 million fish. By Friday the statewide catch for all species totaled 137,476 salmon.The breakdown shows Chinook catches at 305,000; the sockeye harvest reached 38 million fish out of a projected catch of 47 million. For coho salmon, the statewide catch was at 3 million and is likely to reach the forecast of 4.4 million silvers; likewise, the chum salmon catch was nearing 16.5 million and should come in at the expected 18.7 million fish. The industry was breathing a sigh of relief as catches of hard to predict pinks reached 80 million, topping the forecast of a paltry 66 million pink salmon for this season.Copper River ouch – Alaska salmon catches were lackluster in many regions, and nowhere was it more evident than at Copper River. The cumulative harvest by last week for all 25 periods fished this season was 311,879 sockeye and 11,263 Chinook salmon. That compares to a 10 year average harvest of 1.3 million sockeye, and 43,059 Chinook   salmon. State managers said since 1969 only three seasons (1978, 1979, and 1980) have yielded lower red salmon catches, and only one season (1980) where Chinook salmon catches were lower.Fish heads and healthy hearts – Health professionals for years have touted the benefits of Omega 3 fatty acids in reducing heart attacks. And omega 3?s from cold water fish, especially wild salmon, pack the most punch. New research claims the benefits might be even better then you think.Results of two major studies that followed nearly 6,000 heart patients over four years were released last week by the European Society of Cardiologists. It concluded that fish oils rich in Omega 3?s work slightly better than Crestor, a popular cholesterol-reducing drug, to help patients with chronic heart failure. The doctors said people “should get the same benefits from taking cheaper, low-tech options like fish oil supplements – or by simply eating more oily fish like salmon.”Doctors around the world now believe that because cell membranes in the heart (and brain) are made of fatty acids, fish oils can help replace and strengthen those membranes with Omega 3s. Fish oils also are thought to increase the body’s good cholesterol levels, and stabilize the heart’s electrical system to prevent abnormal heart rhythms. The study findings were published online in the medical journal The Lancet.Salmon heads are the focus in Japan for another valuable health ingredient: chondroitin sulfate, used to relieve degenerative arthritis in knees, fingers, hips and other body joints. Seafood.com reported that Marutatsu Kamasui Company has developed a system for mass production of chondroitin from chum salmon heads, which are minced and processed into a concentrated liquid, then refined into a powder.The company aims to produce 10 tons of chondroitin from chum heads in its first year. The ingredient is said to have market demand of 200 tons a year just in Japan, and it is growing fast. Marutatsu Kamasui is the same company that has produced DNA materials from salmon sperm, used in the first organic LED lighting.AK pollock funds research- The Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center (PCCRC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (www.sfos.uaf.edu/pcc/) has issued its annual call for funding requests for marine research projects in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.

The money is collected as a deduction off the fish tickets during a fishery and goes to the Dept. of Revenue. It is then appropriated back to the RSDA’s prior to the next fishing season. Fishermen can use the money for any projects they choose.Salmon fishermen in two regions have embraced the concept so far – Bristol Bay and Copper River/Prince William Sound.  Southeast and Aleutian Islands harvesters have organized an RSDA and are set to vote on a tax assessment over the winter.Not surprisingly, Copper River/PWS fishermen were the first to form an RSDA as soon as the program was approved. A one percent tax paid by each of the region’s 540-member drift gillnet fleet yields up to $350,000 each year. The group has used the money to expand markets beyond the region’s summer fisheries, including west and east coast advertising promotions of fall coho salmon.The RSDA hosted a media tour of the Copper River fishery and Cordova community this summer, said executive director Beth Poole. The group also has developed a ‘best practices’ quality and handling guide, and aims to get an ice barge to service more fishing regions.“For a few years we’ve been working on getting an ice facility in Prince William Sound for some of the lesser known runs,” Poole said.The region’s 33 set netters will vote this winter on a self-tax and joining the RSDA, she added.  (www.copperrivermarketing.org)Bristol Bay fishermen comprise the biggest RSDA with its 1,800 member drift gillnet fleet. The group has amassed nearly $2 million from its one-percent tax on 2006 and 2007 catches, and projects to add an additional $1.4 million from the 2008 salmon season.“The primary goal is to improve revenues for Bay fishermen,” said RSDA director Bob Waldrop. “The fastest way to get to do that is through improved quality. We won’t spend one penny on marketing efforts until we do that.”To boost quality, the RSDA put more than half of its cash into chilling projects throughout Bristol Bay. Waldrop said two million pounds of ice was put into boat holds this summer, enough to chill up to 8 million pounds of fish so far.“Multiply that by 10 cents per pound as a chilling bonus and you’ve got a significant amount of money in the checkbooks of the fishermen, which normally wouldn’t have been there,” Waldrop said.Waldrop said it is gratifying to see fishermen working together in such a well organized way. The Bristol Bay group is hoping that the region’s set netters will also vote to join the RSDA, which would push its membership to 3,000 salmon permit holders.“The biggest challenge is selecting amongst all the opportunities available to us. There’s just so much to do and so many different ways to apply ourselves,” Waldrop said. “It’s not to say there aren’t some disagreements about ideas, but there is a great deal of unanimity about the sense of self empowerment that this represents – that we can make a difference. And we are.”(www.bbrsda.com)Fishermen in Southeast Alaska are trying again to launch a RSDA after narrowly voting down a self-tax in 2006. The initial effort was designed to include more than 60 fisheries; this time the attempt is being made on a smaller scale by the 486 member salmon driftnet fleet.“I’ve come full circle because there are so many more things you can do with an RSDA than we truly understood with the first vote,” said Chris Knight of Juneau, an interim board member who voted against the first RSDA.Knight said a primary focus for many Southeast communities is infrastructure developments.“In Juneau, for example, fisheries-related infrastructure is almost nil. We’ve got a couple of knuckle cranes on a dock, and that’s about it. There’s no loading facilities, no cold storage, there’s zero facilities for any fishermen  to really do anything on their own,” Knight said. “It’s important that everyone works in conjunction with our two local processors, but guys need to have some independence so they can market their own stuff or increase the value of their other fisheries. Tons of guys would like to ship fish out of Ketchikan or different places and they don’t have the facilities to do that. Things like that could come out of this RSDA.”Knight said a survey indicated that gillnetters would be likely to vote for a one-half percent tax to fund an RSDA, likely called Rainforest Wild. The interim board has scheduled meetings over the next two months to educate fishermen and ready them for a vote.“I am optimistic that we could actually build some infrastructure that would provide some real benefits for fishermen,” he said. We don’t have the option now.”Aleutian Islands fishermen are also planning to vote this winter on forming a RSDA, and funding it with a half percent self tax. (www.rainforestwild.org)About 50 fishermen from Sand Point, King Cove, Cold Bay, Nelson Lagoon, False Pass and Akutan created an “Aleutia” brand five years ago. They adhere to strict quality and handling procedures, and have successfully developed niche markets for Aleutia sockeye and king salmon.“All the fish are live bled on the boat and put on slush ice. The fishermen are very proud of the product they are producing,” said Aleutia operations manager Tiffany Jackson.Marketing will be Aleutia’s main focus, along with overcoming transportation hurdles.”The Aleutia brand is well known on the East coast and it’s in high demand. But the problem right now is how much it costs to get the fish from Alaska to New York,” Jackson said.Getting the fish to Anchorage is the most costly leg of the journey.“It costs us 80 cents to $1.00 a pound to get it to Anchorage, depending on which airline can get it out of Sand Point. If we’re sending frozen product to Seattle, that’s a different story – we can barge it,” Jackson said.   (www.aleutia.org)Energy tips and loans – Fishermen are being asked to share their stories and energy saving tips in a survey by Alaska Sea Grant and United Fishermen of Alaska.

Commercial fishing was Alaska’s first industry.”King is chronicling the importance of commercial fishing in Alaska’s history as part of a 50th-anniversary project by the Department. of Fish and Game. It was salmon, he says, that drove the push.“The canned salmon plants started in the 1870s, and by the early 20th century, canned salmon was the largest industry in the state and generated 80 percent of the territorial tax revenues,” King said. “It had a position in the state economy that oil enjoys today.”Until statehood, the federal government managed Alaska’s salmon fisheries and used highly efficient traps to catch fish. At one time, more than 800 traps operated in Alaska, primarily for pinks in Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound.“Alaskans hated the traps with a passion right from the beginning, because they took jobs and revenues out of the communities,” King said. “Alaskans wanted to be out catching those fish themselves.”“When the state constitution was being crafted in 1955-56, the delegates did not want to micro-manage fisheries, so they didn’t ban fish traps outright,” he excplained, “But they did put in a clause that said there will be no exclusive right of fishery allowed in the state. And they put in the model principles of sustained yield and management that Alaska follows today.”The 55 delegates cleverly used the issue of fish traps to get people to the polls to ratify the constitution, King said.“They included a ballot measure that asked should the state ban fish traps. They knew that people were so opposed to the traps that they would go to vote on that, even if they had questions about the constitution. And in fact, the gimmick worked,” King said with a laugh. “The constitution passed by a 2-1 margin, but the measure to ban the traps passed 5-1. So a lot of people came out to voice their opinion about fish traps, and the constitution passed easily along the way.”The fisheries that the new state inherited from the feds were in bad shape. The salmon catch in 1959 of 25 million fish was the worst since the turn of the century, and total seafood production was just 324 million pounds.In contrast, salmon catches today regularly top 200 million fish, and more than 5 billion pounds of seafood cross Alaska docks.“The success in our fisheries today got started at statehood,” King said.The commemorative booklet on the role fisheries played in Alaska’s statehood will be available by the end of the year.“High-libut” pricesIt used to be that halibut prices would dip during the summer when salmon fisheries were in full swing. But that hasn’t been the case for several years, and this year is no exception.  Halibut prices are higher now than when the fishery opened in early March.Halibut prices are broken into three weight classes: under 20 pounds, 20-40 pounds and “40 ups.” At Kodiak, dock prices last week were $4.10 – $4.30 – and $4.60 – $4.70 per pound for larger sizes. At Homer, halibut prices were reported at $4.20 – $4.60 and $4.80. Dutch Harbor prices were holding steady at $4.05 – $4.30 and $4.65. In Southeast Alaska, halibut was fetching $4.40- $4.55 and $4.70 a pound at the docks.One big buyer called the Alaska halibut market ‘an amazing thing,’ adding that more fish have moved at higher prices than ever before. Another said despite its ‘elite’ and high-priced status, a ‘huge and expanding distribution network’ of smaller markets demands the popular fish.Federal data shows that about 16 million pounds remain out of Alaska’s 50 million pound catch limit for this year. Homer holds the lead for halibut landings, followed by Kodiak, Seward, Sitka, Juneau and Petersburg. Alaska’s halibut fishery ends in mid-November – and fewer fish are likely to be available for harvest next year.Chemicals and fish don’t mixCommon pesticides widely used by agriculture and livestock industries pose “a serious risk of extinction” for Northwest salmon, say federal experts. The findings were released in a draft report last week as part of a 10-year court battle between NOAA Fisheries and a coalition of fishing and environmental groups.A court ruled earlier this year that the Environmental Protection Agency must assess the effects of 37 pesticides on 28 salmon stocks that are listed as threatened or endangered. The court agreed that the chemicals had been placed on the market without a complete understanding of their biological effects.In the first of at least nine studies, researchers concluded that pesticides can harm salmon, even when they are used as approved by the EPA. The pesticides can affect the fishes’ sense of smell, their ability to feed and avoid predation. By law, the finding of jeopardy means changes must be made to protect the fish. The court issued interim measures requiring that pesticide users must apply toxic chemicals a certain distance from streams. That could be what the agencies propose as a permanent solution.The EPA results follow a stream of similar reports on how contaminants disrupt the chemical balance of aquatic creatures. Last year, for example, a study by Oregon State University and federal scientists showed how low levels of copper impairs the noses and avoidance ability of small salmon.“In the environment, that has some serious implications,” said study author Jason Sandahl. “If there are predators around and the fish are not able to respond to these danger signals in the water, they would be the next snack for these larger predators in the water.”Scientists for years have said federal agencies are underestimating the hazard pesticides pose to salmon. The collapse of West Coast salmon stocks this summer drew headlines to the fact that chemicals and fish don’t mix.<COL>Salmon pushed statehood<COL>2008-08-20<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/11/%e2%80%9coiled%e2%80%9d-alaskans-eligible/<COL>“Oiled” Alaskans eligibleby Laine WelchAfter waiting nearly 20 years, thousands of ‘oiled’ Alaskans are now set to get checks from Exxon before Christmas. The money – $507 million – comes from damage awards stemming from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. More than 32,000 Alaskans are eligible for settlement checks, 80 percent are fishermen.Holiday hopes could be dashed, however, unless an appeal by Sea Hawk Seafoods is kicked to the curb this month in an Anchorage courtroom. Sea Hawk, a former Prince William Sound fish processor, has filed a lawsuit to reshuffle the long agreed upon payment amounts and boost its share by $7.6 million.“That would basically alter the plan of allocation that took almost 10 years to build,” said Andrew Ott, a plaintiffs’ attorney in Kodiak.The legal wrangling could set back payments to all claimants for years. Ott, along with Oiled Fishermen’s Frank Mullen of Homer, said the court does not appear to be very sympathetic to the case. Early court briefs called Sea Hawk’s motion “at best highly disruptive of ongoing proceedings, and at worst divisive and ill-considered.”“No one can second guess the judge, but at first blush, it does seem to be the direction the judge is going,” Ott said. “I hope this will just go away and we can move forward (with the distributions) very quickly.”“My hope is that Sea Hawk pays all expenses associated with their last minute grab,” Mullen added in an email.Even Exxon lawyers have joined the call for a quick resolution to the case. “This litigation has gone on long enough, and Sea Hawk should not be permitted to prolong it,” Exxon attorneys told the Anchorage Daily News/HighlinerIf the Sea Hawk case is settled on the Nov. 15 target date, Exxon checks would be distributed before Christmas. By then, oil spill plaintiffs might also know the status of the additional $488 million in interest payments that Exxon has appealed.“That is now on a briefing schedule with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and they may come out with a ruling by year’s end,” Ott said, “but more likely in early 2009.”Fish ‘organic’ for pigs, not people – After decades of debate, the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) has made its final recommendations on what aquaculture products are considered ‘organic.’ Getting the seal of approval are wild-caught forage fish that are used as feeds for farmed fish and livestock. But wild-caught fish to feed humans did not make the   ‘organic’ grade.“It defines common sense and logic,” said Kate Troll, executive director of the Alaska Conservation Alliance. Troll worked for years with the NOSB on behalf of Alaska’s seafood industry as a former fishery specialist with the state Commerce Department.“When we were dealing with trying to get Alaska salmon into the organic program, the biggest obstacle was ‘we don’t know where they feed or what they’re living off of.’ But you can say that same thing of the wild fish they are certifying,” Troll fumed.Troll and other critics claim that the same standards are not applied to other ‘organic’ products.“They certify bees that make honey – and they migrate over thousands of miles. You don’t know where the bees have been. A lot of the rain that falls on organic crops – you don’t know where the rainfall has been either,” Troll said. “Wild fish are held to a higher bar.”Forage fish, such as sardines, anchovies and menhaden, account for 37 percent of all fish taken from the world’s oceans each year. Nearly all of the fish are ground up and used as oils and feeds for livestock, poultry and farmed fish.Pigs and chickens eat six times more seafood than U.S. consumers, according to U.N. reports.  Critics claim the forage fish industry is “squandering a precious human food resource and disregarding the overfishing crisis in world oceans.’Meanwhile, Alaska seafood producers will continue touting their  popular “wild,” “sustainable” and “safe” messages in the marketplace. Troll said the USDA ‘organic’ brand does have market clout.“It assures consumers that it is pure and free of contaminants and healthy to eat. It’s a term they connect with.”The NOSB  is accepting public comments through Monday, November 3rd. The USDA could approve the standards by the end of November. www.regulations.gov – select Docket No. AMS-AMS-08-0083       True Food Network Action Alert http://ga3.org/campaign/NOSBaquaMariculture means jobs-The Alaska Shellfish Growers Association meets in Anchorage this week, and along with bi-valves, they’ll be talking jobs.There are 26 shellfish farms operating now in Alaska, mostly for oysters. The value of the crop last year was a half million dollars.  Some estimate the industry could be worth $70 million or more, just in Southeast, and provide good jobs in rural regions.“If we look at what are the opportunities in Alaska for year round sustainable jobs in Southeast, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula and along the Aleutians, the shellfish industry is one of the best options we have,” said John Sund of the Alaska Oceans Center in Ketchikan. “We need to help the industry grow.”Rodger Painter of Tenass Pass farms near Juneau said growers have learned to mechanize more parts of their operation, and are using waves and tides to turn their oyster crops.  An offshoot for any coastal region could be seaweed farms – especially kelp, which is a $2 billion industry in Japan. Nori, for example, is a staple food throughout Asia, and is loaded with nutrients. Kelp provides alginin, an edible material widely used in ice cream and cosmetics. The seaweed industry is considered ‘untapped’ in North America.Painter said St. Lawrence Islanders were interested in kelp farming but no funds were available to jump start a project. Mariculture programs are faring better elsewhere – a new center in Homer will serve growers at Kachemak Bay, king crab are being grown at the Alutiiq Pride Hatchery at Seward, the new Oceans Center at  Ketchikan aims to be a world leader in mariculture, and the state’s largest shellfish nursery at Naukiti on Prince of Wales Island has helped replace timber as a leading industry.Mariculture jobs could help slow the out-migration from rural Alaska,  Painter believes.“It’s very scary. People are fleeing rural Alaska and coastal villages,” he said. “We can’t necessarily solve the problem of high costs of groceries and fuel, but maybe we can provide some jobs.”The Alaska Shellfish Growers Association meets Nov. 7-8 at the UAA Commons Conference Center in Anchorage. It includes the famous ASGA oyster slurp.rodgerpainter@hotmail.com‘Catfish’ takes on new meaning – Animal activists are rebranding fish as ‘sea kittens.’ PETA – People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals – has launched a ‘Save the Sea Kittens’ campaign, saying “these adorable creatures are intelligent animals, each with their own unique personalities.”  PETA urges people to send messages to fishery managers to put a stop to ‘hunting’ – otherwise known as fishing, for sea kittens.

There will be no blue king crab fishery at St. Matthew Island, despite earlier indications that it would open for the first time in a decade.Meanwhile, the basic economic tenet of supply and demand will be the big price driver for crab lovers. U.S. buyers are tightening their belts due to the sluggish economy, but that’s not the case for Alaska’s number one customer: Japan. Market analyst Ken Talley of Seafood Trend said demand for Alaska king crab is strong in Japan, and that should be reflected in higher prices.Through June, imports of frozen crab into Japan had fallen 27 percent from the previous year to 9.3 million pounds. That pushed up wholesale prices by 41.5 percent per pound on average compared to last year, Talley said. If the king crab supply remains down in the Russian Far East fisheries this fall (which traditionally imports 90 percent of its king crab to Japan), Japan  could be an aggressive buyer of Alaskan king crab.In the U.S., retail sales are key to the king crab market, and with reduced supplies, prices have increased over the last year by nearly 40% for imported product. Talley said some major U.S. buyers may forego king crab until after the prime holiday sales season when prices may soften. The U.S. market wants king crab, but will only pay so much for it – and American buyers can expect stiff competition from both Japan and Europe.Last year Bering Sea (Bristol Bay) crabbers averaged about $4.45 a pound for red king crab. Alaska competes with Russia and Norway in world king crab markets, and fishermen there also are negotiating for higher prices this year. Alaska’s fishery gets  underway on October 15th.Frankenfoods coming to a store near you – Along with farmed fish, Alaska salmon will soon face more competition – from FrankenFish. Last week the Food and Drug Administration officially proposed regulations that will allow genetically modified fish and animals on America’s dinner plates.The FDA has been reviewing “transgenic” animals and animal products since the early 1990s but had never formally or publicly clarified the approval process for bringing them to the marketplace. Genetic engineering is already widely used in agriculture to produce higher-yielding or disease-resistant crops. But it will mark the first time that modified animals are Ok’d for human consumption.Dubbed “Frankenfoods” by detractors, the process involves changing a creature’s genes or switching them with other animals for a specific purpose. In normal salmon, for example, the gene that controls the production of growth hormone is activated by light, so the fish usually grow only during the sunny summer months. But by attaching part of a specific gene from an ocean pout, the end product is salmon that make growth hormone all year round.Two companies – AquaBounty and A/F Protein  – have produced genetically modified salmon that grow 10 to 30 times faster than normal fish. Both are eagerly waiting for the nod by the FDA to ship the salmon to U.S. markets.No fish or animals have been approved yet for human consumption, but the agency is reviewing about 50 applications. Along with salmon, they include chickens that lay healthier eggs, cows that are immune to mad cow disease, pigs with organs that can be transplanted into humans without being rejected – even hypoallergenic dogs and cats.The genetically modified foods will be regulated in the same way as veterinary drugs, meaning they’ll undergo a safety review process. But no matter how they are modified, you won’t know it — no labeling will be required that informs consumers that an animal has been genetically altered. The FDA will take public comments until Nov. 18 before finalizing the ‘frankenfoods’ regulations.Trash tells all!  Last Saturday marked the 23rd annual International Coastal Cleanup day championed by the Ocean Conservancy. Unlike other marine litter-thons, volunteers not only clean up trash from beaches, oceans, lakes and rivers – they also record everything they find. The cleanup provides the only global snapshot of trash in world waters and identifies its sources.Last April on Earth Day, for example, nearly 400,000 volunteers scoured 33,000 miles of shoreline in 76 countries and in 45 U.S. states. In all, they picked up 6 million pounds of trash in just one day. Then, the Ocean Conservancy cataloged the trash into more than 7 million items. It revealed a general carelessness about what’s being tossed into the water. Nearly 60 percent of the trash was related to food wrappings and beverage containers, also cups, plates and plastic eating utensils. Balloon bits and strings, tires, wires and building materials were also plentiful.  A whopping 33 percent of the ocean trash came from smokers. Beach combers and divers collected 2.3 million cigarette butts, filters and cigar tips. Just over 6 percent of the trash collected came from fishing gear.Results of the Ocean Conservancy Cleanup counts are presented in an annual report, which is the most comprehensive collection of marine debris data in the world. A recent Gallup poll showed that nearly 80% of those surveyed said they have made lifestyle changes to protect oceans and the environment.<COL>Crab market looks good<COL>2008-09-24<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/12/%e2%80%98low-catch%e2%80%99-salmon-supply/<COL>‘Low Catch’ salmon supply‘Reduced supply’ summed up all of the Pacific coast salmon fisheries this year, and Alaska was no exception. Despite the lower catch, wild salmon is still holding its own in world markets.Alaska’s statewide harvest of 146 million salmon was a decrease of 31.4 percent from the previous year – still, it was the 16th largest catch since statehood in 1959. And although the value of the catch was down, it topped $400 million at the docks for the second consecutive year.Market expert Ken Talley of Seafood Trend said the preliminary value of $409 million decreased less than 2 percent from Alaska’s 2007 salmon fishery, and increased more than 18 percent from 2006. All species except sockeye (reds) fetched higher prices for Alaska fishermen.Although statewide landings of sockeye fell 18 percent this year, the average base price failed to gain overall, dropping 2.5 percent to $.78/lb. At Bristol Bay, home to the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery, landings dropped 6.7 percent and prices increased only a penny over last year.  Sockeye salmon continue to make inroads into the U.S. market, Talley said, especially during the summer “when fresh fish make a splash at retail.”Chinook (king) salmon were hard to find this year, coming in at just 351,000 fish, down nearly 40% from last year. The scarce kings boosted prices with Copper River fish averaging $5.87/lb, followed by troll caught fish from Southeast at $5.33/lb.Coho (silver) salmon continued their gains in price and popularity. Alaska landings of 4.4 million were a gain of 22 percent, and dock prices jumped 26 percent from last year. Troll caught cohos led the way at $1.57/lb on average.The chum salmon harvest, which topped 18 million fish, continued to show the biggest gains, with dock prices shooting up by 56 percent.  Pinks saw landings of 84 million, a drop of nearly 42 percent, while the average pink price rose 52.6 percent. Alaska fishermen averaged 29-cents a pound for their pink salmon, up a dime.The $409 million paid to fishermen represents only about 40 percent of the overall value of Alaska’s 2008 salmon fishery, said industry analyst Chris McDowell.“It’s the first wholesale prices that capture all the rest of that value – payment to harvesters, processing activity in Alaska, payment to processors, use of goods and services from vendors like welders and truck drivers and shipping,” he said.“For example, the value of the 2007 salmon catch was $416 million – add in first wholesale and it pushes the industry closer to $900 million.”The state Dept. of Revenue publishes that information in its Alaska Salmon Price Report, which includes yearly sales volumes and values for six major products – canned salmon, frozen and fresh headed/gutted fish, frozen and fresh fillets, and salmon roe. The ASPR is available in the spring.Halibut hitAlaska longliners are bracing for more cuts to their halibut catches again next year. Halibut scientists are recommending a 10 percent reduction to 54 million pounds for all fishing regions, covering the West Coast to the Bering Sea. The decrease comes on the heels of a 9 percent cut in this year’s halibut fishery.Alaska always gets the lion’s share of the halibut catch and fishermen will harvest 46 million pounds, if managers opt for the recommendations. That compares to 50 million pounds this year. Southeast Alaska would again take the biggest hit – a proposed catch limit of 4.5 million pounds is a drop of almost 30 percent for the second year in a row.”It’s like a punch in the stomach,” Linda Behnken of the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association told KCAW/Sitka. “It’s going to be painful for a lot of people. It’s going to be particularly difficult for people who are still paying off loans on quota shares.”For Alaska’s largest halibut hole in the Central Gulf, a catch limit of 22.5 million pounds is a 7 percent drop. The Western Gulf would get a bit of a bump to nearly 12 million pounds. The Aleutians and Bering Sea regions could see a slight dip to 7.5 million pounds of halibutThe declines in catches stem from two primary reasons:  a new method of assessing the halibut stocks is being done coast wide, instead of by regions, as research shows that halibut range much further than previously thought.Secondly, although the stocks are still abundant, they have been on a downturn as two strong year classes from the late 1990s leave the fishery. Two more are poised to enter the halibut fishery in the near future, said Bruce Leaman, director of the International Pacific Halibut Commission. But those recruits are growing slowly.”We think the low growth rates are associated both with high density of not only halibut, but also arrowtooth flounder in the Gulf of Alaska,” Leaman said, “and that is probably depressing growth rates pretty substantially.”ALFA’s Behnken said the halibut industry is not happy about the catch cuts, but supports the science.“I think people feel like they will follow the science and support being conservative and rebuilding the stocks.”The IPHC will make its final decision on the 2009 halibut catch limits in January in Victoria, B.C. The fishery typically begins in early March and runs through mid-November.Energy from eels and algaeResearchers at Yale University have found that eels generate more electricity than a lot of electrical devices, and are applying what the eels do naturally to artificial cells. Electric eels have specialized cells called electrocytes to channel the output of electricity the same way that nerve cells fire up. The goal is to replicate electric eel cells to act as bio-batteries for medical implants. According to EcoGeek, the biggest eels can produce charges up to 600 watts of electricity, enough to briefly power your computer, monitor, printer and office lighting simultaneously.The Carbon Trust, a private company in the U.K., aims to commercialize algae biofuel by 2020 and have it provide a large portion of the country’s fuel needs. Micro-algae can be refined for use in renewable transport fuels, and is a favored candidate    because it takes few resources to grow and does not compete for food production -  a major drawback of bio-fuels like ethanol, made from corn.Initial forecasts suggest that algae-based biofuels could replace 12% of annual global jet fuel consumption, or 6% of road transport diesel by 2030.  Find out more about the Carbon Trust’s Algae Biofuels Challenge at www.carbontrust.co.uk/<COL>‘Low Catch’ salmon supply<COL>2008-12-03<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/08/few-sell-direct/<COL>Few sell directLaine WelchBuying locally produced foods is becoming a national trend — but it hasn’t made a dent at the local docks. At Kodiak, for example, fishermen seldom sell their catch directly to customers.“It seems to go in spurts,” said Mike Gardiner, a longtime Environmental Health officer with the state Dept. of Environmental Conservation. “Five or six fishermen will be interested one year, and the next year there’s no interest.”It is not a complicated process that demands a lot of paperwork or permits, Gardiner said, adding that fishermen do not even need a direct marketing permit to sell to individual customers or to local stores or restaurants.A fisherman does need a “mobile retail vendor” permit if he wants to sell his catch at another location, say, from iced totes in the back of a pick up truck along side of a road.“The mobile retail vendor would have to wash his fish with approved water, have a means to clean his equipment and use a permitted fish processor as a commissary,” Gardiner explained.Of course, fishermen selling directly from their boats must account for their catches, said Kodiak fishery manager Jeff Wadle.“They have to get a catcher/seller permit and fill out a fish ticket and let us know how many they sell,” he said.Wadle agreed that local fishermen haven’t shown much interest in selling their catches directly to customers.“Typically, we have several fishermen who live in the Lower 48, especially California and Seattle, who have their fish custom processed locally and take it to the Lower 48 and sell it themselves. That’s fairly common. But not so much around town,” Wadle said.Requirements are a bit different for dockside sales of halibut — which fall under federal management. Fishermen need a “registered buyer” permit, they must off-load and weigh the fish at a landing site and have the catch debited from their quota shares.“Then they can sell it directly from their boats,” an enforcement agent explained, adding that they must fill out (and save) receipts listing the date, time and poundage sold. A fisherman also needs a product transfer report if the halibut is shipped somewhere before selling it elsewhere.Based on an informal survey, fishermen in other Alaska ports appear to have a similar disinterest in dockside fish sales. DEC’s Gardiner speculates it might be due to convenient arrangements with processors, who can also provide ice and other amenities.“It’s just the way it’s always been done,” said a Kodiak fishermen. “And it’s kind of a hassle to hold back some fish to sell from the boat when you’ve got a big haul.”A Kodiak sales tax of 6 percent would apply, but a City spokesperson said “dock side sales are so infrequent, we have not felt the need to track it.”Get more information about dock side sales at http://www.dec.state.ak.us/eh/Fish school scores fundsKetchikan is fast becoming a leader in training young Alaskans in fishery science and management careers. Its Fisheries Technology program through the University of Alaska received a $170,000 grant from the US Dept. of Agriculture to expand its programs, and to partner with shellfish farmers and researchers. Funds are also available for tuition and travel, said professor and program chair, Kate Sullivan.The program offers one-year certificates and two-year degrees in fisheries technology. Students work alongside fisheries professionals in hatcheries and management agencies during required hands-on internships.It is the third year that the Ketchikan program has received a grant through USDA’s Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CREES), which includes fisheries and aquaculture.Ketchikan aims to be a world leader in shellfish aquaculture at its new Oceans Alaska center.“There really isn’t a lot of support for shellfish farmers who live and work in remote regions of Southeast Alaska, and it is a good opportunity to enhance their incomes,” Sullivan said.The Fish Tech program is available to students anywhere in Alaska via distant delivery.Sullivan said the program opens the door to good paying careers in home communities.“There is tremendous demand. Over half of the state’s fisheries management workforce will retire in the next 5 to10 years,” she said.Many opportunities are available under USDA/CREES for Alaska and Hawaii Native-serving institutions, which is a federal designation from the Dept. of Education.Fish watchThe new method of apportioning halibut catches in Alaska regions will be explained at a workshop in Bellevue, Wash. on Sept. 4.

Last Friday, 11 crab boats were still out on the grounds, out of a total fleet of 77, three more than last year said Forrest Bowers, area manager at Dutch Harbor.The crabbers had taken nearly all of the their 18 million pound catch limit, with “400,000 pounds  “remaining on the IFQ tag,” Bowers said, adding that pot lifts were a bit lighter this year.”It’s running around 23 legal crab per pot lift, compared to 28 last year, and 34 in 2006,” he said.  The crab are bigger, and overall the catch is looking good.”The average weight has been about 6.6 pounds per crab, a little bit above average,” Bowers said. “In general, the processors and fishermen have been really happy with the shell condition and meat fill, so that’s been good.”Also good, crab prices.”We’re seeing $5-pound on the fish tickets,” Bowers said. That compares to an average base of $4.19-pound last year. Post season adjustments based on crab sales will likely push that price higher.The price boost stems from buying interest from Japan – Alaska’s no.1 red king crab customer – combined with reduced deliveries from Russia. Japan purchased nearly  65 percent of the Bristol Bay king crab pack, said Ken Talley of Seafood Trend. That’s good news as the U.S. economy continues to tank. China appears to be an export market in the making, Talley said. Exports of king crab to Hong Kong, for example, have soared this year to nearly 100,000 pounds.Bowers called this year’s Bristol Bay crab fishery “uneventful.”“Since 2005 for red king crab there haven’t been any injuries or major accidents, like vessel sinkings in the crab fishery. The industry is able to go out and prosecute the fishery efficiently and take care of the business at hand.”Golden king and Tanner crab fisheries are ongoing in the Bering Sea, and Dutch Harbor is gearing up for the snow crab fleet next month. Prices for golden crab are ranging from $3 to $3.75; the base price for Tanners jumped from $1.25-$1.65.Here comes herringCatch numbers are trickling in for 2009 herring fisheries. The spring herring are valued primarily for their eggs, or roe, nearly all of which goes to Japan. Ten percent of roe as a percent of body weight is the industry standard; anything above usually fetches a higher price.Alaska’s herring fisheries begin at Sitka Sound, where the ’09 catch may see a boost to 15,308 tons, an increase of 800 tons from 2008.  Sitka’s fishery is limited to about 100 permit holders, who averaged $600/ton in ’08, up from $475. The Sitka fishery can last just a few days and this year was valued at $9 million to fishermen.Most Alaska regions enjoyed higher tonnage prices for roe herring, except for the state’s biggest fishery at Togiak in Bristol Bay. The catch there of 20,000 tons averaged $125/ton for seiners, $144/ton for setnetters. Unfortunately, except for a small sac roe fishery at Norton Sound, a lack of buyers canceled herring fisheries from Security Cove to Port Clarence.   Alaska’s 2008 statewide herring sac roe harvest of  39,421 tons was valued at $13.2 million to fishermen.Cook Inlet cashes inHerring fishermen at Upper Cook Inlet take an entirely different approach to roe herring and get $2,000 per ton!“Here on the east side the fish are sold in the food bait fishery. The halibut and king salmon sport fisheries buy it for bait, and also the commercial fishermen use it for halibut bait,” explained Jeff Fox,   area management biologist at ADF&G in Soldotna.Between 15-20 small setnet operators take part in the herring fishery, catching from 15 to 30 tons a year. Fox said the herring are caught about a week before they are ripe –”They prefer the green herring because it stays on the hook better. So that’s why it commands a better price than for the sac roe.”Fishermen and processors sell the fresh herring in buckets for $1/lb; if it’s packaged and frozen, it can fetch up to $12 for seven fish. Fox said demand for herring bait far exceeds the supply.”Right now people  bring in fish from other places and break it up into smaller quantities and package it for the sport industry. If we caught 50 tons, that probably wouldn’t be necessary,” Fox said.”Years ago they would buy herring from Dutch Harbor or Kodiak; now they buy it from Canada, thaw it and repackage it for sale.”So, at $2,000 per ton, why aren’t more Cook Inlet fishermen going after roe herring?  It’s very labor intensive in tough weather, Fox said. The fish come through in smaller numbers and the fishery lasts about a month.”It’s cold, it’s windy and it’s a lot of work,” he said.Seafood stallsSeafood marketers have their work cut out for them, as cash strapped Americans cut back on eating out and on home food costs. Packaged Facts, a New York-based research group that tracks national food trends, predicts that U.S. seafood consumption will drop below 16 pounds per person by next year, then rebound in 2010. Each American ate 16.3 pounds of fish and shellfish last year, a 1.2 percent decline from 2006.Packaged Facts said the U.S. recession is hurting sales of both fresh and frozen seafood at foodservice, where most fish is eaten, and at retail outlets.  The declines in sales of higher priced seafoods could boost sales of canned fish and other lower priced  products.PF said seafood marketers can reverse the downward trend by emphasizing the health benefits of seafood. Also, the ‘sustainability’ message is gaining momentum with more consumers who are concerned with overfishing and environmentally harmful fishing methods.That gives Alaska seafood an advantage, said Ray Riutta , director of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.”Our sustainability message will be front and center in our marketing campaigns over the next couple of years,” he said. Equally as important, Riutta said the Alaska seafood brand scores high for food safety.‘The fact that it comes from Alaska – buyers breathe a sigh of relief because they know it’s safe.”America’s seafood favorites have remained largely the same for the past 10 years.     Shrimp is the #1 favorite, followed by canned tuna, salmon, pollock and tilapia. Salmon has shown the strongest gains of all seafood, with each American eating 2.2 pounds on average last year.<COL>Crab above average size<COL>2008-12-17<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/11/are-you-a-reality-star/<COL>Are you a reality star?by Laine WelchThe search is on for a host for a new cable television show that takes viewers out to sea.“There are so many extreme boats with incredible stories.

The show will feature everything it takes to live and work on the water,” he added.The maritime show will be modeled after the ‘Extreme Trains’ series now airing on the History Channel. The task now is to find a good host. The ideal candidate will be a male in the early 30s to 40s who has “insider” experience and a “kid in a candy store” kind of excitement about life at sea, Grinstein said. He pointed to Geo Beach of Homer, host of the “Tougher in Alaska” series, as a character who is “brimming over with personality that people can really connect with.”“It’s a weird formula as far as finding these real characters, who also have credibility and can do the job. We’re not just asking them to sit down and be a talking head or just stand by and watch. We’re asking them to take us somewhere and engage the people they are interacting with and the viewers,” Grinstein said.Tiger Aspect Productions will be doing casting calls at Pacific Marine Expo this month in Seattle.“I will be there to meet anyone who swings by, and we can do a casting session right there. People can be on camera and do some interviews,” Grinstein said.Anyone who is the ‘real deal’ is encouraged to send a recent photo and short bio to     fred.grinstein@tigeraspectusa.com or call (212) 774-8798.Expo at 40 – Pacific Marine Expo, now in its 40th year, is an annual trek to Seattle for anyone involved in the fishing industry. Today, when a click and credit card can get you anything you want via the internet, Expo continues to attract plenty of vendors and visitors.“We’re often asked that question,” said Expo director Bob Callahan. “The facts are people come to trade shows to see and touch new products while they’re talking to a company representative. These are things you can’t experience on the internet. They also come to learn the latest trends, catch up with old friends and network with new ones. So over the years our attendance has been strong and we are not seeing any decline. People love the face to face interaction.”Callahan said nearly 600 exhibitor booths will be on the show floor this month. Seminars and workshops are targeted to safety, workboats, commercial fisheries and charter operators. Each day will end with a free happy hour, and drawings for a Sea Hawks game, $100 gas cards and trips to Las Vegas.By early November, Expo attendance was “tracking good,” Callahan said. “We expect to close with about 10,000 attendees.”Pacific Marine Expo is Nov. 20-22 at the Qwest Center. www.pacificmarineexpo.comCrab dip –  Kodiak crabbers will compete for a reduced catch of bairdi Tanners when the fishery opens in mid-January. Bairdi are the bigger cousin of snow crab, caught in the Bering Sea.  State managers set the Kodiak crab harvest at 400,000 pounds, down from 500,000 last season.The crab fishery occurs primarily in two eastside districts around the island, and the popular nearby Chiniak, Ugak and Kiluda Bays will be off limits.“The crab population in those bays was down a little bit in the surveys, and those areas tend to be important for recruitment into the stocks. So as an added conservation measure we’re keeping them closed this year,” said regional manager Nick Sagalkin.Chignik will remain closed to Tanners; a small catch of 275,000 pounds is allowed for the Southern Alaska Peninsula.In its heyday during the 1970s, the Kodiak fishery produced more than 30 million pounds of Tanner crab. Two years ago the catch topped 2 million, but the year class that was sustaining the fishery has been dwindling. The future bodes well for bigger harvests for Kodiak and down through the Aleutians, Sagalkin said.“We are still seeing the strong year class that we first noticed several years ago. That should start recruiting into the fishery within the next two to three years,” he said.The fishery attracts a fleet of about 35 local crabbers, who averaged $2/lb for their catch last season. Traditionally, bairdi crab has gone almost exclusively to Japan, but more markets are getting a taste for Tanners.Pollock precautions- Alaska fishery managers are world famous for their cautious approach to setting annual catch limits. An example is Alaska pollock in the Bering Sea, where stocks have taken a tumble from record highs during the past decade. Pollock harvests have topped three billion pounds most recently, but they may be reduced by nearly half while the stocks take a year or two to rebuild.“We buffer downward to account for uncertainty,” said James Ianelli, a federal  fishery statistician at the Alaska Science Center in Seattle.But it is hardly a “collapse” of the world’s largest food fishery, as some headlines have screamed.Scientists and industry stakeholders have been braced for the pollock decline for several years.  Surveys two years ago indicated a big drop in the population caused by poor recruitment of smaller pollock into the fishery. It takes three to five years for pollock to reach maturity, and Ianelli said a strong year class from 2006 appears poised to soon enter the pollock fishery.Ianelli and industry stakeholders are critical of claims by environmental groups that the Alaska pollock fishery is being mismanaged and overfished.“We always err on the side of caution,” Ianelli said.Alaska fishery managers will set 2009 catch quotas for pollock, cod and other groundfish in December.Helpful fish funds – In the spirit of ‘giving back’, American Seafoods Company is again offering $30,000 in donations as part of its annual community grant program. Since 1997 ASC has awarded $75,000 each year to projects throughout rural Alaska that tackle hunger, housing, education and cultural programs.Award recipients in February included the American Red Cross/Alaska, St. Paul Volunteer Fire Dept. and Ketchikan schools. Twenty-three educational scholarships were awarded in May totaling $14,600.  Apply online at www.americanseafoods.com, or by contacting Kim Lynch at kim.lynch@americanseafoods.com or 206-256-2659. Deadline to apply is Monday, Nov. 24. Awards will be announced on Dec. 8.<COL>Are you a reality star?<COL>2008-11-12<ROW>http://homertribune.com/2008/12/re-inventing-cod-pieces/<COL>Re-inventing cod piecesOn any given month in Alaska 7,260 fishermen are out on the water plying their trade. That number jumps to 20,137 per month at the peak of salmon season each summer. Add in jobs in seafood processing, transportation, management and other support services and it brings the number of fishing industry related jobs to at least 54,000 a month.Those are just a few of the findings revealed by the state Labor Dept in the November issue of Alaska Economic Trends, which tracks employment in the fishing industry from 1988 through 2007.Fish harvesting jobs have proven tough to track because they don’t generate payroll records and other documents used to calculate employment in other industries. The state has projects underway to compile more information on the working profiles of the ‘boots on deck’ fishermen, and their economic importance to coastal communities.A sketch of the findings shows that Alaska’s fish harvesting employment decreased slightly in 2007, losing 54 jobs, a 0.7 percent drop. Fish harvesting jobs decreased by 17 percent, or 1,446 jobs, since 2000. The biggest drop occurred between 2001 and 2002 when employment fell by 791 jobs, mostly due to depressed salmon markets.Salmon provided more than half of all fishing jobs, and 30 percent of those workers were on the job at Bristol Bay. Bristol Bay draws more fishermen than any other fishery in the state  – 2,303 permits fished in 2007.Groundfish landings in Alaska waters topped 4 billion pounds and generated 1,182 jobs in 2007; the halibut fishery put another 1,246 fishermen to work.Alaska’s largest crab fisheries in the Bering Sea generated 418 jobs in 2007 – a 40 percent drop from 2002 when the fisheries provided 692 jobs. The crab fleet dropped from 252 boats in 2003 to about 75 boats for king and snow crab in 2007.That’s due to the ‘rationalized’ crab quota share program that was implemented in 2005. Conversely, crab fishing jobs in the Southeast region, the state’s second largest producer, has fluctuated little since 2003.In all, Alaska’s fishing industry contributed $770 million to the state’s GDP in 2007 – a contribution that would be higher but for the big portion that goes south with nonresident workers and seafood companies. Seafood accounted for fully half of Alaska’s total exports in 2006 and 2007, valued at $2 billion.  Find the fishing industry employment report at  http://labor.alaska.gov/trends/nov08.pdfKids pick Alaska pollock – Trendy new lunch entrees made from Alaska pollock got “kid approved” at schools in Fairbanks and Kenai. The selections, which were taste tested in November, include po’boy sandwiches, fish strips with dips, salads and a FBLT.”Many people think that getting fish into Alaska schools should be easy because it is a fish producing state,” said Pat Shanahan, program director for the Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers trade group. ”But the schools have the same challenges that any in the Lower 48 face – getting a product that kids really like at an affordable price. It’s not a slam dunk.”For three years GAPP has been working closely with national school nutrition programs to explain the best seafood buying tips, and has developed six snazzy new recipes.”I think our industry has been a little behind in updating its recipes for school lunches. Now we’ve got a whole range of options along the lines of what you’d find in a normal restaurant,” Shanahan said.The Baja salad – made with spicy, cornmeal crusted fish strips and served in a taco shell bowl  was the favorite at North Star High School, said Amy Rouse, director of nutrition services for the Fairbanks school district.“The kids want something a little more adult. When the fish is cooking the whole place smells like Doritos. The kids love it,” Rouse said.The pollock entrees are the first fish item ever used in Fairbanks schools. Rouse said the fish recipes are easy to adapt with ingredients on hand, and the mild taste and affordability of Alaska pollock make it especially appealing for school lunch programs.“We plan to permanently add at least two of the fish items to our menu next year,” Rouse said.Alaska pollock entrees are also on school menus in Seattle and Houston. Shanahan said GAPP is also getting nibbles from several other school districts, both in and outside of Alaska. The group also is preparing a seminar called Making Fish Affordable for a national conference to address spiraling food costs.“It’s particularly complicated for schools because more students are signing up for the federal free and reduced lunch programs, and food costs are going up at the same time. We want them to know that fish does not have to be eliminated from their menu,” she said.Shanahan suggested that Alaska schools partner to reduce food costs.”Because of their remoteness it is really beneficial for the schools to combine their buying power and transportation costs on food items and I know they work closely to do that. So I’m hoping they’ll be able to take advantage of the success this program is having and make it even more affordable to their schools.”  www.gapp.orgPay up time- Alaska fishermen who hold quota shares of halibut, sablefish (black cod) and crab pay an annual fee to the federal government to cover the costs of managing and enforcing those fisheries. The fee is based on the dock prices throughout each fishery and averaged across the state. Bills are in the mail to 2,302 Alaska longliners, down 80 from last year, said Troie Zuniga, fee coordinator at NOAA Fisheries in Juneau.”The overall value for halibut is $175 million and about $69 million for black cod.  That’s $3 million higher than the 2007 value for halibut and $7 million higher for black cod,” Zuniga said.For both fisheries, the 1.4 percent fee is up slightly from last year (1.2 percent), and yielded $3.4 million for coverage costs. Fee managers collect the catch data through September and don’t include the most recent prices. But the fish prices for 2008 were up across the board.“This year’s average price for halibut was $3.70 per pound and $2.58 for black cod. That compares to $3.49 and $2.08 from last year,” Zuniga said.For Bering Sea king and Tanner crab, the 2007/08 fishery had a landing value of $202 million, as reported by 20 registered crab receivers. Price per pound information for the crab is confidential to the receivers.“We bill each RCR based on their own price data,” Zuniga said, “soso those prices would be confidential to the RCR.”Find the IFQ reports and pay fees online at www.alaskafisheries.noaa.gov .  Payments are due by Jan. 31.<COL>Re-inventing cod pieces<COL>2008-12-10<ROW>
