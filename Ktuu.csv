Fish and Game is operating under a new plan officials say provides opportunity, yet there are new restrictions to be aware of.The Kenai River has been closed to king salmon fishing this summer, but that is about to change downriver of the Kenai’s Mile 18 on July 1.“At that that time, king fishing will be allowed in a small portion of the Kenai River,” said Fish and Game biologist Robert Begich.Fish and Game calls it an opportunity when the late run is projected to total less than 20,000 fish, just inside the escapement goal -- but asks anglers to respect the rules.“The big thing for July 1 is bait is prohibited in the Kenai River, period -- regardless of what species of fish you're fishing for,” Begich said.This year, that decision also means changes for the commercial set netters in the upper Cook Inlet.“So when the in-river fishery goes to no bait, there is 36 hours available for the commercial set net fishery,” said Ricky Gease, executive director of the Kenai River Sportfishing Association.That's a big cut in fishing time. In February, commercial setnetters voiced their displeasure over new rules they say don't share the conservation burden equally.“The east side set net fishery has lost about 70 percent of its opportunity and that's pretty significant,” setnet fisherman Jim Butler said at the time.Chanel 2’s calls to east side setnetters weren't returned Friday.At KRSA, Gease disagrees with the setnetters’ position, saying the efficiency of both fisheries has been reduced.“If you allowed either one of them to go full-bore as a normal fishery we would quickly chew up the 4,000 kings that we have for available surplus,” Gease said.Fish and Game says the step-down measures could be worse, with closed beaches and catch-and-release fishing on the Kenai.Also new in fishing news: Keeping kings will be prohibited for the dip net fishery opening July 10 on the Kenai.Fish and Game asks anyone who has any questions about the new emergency orders to contact the department directly atits local offices.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

And every year the city has to clean up what is left behind.“We jokingly refer to it as a Woodstock without even having to advertise,” said Kenai Mayor Pat Porter.But this year the city hopes dipnetters will respect their beach a bit more than in years past. Kenai residents have complained that dipnetters left rotting fish carcasses on the beach along with other trash. Dipnetters can still clean their fish on the beach but the city asks that they dispose of the fish in the water or in trash bins.Porter said because of the popularity of dipnetting the city has had to install more restrooms, pay a high school group to clean up the beach and increase fines for people who don’t properly dispose of their fish.“The fine is $150 if you are not in compliance, but we are basically asking people to leave our beach the way that they found it,” Porter said. “It's a premiere beach; the citizens of Kenai are very proud of that.”The fee for parking on the beach also increased this year. It will now cost $20 dollars to park on the beach for dipnetting or camping. That money goes toward maintaining the restrooms and other amenities in the area.Those who dipnet must have a permit as well as a sport fishing license.Based on the preseason forecast the sockeye salmon run is expected to be above average for the Kenai this year, according to Department of Fish and Game officials. King salmon caught in dipnets cannot be brought out of the water and must be immediately released.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

While they don't make people sick in and of themselves, their detection indicates the presence of harmful bacteria like giardia -- which can only be detected by far more specific and expensive tests.The source of the elevated bacteria levels hasn’t been conclusively identified, but DEC says possible sources include birds feeding during low tides, a bird rookery in the area, and contamination from humans and pets. Although no action has yet been taken to restrict access to affected areas, a further spike in bacteria levels may prompt local officials to post warnings at area beaches until they fall to safe values.A 2010 DEC mitochondrial study -- allowing scientists to track bacteria back to the species from which they originated -- recorded most samples as coming from birds. While Stevens says the study shouldn't be taken as conclusive evidence that birds are to blame, he says that of the 55 samples examined that year only two each came from humans and dogs, with estimators at the beaches recently counting between 5,000 and 10,000 birds in the area."Over 80 percent of the samples came back with avian DNA," Stevens said. "It's just kind of a weight of evidence that the material is coming from the birds."One factor DEC sees behind the samples is the presence of numerous piles of fish guts left on area beaches by participants in the Kenai's dipnetting season. Stevens says a Kenai city ordinance requires dipnetters to throw fish waste into the river rather than leave it on the beach, and local authorities will post signs at beaches advising people of the law."It's a bird attractant that brings the birds to the beach," Stevens said.DEC jointly collected its samples with the City of Kenai on June 25 and June 30, as part of a state program operated under the federal BEACH Act meant to reduce cases of waterborne illnesses at public beaches nationwide. According to Stevens, DEC will continue to take samples twice weekly during July, with collections continuing at a slower rate into August.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Extremely high tides will chase dip-netters off the beach, and at extreme low tides, the city's boat launch will be closed. Negative low tides are expected for July 10-17, the first week of the fishery.Road and beach closures could also affect access to the sockeyes.Beaver Loop Road, which connects Kenai Spur Highway to Beach Access Road, near the city's boat launch, is closed for installation of culverts. The fish passage project is expected to be completed later in July. Drivers should plan on using Kalifornsky Beach Road or Bridge Access Road.Koch also said that on the South Shore beaches, the only access point will be at Dunes Road. (There had previously been an access point on Old Cannery Road.) Koch said the city added a second lane and second payment shack to get more traffic through.If camping and parking on the beach is inaccessable due to high tide, Koch says the city will open parking at the softball fields. Fishers and campers who have paid at the beach will not have to pay at the softball field. The city closed the core of Old Town Kenai to off-street parking after parking congestion made it impassable to fire engines. Kenai Police will enforce parking in Old Town.Another option often available to campers, the Kenai Landing, has closed this year. The landing's boat launch was closed last year, but the entire property has closed, and there will be no RV camping spots available there.The sockeye salmon personal use dip net fishery opens at 6 a.m. Thursday. It remains open 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily through July 31. Fishermen are not allowed to retain king salmon, due to an emergency order from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.After years of complaints of smelly fish carcasses spoiling on the beach, the City of Kenai last year enacted an ordinance requiring fish carcasses be thrown into the fast-moving waters of the river or Cook Inlet. Koch said participants are largely obliged."If we've got rules that make sense, they follow them," Koch said. "It's certainly the rare exception that they don't, but when you have 15,000 people, it doesn't take too many" to make a mess.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

She said she loves her town and the natural beauty of the area, like at nearby K-Beach, where Alaskans harvest sockeye salmon every year.But for Stroh, a budding fisherman herself, the beach is not just part of the scenery. It is a major part of the local economy.“Growing up on the beach, which is just across the road, I saw it every summer,” she said, referring to the annual parade of dipnetters and other anglers.When she saw that the beach was being destroyed by litter, she found it easy to stand up and push for a solution.“The way people treat the beach isn't right,” she said. “It’s not fair that they are coming, taking our resource, and not doing their share to keep up the environment.”Stroh took matters into her own hands.“It kind of started with a school assignment, which is called ‘Caring for the Kenai,’” she said. “The question that’s asked is, what is something I can do to better my community?"I actually took that essay and turned that into an actual project.”At first, there was some resistance.“She was kind of turned down by the city manager,” said Nancy Cranston, Courtney’s grandmother. “He said, 'Why is a 14 year-old girl trying to change things in Kenai?'”"No isn’t in her vocabulary," Cranston said. "I thought, this isn't right. I need to do something about this. That's how I started ‘Roc the Kenai,’ which stands for ‘respect our community.’”The movement gained support and got extra help through state funding. Courtney eventually got the rules changed, with enforcement in place and crews on hand that make the beach cleaner.If you talk to anyone who knows Courtney, what she accomplished is no surprise.“When Courtney's name comes up, [people say] oh yeah, I've heard of that kid,” says Alan Fields, Courtney’s principal at Kenai Central High School. Fields says people know Stroh as “the kid that works on the beach and helps clean up fish.”It is a lesson on commitment Courtney said she learned from her grandfather.“My grandpa, Charles Cranston, he inspires me a lot,” she said. “He doesn't give up. And I wasn't going to give up with this beach project.”Stroh said she is determined to make everything she does a success.“I just like getting out and actually doing something that matters and that can make a difference,” she said.What started as a project to save a beach has become a passion.As she chooses between colleges in Minnesota and Oregon, Courtney Stroh she wants to continue her work keeping the beaches clean by majoring in environmental science.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Sport fishermen asked for and received paired restrictions for setnetters and personal use fisheries, meaning if the kings don't come back in strong numbers, each group would face restrictions.“You know, everybody took hits in terms of what they're being asked for (in terms of) conservation and providing opportunity for all the user groups,” said Kenai River Sport Fishing Association President Rickey Gease.Commercial setnetter Jim Butler says his fishery has lost 70 percent of its opportunity to catch sockeye. “It's disappointing that the burden wasn't shared across the board.”The Upper Cook Inlet isn't scheduled to come up again until 2017, but the board can reconvene before than if needed.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The fund is seeking an additional 51 hours to fish.ADF&G says it exercised its authority to manage the salmon runs in accordance with the management plans developed by the Board of Fisheries.Pat Shields, a commercial fishery biologist with Fish and Game, says the department held task force meetings to determine how it should proceed to stay within healthy margins of the escapement goals to maximize salmon returns."These folks are used to fishing a lot of hours," Shields said. "If you look in the last 20 years, they fished many or most of the hours that are in the plan for additional hours."CIFF's president, Douglas Blossom, says he has six decades of fishing experience along Cook Inlet and other areas, but suffered during the fishery closures in 2012."Last year I thought we had the same decision and I spent about $50,000 getting ready and made less than $3,000 for the summer," Blossom said.Setnetters say they lose between $20,000 and $30,000 each day they aren't allowed to fish."A setnet operation is much like a farm," Blossom said. "We harvest the crop when the crop's ready, but the rest of the year we work on equipment and boats and getting everything ready, so it's pretty much a year-round operation."The Kenai King Salmon Alliance was granted intervention status by the court on Monday, meaning it will be allowed to advocate for the state.Sherman Ernouf, an attorney for the Kenai King Conservation Alliance, says the setnetters take too many kings in their efforts to harvest sockeyes. His group wants to put a halt on all harvesting of king salmon until numbers come back up."The setnetters want to fish more at a time when they're killing too many kings, so it's important for us that the judge rule in favor of the state because we believe the state did the right thing in shutting down the fishing," Ernouf said.No decision about whether Fish and Game accurately followed its management plans was reached on Tuesday, but the hearing will continue on Wednesday and both sides will provide a final summation on why the court should rule in their favor.Contact Samantha AngaiakCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

At the top of the agenda is possible policy changes in management of Kenai king salmon.<COL>Kenai Kings Focus of Alaska Board MeetingOn Friday the Alaska Board of Fisheries will meet for two weeks to discuss the Upper Cook Inlet fishing, and at the top of the agenda will be Kenai Kings.Many fishermen feel it's time for a rule change when it comes to the management of the king salmon runs in Alaska. The board will discuss possible policy changes in management of Kenai king salmon, what Kenai River Sportfishing Association's Ricky Gease says is the top issue for the board."How do you best manage fisheries in this record time of low abundance for the commercial fisheries, the sports fisheries and the personal use fisheries?" Gease asked.Fisheries experts say it’s a billion-dollar question. For many fishing groups involved, they say the answer needs to include fairness."What we're seeking is to have paired prescriptive step downs in both fisheries," Gease said.He thinks both the in-river and setnet fisheries need to share the burden  for any in-season restrictions."The issue with the setnet fishery is that currently it's an on off switch," Gease said. "Either the full fleet is fishing, or they're not."Gease thinks once the restrictions require the in-river fishery to remove bait or change to catch and release, the setnet fishery should lose a net or two. But changing fishery regulations isn't always easy. Tracy Lingnau, a biologist for the Department of Fish and Game, says one of the main problems is sockeye fishermen accidentally netting kings."We're trying to harvest sockeye, and the best thing we can do is try to minimize the harvest of king salmon while harvesting the surplus of the sockeye salmon," Lingnau said.Lingnau said the commercial fishermen went to a new strategy this past year one where they only fished during the surplus of sockeye salmon. He thinks this was successful in preventing the incidental catch of kings, but it will be up to the board to decide if those management efforts are the solution.The Alaska Board of Fisheries will meet from Jan. 31 to Feb. 13 at the Egan Center.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

In all, 202 fish were hooked by anglers fishing on 270 boats.Jim Lavrakas, the executive director of the Homer Chamber of Commerce, said this year was “the second best tournament in its 21 years.”The grand-champion angler this year was Kenai fisherman Reymond Tepp with his 30.6 lb king. In addition to his $19,026 payout, Tepp also won a cranberry vest as the tournament champion, awarded in a brief ceremony Saturday. Lavrakas said he hopes the vest will become a traditional part of the tournament.Second place went to Eric Kjelland of Eagle River, who took silver with his 25.9 lb fish, who took home $13,684. But Kjelland took home even more in side bets—essentially bets against other boats over who would catch the biggest fish—with more than $7,200 in winnings at the $125 tier and more than $11,300 in winnings at the $100 tier.Third place was awarded to another Kenai fisherman, Jon Bartelds, who nabbed a 25.7 chinook and took home $9,966.The “feeder kings” are king salmon found in Kachemak Bay throughout the winter, Lavrakas said.“These kings are here all year. They’re not ready to spawn. There here to feed, to get fat.”The kings are living in the salt water of the bay, bulking up the shrimp and needlefish abundant in the bay due to how the contours of the underwater waterways funnel food to area.Last year’s first-place fish, a 35.1 lb king caught by Leszek Kuligowski netted the Anchorage fisherman $15,372 in winnings.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Luckily for us, that trip was granted.<COL>After last season’s ocean-floor obliteration, round 2 with Crazy Ray’s Adventures sits high on this year’s wish list. Luckily for us, that trip was granted.Just south of Anchorage, sitting in the port of Whittier, is a boat and captain possessed by excitement -- enough to be called crazy.For Crazy Ray’s Adventures captain Raymond Nix and his crew of fish seekers, fast action is the air they breathe. We motor out with Nix and company, hoping for the season’s first catch as he outlines the day’s plan.“We’re gonna head out to the Gulf waters of Alaska, in search of nice premium eating halibut,” Nix said. “After we get a nice limit of halibut, we're going to take off and go work on some rockfish that we've been pretty successful at getting. We've been getting about a seven-pound average, so pretty good-size fish, good-quality fish.”The thing about premium halibut, though, is that their fight is as good as their flavor.“It’s like 100 feet deep -- you still got this,” Nix said as I reeled in a particularly ornery specimen.“We’ve got color,” Nix said.“Are you lying?” I asked the crew.“No, we see her!” came the reply.All that work pays off with me reeling in my first halibut of the year -- although my back is cramped after battling the fish into the boat. On this summer day, though, the fish forecast is calling for a scorcher.“Fish on, all the way around the boat!” Nix yelled to my fellow anglers. “That's how it's done.”Nix gives us the luxury of being picky, because we know the big guys are just waiting their turn.“We’ll be nice and let ya go,” Nix said to a small halibut, as we dropped it back into the water.Once our halibut limit is down, we set out for black bass; 20 minutes later, we've got a full boat.With big bites and fast fish, these guys aren't just called crazy -- they're the reason for the term.Hot spots this week include Whittier’s windfall of halibut and rockfish, although everyone recommends dropping a shrimp pot there as well.While you can hit up Homer for the flatfish as well, there are some hit-or-miss options such as Kasilof fishing reportedly improving for kings.In addition, the Slammin’ Salmon Derby starts Friday for kings in Ship Creek.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Accidentally got on a plane.Thanksgiving travelers spent the day Tuesday catching flights in Anchorage and Honolulu to destinations as remote as the Alaska village of Pitkas Point and as far away as Saipan.Some were cashing in on holiday deals on hotel rooms in Las Vegas or in the case of one Anchorage family, escaping to golf courses in Hawaii.Here's a sampling of travel tales from the largest airports in Alaska and Hawaii:Ruth Riley was sitting at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, waiting for her flight home to the tiny western Alaska village of Pitkas Point, a Yup'ik Eskimo community of about 100 people. She had been attending a meeting of shareholders of Calista Corp., the Alaska Native corporation for her region.For Thanksgiving, she and her husband are splurging on a turkey in the village, where a 10-pound bird runs in the $40 range. They will also enjoy traditional Native foods such as dried chum salmon strips and her version of akutaq, or Eskimo ice cream, with her ingredients including a concoction of shortening mixed with sugar, berries and mild whitefish.A family reunion with her daughters will have to wait until Christmas, when she and her husband go to the hub town of Bethel 100 miles to the south."Since my husband is a dog musher," she said. "He didn't want to leave his dogs."...Larson and Alice Hunter and their two young children were in Anchorage, heading home to the Yup'ik village of Scammon Bay on Alaska's western coast.Larson, the city manager of the village, had been in Anchorage on business and his wife and children came along as a vacation treat. His work paid for his trip and he had enough airline points for the family because he travels a lot.In Scammon Bay, the family will have two Thanksgiving feasts — first with Alice's parents then with Larson's mother. Along with turkey and the usual fixings, they will have akutaq. Larson's mother also will prepare some other Native food, but they won't know what until Thursday."Moose is typical," Larson said."If we're lucky, snow goose," Alice said....Dennis Kline picked up his son Isaiah from the airport after the 14-year-old flew home from the southeast Alaska town of Sitka, where he attends Mount Edgecumbe boarding school. Kline, his wife and two children would return to the airport later for the flight to Hawaii, where they planned to hit the golf links.To keep down the high cost of traveling, Kline, a retired Army colonel, and his wife plan ahead. They are both retired and can afford the luxury of fitting their schedules to the best flight deals while avoiding travel crunch days."The holiday rush in winter season seems to be a real tough time to travel," Kline said. "There's a lot of sometimes delays and weather and things."...Lexi Cherry and her father, Bryan, were sharing a cinnamon roll at the airport after her flight from Juneau, where she is a history major at the University of Alaska Southeast.She had split the cost of the flight with her parents, who live in the Wasilla area north of Anchorage. Cherry said it's her first Thanksgiving back home in a few years, and she's looking forward to her mom's whipped sweet potatoes and getting lots of sleep."Wait until you see the list of chores we have for you," her father said....Alfreda Camacho was hoping to get home to Saipan in time for Thanksgiving. She had attended a conference in American Samoa then visited family in Honolulu and was rearranging a suitcase to make room for Christmas presents she was taking home."I feel that it's going to be a really full flight and ... I got here about an hour and a half early than check-in time," she said about her flight from Honolulu International Airport to Japan. After a layover, she would catch another flight to Saipan....Joel Akins and his girlfriend Alex Tingat were at the airport on a layover from Brisbane, Australia. They opted for a Las Vegas vacation because they found deals on accommodations during Thanksgiving. After flying to Los Angeles, they planned to take a bus to Vegas."We figure no one wants to go to Vegas on Thanksgiving," said Tingat.Hotel prices were cheaper, but flights were more expensive, Akins said, adding that he was bracing for travel to be more hectic once they got to Los Angeles....Justin Hornsby was seeing his wife, Mayumi Hornsby, off at the Honolulu International Airport. She was traveling to Japan to spend the holidays with her family. "I'm surprised it's not more crowded," he said after arriving several hours before her flight....Kelleher reported from Honolulu, and D'Oro reported from Anchorage, Alaska.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Click on to see if you're guilty.<COL>iStock/dra_schwartzThere are just some crimes that are unforgivable. The kind of crimes so heinous that they make your skin crawl or cause you to question the existence of God.Like murder or casting Paris Hilton as a nuclear physicist or ... using your Facebook status to record the boring minute-by-minute minutia of your day.Seriously, you had corn flakes for breakfast? Nice. You clipped your toenails while watching "The View"? Good to know. You're en route to the grocery store to buy some milk and eggs? Try to locate some self-restraint while you're at it.Of course, like in every good crime story, everybody's a suspect. We all do this stuff and usually it starts out small. One minute you're taking a quiz to see which "Jersey Shore" character you are, the next you're posting drunken party photos for all the world to see that outdo even the most publicity-starved reality TV star.Some would rank such social networking behavior as mere pet peeves or minor annoyances, but it's time to make some more serious charges stick. To us, these are nothing less than "Facebook Felonies."Do you respect the English language?No. 5: Malicious Destruction of the English LanguageIt's definitely a crime against the English language, but the shorthand used in texting, often called "textese," is also a capital offense on Facebook.It might be understandable if you're posting from your iPhone, but with a full keyboard in front of you, what's the defense for typing "What ru up 2? b/c I wz 1dering if u wanted to do sumthing 2nite? Every1 is going out. c ya l8tr."It might have been charming for a bit when Prince tried that stuff in the '80s, but it's just plain lazy. As if it wasn't hard enough figuring out whether you want the "live" or the "news" feed, nobody wants their Facebook wall to look like an eye chart.After all, how much time can really be saved by typing "u" instead of the two additional letters necessary for "you"?Are you guilty of entrapment?No. 4: First-Degree EntrapmentSo that cryptic, puzzling message you just posted as your latest status update? It wouldn't hold up in a court of law and it's not fooling anyone ... OK, so maybe more than a few Facebook victims took the bait.But the rest of us see right through your nefarious plan. You're not being an endearing enigma wrapped up in a ball of cuteness. What you're really doing is seeking attention, or as we call it, trolling.Examples of this crime include posting updates along the lines of "John can't believe what just happened" or "Stacey wishes some people would just grow up." Or, even worse, something truly bizarre like "Josh has had it up to here with all these darn chickens."Not even a trained professional could run such a convincing con. Like a fish attracted to something shiny, Facebook friends gobble up the lure in one gulp, not even knowing they're swallowing the hook at the same time.Do you know the line between sharing and oversharing?No. 3: Public IndecencyGo ahead. Call this crime by its oh-so-annoying abbreviation TMI and see how quickly the Internet acronym police slap some matching steel bracelets on you and toss you in the back of a black and white.Between proud mothers sharing every tiny detail of their toddlers' potty training routine and people who post in great detail about every single health complaint they have, it's time to issue an APB on society's ability to self-censor.If you've ever been an eyeball witness to one of your parents filling you, and anyone else visiting their Facebook page for that matter, in on the more intimate parts of his or her life, than you've been a victim of oversharing.No email address was supplied by.

Here are some tips to conserve fuel while on the water:- Find the Sweet Spot. Every boat has a "sweet spot," the speed at which the engine and hull perform most efficiently. If your engine comes with a fuel-management system you can find your sweet spot by running your boat at different cruising speeds. Write down the speed and the fuel consumption in gallons per hour for each level. Then use this equation to establish the miles per gallon for comparison: mph/gph = mpg. Once you establish the engine RPM that delivers the highest mpg, that's the speed at which you want to run your boat.- Adjust Your Fishing Habits. Not all fishing requires long runs to the fishing grounds and a constantly running engine. Try switching over to drift fishing or anchoring up on structure areas to bottom fish. Freshwater anglers can get more fishing time with less fuel by using an electric trolling motor in addition to their gas engine. Changing the way you fish can keep you fishing longer for less.- Find Fuel-Efficient Engines. Today's modern four-stroke and high-pressure, direct-injection, two-stroke outboard motors are the most fuel-efficient marine engines ever made. The typical fuel savings over an old carbureted engine can be 25 to 40 percent. If you're still running an older outboard, buying a new one could help offset your expenses.Discuss your engine with a local dealer and see whether you are a candidate for a new outboard.- Have a Plan. Knowing where you want to fish will save travel time and money and can help you catch more fish. Plan out the places you want to try in logical order to reduce running time, and eliminate backtracking to reduce fuel use.No email address was supplied by.

So what should you do if your business is targeted by a patent troll?<COL>It's every small business owner's worst nightmare: getting a letter from a lawyer alleging that your business is infringing on someone else's patent. Even worse, the patent you're accused of infringing sounds like a farce. How, you ask yourself, could someone possibly have a patent for that? So you call a lawyer and they tell you, yes, that patent is legitimate and you might have to pay a licensing fee for continuing to do some basic business process, likescanning and emailing documents. This situation is referred to aspatent trolling.Patent trolls are companies, often run by lawyers, that amass large portfolios of often-spotty patents and enforce those patents for financial gain by targeting any business that may by infringing on those patents, whether intentionally or not.What happens if your business is targeted by a patent troll?THELAW.TVasked that question to patent attorneyCorey Donaldsonof the Westlake Village, Calif., firm Koppel, Patrick, Heybl & Philpott. Mr. Donaldson is a USPTO registered patent attorney. Here are his suggestions:1) Be prepared to spend some money upfront in order to avoid potentially large losses later. In the rare case where a business is already aware that they may potentially infringe a patent, it may be worthwhile to seek a legal opinion on the matter. Initially, a law firm should be able to do an infringement search if you are unaware of patents you may be infringing. Some firms will use a third party contractor specifically specializing in such searches to keep costs down, and then perform the legal analysis on the search results. Alternatively, you may already have a specific patent in mind, which would save costs. If the initial post-analysis legal opinion is infringement, you may want to consider designing around the patent in question. If the initial opinion is non-infringement, you may want to ask the attorney to prepare a formal non-infringement report, which can later be used in court. Even if you are found to be infringing, such an opinion can help to limit the amount of damages.2) In most cases, a business isn't aware of potential infringement until it receives a cease and desist letter from a PAE (patent assertion entity) or its attorney. Part of spending money upfront to avoid big losses later includes seeking the advice of a patent attorney at this point, as opposed to looking at what the patents cover and saying something to the effect of "there's no way I'm infringing that, it has nothing to do with my product." Patents and patent claims have a language of their own, and are usually very difficult to understand -- even for an expert in the relevant technological field. It can therefore be very difficult for a non-attorney to perform an accurate infringement analysis.3) If the accusing party is vague in its accusations, request that they specify exactly what rights it is that your company is allegedly infringing. The best starting point is to request that they point out specific patent and claim numbers that they believe your company is infringing. You can also request that they provide an analysis of why your product infringes each claim, although the PAE may refuse to give this until a later stage.4) After analyzing the PAE's accusations (or, preferably, after a patent attorney analyzes the accusations), do a cost/benefit analysis of your options. One option, if you believe that the PAE's claim is baseless, is to state your case in a letter and "call their bluff," which may cause the PAE to cease their efforts. However, if you believe that the PAE may have a legitimate case, some other non-litigation options include:- Challenge the patent's validity. Many times when a patent claim is overly broad, the claim can potentially be invalidated without going through the full litigation process. Under the recently-implemented America Invents Act, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has three proceedings that are substantially cheaper and less involved than full-blown litigation: Post-Grant Review (for patents issued within the past nine months), Ex Parte Reexamination, and Inter Partes Review. I'd be more than willing to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these if you would like to get into details.- Alter your product such that it does not infringe. Patent claims are often narrowly written such that a minor change in manufacturing or product structure will avoid infringement.- Negotiate a licensing agreement. Even if you have a good faith belief that your product does not infringe, but realize that the PAE has a legitimate argument, this can sometimes be the best option to avoid litigation and keep costs down.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But those now familiar man-made noises are almost a century in the making. Government Hill, the neighborhood there, is almost as old.BeforePresident Woodrow Wilson's administration made Anchorage the connecting hub for a stretch of railroad, the most prominent dot on western maps of the Alaska Territory was Campbell Point. In 1915, construction of a railroad that eventually would link Seward and Whittier to the coal-rich fields of the Matanuska Valley and the state's expansive interior began.Hoards of job seekers arrived on boats and set up tents on the flats, and so burgeoned a tent city. One could stay alive there, but there was not exactly a high quality of life. To attract and keep people working in the newly-founded Anchorage, the Alaska Railroad, backed by the federal government, decided to build cottages on the hill.Anchorage, which draws its name because boats decided to drop anchor here, has a name about as original as Government Hill, which would not exist in its current form if not for the government throwing cash at the hill nearest the tent city.That's the story as told by historian Bruce Merrell, who spent much of his career with the Anchorage Public Library System.According to Merrell, the importance of the railroad to the city's growth could not be overstated."If you look at the earliest phone directories for Anchorage, perhaps a quarter or even a third of the people who lived in Anchorage worked for the railroad," he said.So when construction ended in 1923, things puttered along until the threat of a land invasion by Imperial Japan became apparent. The military ramped up investment in the area, including the construction of Elmendorf Army Air Base, which gave Government Hill its modern borders.That's about the time Weaver Franklin arrived. In 1946, the western Nebraska native bought a lot on Government Hill."I was out in the Aleutian Islands for quite a while," the 90-year-old historian said, standing outside his home, wearing his Alaska Railroad cap.“I passed through Anchorage and liked what I seen. That was a long string of bars. It was a good place for a young fellow to have fun, and so I came back," Merrell said.In the early days, he lived in a Quonset hut, a simple steel building sold off as surplus by the military. Similar structures lined Harvard Avenue and the streets nearby.Even when he got too old for the bars, he stayed around and raised a family. He worked on the railroad for the better part of four decades, eventually becoming a locomotive engineer, then to management of the operations. All the while he remained in the neighborhood."It was fun; it was a great adventure," Merrell said.Virginia Borrego, standing along the fence that separates her yard fromFranklin's, waved a picture of the steel abode she once called home."They were all like this," Borrego said. "And they were nice."Whenever there are talks of the neighborhood's history, invariably they shift to the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake. On Government Hill, the elementary school split down the middle; half of the building dropped 20 feet, and the playground fell 35 feet.According to a report, the problem was that gravel had been pulled from the foot of the hill during railroad expansions. Because school was out, no one was hurt. No one on Government Hill died."How lucky we were that the kids weren’t in that school," Franklin said. "It would've killed half of them.""Everything was just like it was, it just sank," said Borrego, who was a teacher at the school. She remembers leaving her shoes in the building earlier that day and going back to get them from her classroom.Even today, where the school was once located, now the site ofSunset Park, there is still rusted rebar and gravelly concrete jutting out of the ground where the school was once located. A new school was built a few blocks away, back from the bluff, right next to the base.Another topic that often comes up is the neighborhood's future. A potential bridge across the Knik Arm may someday end up in Government Hill; cuts to the military budget and ongoing talks of base consolidation could affect the people who live there. But the place has changed before. Long before trains and soldiers and bridges showed up, the salmon-rich creeks below were fished and the hills above camped."Every time I think about doing something, I look at this and think forget it," Borrego said to her longtime neighbor.No email address was supplied by.

It may seem counter-intuitive that Islamist militants s...<COL>Gary Cameron/ReutersThe devastating attack on the Grand Mosque in Kano, Nigeria, Friday was almost certainly the work of Boko Haram, which has stepped up its bombing campaign across northern Nigeria in recent weeks.It may seem counter-intuitive that Islamist militants should attack a mosque, but since its early days Boko Haram has targeted the Muslim "establishment" in Nigeria, accusing it of not defending the interests of Nigeria's 80 million Muslims, of corruption and of "perverting" Islam.One eminent member of that establishment is the emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, a former governor of Nigeria's Central Bank who frequently preaches at the Kano mosque on Fridays. The emir of Kano is the second-most influential Muslim figure in Nigeria.Sanusi was reportedly out of the country at the time of Friday's attack -- but two weeks ago he used Friday prayers to urge Nigerians to defend themselves against Boko Haram."People must stand resolute" against a group that enslaves girls and "must not assume that the crisis will not reach their area," Sanusi said.The Kano attack, which killed dozens of worshipers and injured scores more, is not the first aimed at a mosque, nor at an emir. Last year, at least 40 worshippers were shot dead at a mosque in Borno state, where Boko Haram is strongest. The group has also assassinated senior Muslim political and religious figures in northern Nigeria. And it has specifically targeted anyone calling for or organizing self-defense units, known as the Civilian Joint Task Force.Sanusi's predecessor, Emir Al Haji Ado Bayero, was the target of an assassination attempt in February 2013. His driver and bodyguards were killed. Bayero died at the age of 83 earlier this year.Boko Haram has stepped up suicide bombings, causing mass casualties in several northern states. Just this week, two female suicide bombers attacked a busy market in the city of Maiduguri, killing twenty-one people. And the bombing of a bus station near Mubi in Ademawa state killed some forty people.Boko Haram claimed to have taken control of Mubi, a town of 200,000 people, at the end of October -- a sign of its commitment to build an area in northern Nigeria ruled by Islamic law -- in addition to carrying out terror attacks. The Nigerian army -- supported by civilian vigilantes -- was able to expel Boko Haram from Mubi two weeks later, but the group still controls several towns across northeastern Nigeria, including Gwoza -- a town of nearly 300,000 in Borno state.According to Boko Haram's mysterious leader, Abubakar Shekau, Gwoza was evidence of the group's growing ambitions in northern Nigeria. "Thanks be to Allah, who gave victory to our brethren in Gwoza and made it a state among Islamic states," he said in August.Virginia Comolli, research fellow for security and development at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN that the Nigerian military faces multiple problems. It has been plagued by indiscipline, desertion and mutinies, with some commanders attacked by their own men. It has developed a well-documented reputation for human rights abuses -- alienating many of the people it is meant to protect.Additionally, a lack of support has left many units exposed in the vast rural hinterland of the north, where Boko Haram has shown it can operate simultaneously on several fronts. Last week, for example, its fighters ambushed and killed nearly 50 fish-sellers close to Lake Chad, nearly 400 miles from Kano, despite the nearby presence of a multinational border force.A state of emergency in parts of northern Nigeria has had little impact on Boko Haram, and despite intense international attention the Nigerian military has been unable to rescue any of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped earlier this year.The group's resumption of a campaign of suicide bombings is likely aimed at humiliating the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who recently declared he would run for re-election in February next year. Besides its ideological aversion to democracy, which it sees as inimical to Islam, Boko Haram despises Jonathan as a southern Christian and wants to make the north ungovernable. Comolli says one of its aims is to ensure February's election cannot be held in the three northern states where emergencies have been declared. Attacking Kano, the biggest city in the north and a trade hub, is part of that strategy. (The state of Kano is one of the two most populous in Nigeria.)In an effort to win more international support, Nigerian officials have likened Boko Haram to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Nigeria's ambassador in Washington, Adebowale Ibidapo Adefuye, said earlier this month: "There is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to deliver light jabs to the terrorists when what we need to give them is the killer punch."Dismissing claims that the army was responsible for human rights abuses as rumor and hearsay, Adeyufe said the United States needed to do more to help a partner in the battle against terrorism."We find it difficult to understand how and why, in spite of the U.S. presence in Nigeria with their sophisticated military technology, Boko Haram should be expanding and becoming more deadly,'' he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations.Despite providing technical assistance in the hunt for the missing schoolgirls, the Obama administration appears wary of engagement with a military that has such a flawed reputation.There is evidence that Boko Haram has links with other jihadist groups. Some of its fighters spent time in Mali alongside a faction of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in early 2012, when much of that country fell under AQIM's sway for several months. Its rapid assimilation of bomb-making expertise and the use of kidnapping for ransom also suggests contacts with AQIM, says Comolli. But she believes that as AQIM has come under pressure following the French intervention in Mali, it has become less able to provide training or other help to Boko Haram.For now, Boko Haram remains a very much Nigerian phenomenon focused on causing mayhem at home.

The tighter rules provoked widespread anger in rural Alaska, with some residents choosing to fish in violation of them; two dozen have been tried for misdemeanor charges, with two fishermen convicted and fined $250 in October.Tom Vania, Fish and Game’s regional fisheries management coordinator for Cook Inlet, says the new restrictions this year shouldn’t surprise people, noting that only four of 17 Cook Inlet-area streams met their state escapement goals in 2012.“Again, these are a lot of actions we took last year,” Vania said. “I think people are prepared to do what it takes to achieve escapement goals -- there's a lot of people that are concerned about the resources as well.”Vania says that while Thursday’s restrictions will reduce anglers’ take of Chinooks, there are other species in abundance, such as coho or sockeye salmon and lake trout. Fish and Game recently unveiled a Google Earth application that shows lakes stocked with fish by state officials.“There's a lot of opportunity out there for people to still wet a line, still put food in the freezer,” Vania said. “Sockeye should be looking real good this summer; last year there was a lot of chum salmon that made it up to Cook Inlet.”Several of Thursday’s orders, which will generally be in effect May 1 through June 30, target the Anchor and Ninilchik rivers as well as Deep Creek. On those waterways, anglers will only be allowed to use one single-hook, unbaited artificial lure, and will have to end the day’s fishing for any species after harvesting a king salmon 20 inches or longer.Those three bodies of water, as well as Cook Inlet’s marine waters between the latitudes of the Ninilchik River’s mouth and Bluff Point, will fall under a combined annual limit of two kings 20 inches or longer.In orders affecting specific area rivers, Fish and Game will close the Anchor River to sport fishing on Wednesdays, shortening the area open to fishing by moving a regulatory marker about 1,000 feet downstream of the junction for the river’s north and south forks. The Ninilchik River will have a bag and possession limit of one natural or hatchery-produced king through June 30. The limit will then become one hatchery-produced king effective July 1.“A naturally-produced king salmon is a king salmon with an adipose fin intact,” Fish and Game officials wrote. “Hatchery-produced king salmon are distinguished from naturally-produced king salmon by a healed adipose fin-clip scar. The adipose fin is the small fleshy fin on the back just ahead of the tail.”The Kasilof River will see its bag and possession limits fall to one hatchery-produced king salmon from May 1 through June 30. According to Fish and Game, naturally produced kings may not be taken or removed from the water.Units 1 through 6 of the Susitna River drainage, as well as the Little Susitna River, will see a separate set of restrictions taking effect May 15, including an annual limit of two kings 20 inches or longer. An annual limit on Chinooks of that size taken from fresh waters of Cook Inlet remains at five, but no more than two may be taken from the Susitna and the Little Su.“King salmon recorded before Wednesday, May 15, on the harvest portion of an Alaska sport fishing license or harvest record card do not count against the two king salmon that may be harvested beginning May 15, but do count against the Cook Inlet annual limit of five king salmon,” Fish and Game officials wrote.The Susitna and Little Su, as well as the Deshka River, will also be restricted to single-hook, artificial unbaited lures. In the Susitna River and Knik Arm drainages, harvesting a king 20 inches or longer will end the day’s fishing for all species, while the harvest of Little Su kings of any size will only be allowed Saturday through Monday -- with catch-and-release fishing permitted Tuesday through Friday.Harvesting of fish will be allowed on the Deshka seven days a week. In the Yentna River drainage, except for the Talachulitna River, harvesting will only be permitted Friday through Monday, with catch-and-release fishing Tuesday through Thursday.Kings may not be harvested in any area of the Susitna River drainage’s Unit 1 except the Deshka. The ban also applies to Unit 2’s Parks Highway streams, in addition to the Upper Susitna, Talachulitna, Talkeetna and Chulitna rivers.“Catch-and-release fishing will be allowed during days and times normally open to king salmon fishing within these management units,” Fish and Game officials wrote.According to Fish and Game, the Eklutna Tailrace is excluded from all restrictions.Channel 2’s Steve Mac Donald contributed information to this story.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

The House and Senate need to p...<COL>CNNCongressional Republicans are vowing to fight President Barack Obama's plan to change immigration laws through executive action, but they are struggling with how to do that without triggering another government shutdown.The House and Senate need to pass a measure during the lame duck session to fund federal agencies, which will run out of money in mid-December. House conservatives are pressing Speaker John Boehner to attach language to the spending bill that would block any money for federal agencies to give out any new visas or green cards.But House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, who is crafting a yearlong so-called "omnibus" spending measure, warned that effort could trigger a shutdown, and insisted no one wants to go down that road."There's no one stronger than me against unilateral action by the President on this subject, however it's been said before - don't take a hostage you can't shoot," Rogers told reporters after a meeting with all House Republicans on Thursday.The debate over how to confront Obama is posing a sudden challenge for Republican leaders fresh off their victories during last week's midterm elections, which gave them control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade. A day after the election, Mitch McConnell, who will become Senate majority leader in January, said Republicans would take positions Obama wouldn't like but pledged not to shut down the government.Obama, who is traveling in Asia this week, has said he remains committed to using his executive authority to address immigration by the end of the year but the precise timing isn't clear. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in Myanmar that Obama is "nearing a final decision."Boehner told members at Thursday meeting that one of his top priorities is to use every tool available to him to stop any effort by the president to go around Congress on immigration, according to several Republicans who attended. But the Speaker also said he doesn't want a shutdown, and he cautioned members that they need to game out a smart way to respond before they move forward with a vote.At an afternoon press conference, Boehner pledged to "fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path."He said no decisions were made and GOP leaders were considering various ways to block the action, but did not rule out waging the fight on the spending bill."All options are on the table," he said.Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, who drafted a letter signed by more than 50 House GOP members to Rogers, told reporters he's not pushing for a shutdown, but leaders shouldn't rule out any options."It's really tragic that before we even fight a fight, or even stake a claim that we're throwing in the towel. I just don't think that's the way to operate. We don't have to talk about ultimatum scenarios at this point in time," Salmon told reporters after the meeting.Salmon argued that after the midterm elections Republicans have a mandate to push back at the president, and they should use their legislative authority to curb his executive actions.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid supports Obama's effort to address immigration but has privately conveyed concerns to the White House that an executive action could threaten passage of the spending bill."The President has said he'll do the executive action, the question is when," Reid told CNN in a hallway interview in the Capitol. "He can do it, you know, it's up to him. But I'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it's up to him."Several Republicans told CNN the memory of last year's shutdown and the damage it inflicted on the GOP brand is fresh enough that members are willing to give the Speaker some time to decide what approach to take. A vote on a spending bill is not expected on the House floor until early December.What's complicating the next move for Boehner and other congressional Republican leaders is no one knows the details yet on the timing or scope of what the President will do.Even if House Republicans have the votes to pass something as part of a spending bill, any measure that blocks the president from using his own authority will be blocked in the Senate, which is still controlled by Democrats, or vetoed by the president. That leaves the clock ticking before the government runs out of money on December 11th.One option GOP leaders are considering is passing a short term spending bill -one lasting a few weeks even - that would avoid a shutdown and give them more time to decide how to respond to the President after he rolls out his plan, which is expected by the end of the year.Another is to expand the lawsuit against President Obama that House Republicans already approved to challenge his authority to implement Obamacare. Although the House voted to sue the president in July, the formal legal paperwork hasn't been filed with the courts yet.Whether leaders decide to challenge the president as part of a spending bill or later, it's clear that conservatives are bracing for a major confrontation with the president over his plans to allow potentially millions of undocumented workers to remain in the U.S."I trust him completely to do the worst left wing, twisted policy that he can come up with" Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks told CNN.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.No email address was supplied by.

City janitors delivered the birds door-to-door, she said.Whalers didn’t land any bowheads in Savoonga this fall, Toolie said. “It’s been pretty windy, it’s been raining.” Many families will likely add a variety of salmon berryakutaqor reindeer to their turkey plates.The food cost $15,609.66, not counting shipping costs. All told, 275 turkeys and 275 pies arrived at the village over two days, the council member said.About720 people live in the St. Lawrence Island Yupik village,680 miles from Anchorage but only about 75 miles across the Bering Strait from the shores of Russia’s Chukotka Peninsula. City turkey donations have become a tradition in recent years, Toolie said.In the 1950s and 1960s, residents used to gather for a large holiday feast on the island, she said. More recently, as freight costs rose, the city began purchasing the food and volunteers cooked it and served meals at a community event.In the past two or three years, Toolie said, the practice shifted to simply providing every household a frozen turkey and other Thanksgiving Day staples.“We usually have our janitors deliver (the turkeys),” Toolie said. “We give them a list.”Employees at the village store said the turkeys were delivered within the past week. The city used proceeds from charitable gaming to help cover the cost and will likely donate leftover birds to the school, Toolie said.Find KTUU digital director Kyle Hopkins attwitter.com/khopkinsakor email khopkins@ktuu.com.No email address was supplied by.

In fact, a diabetes diet is the best eating plan for most everyone.If you have diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will likely recommend that you see a dietitian to guide you on dietary changes and MNT that can help you control your blood sugar (glucose) level and manage your weight.When you eat excess calories and fat, your body responds by creating an undesirable rise in blood glucose. If blood glucose isn't kept in check, it can lead to serious problems, such as a dangerously high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) and chronic complications, such as nerve, kidney and heart damage.Making healthy food choices and tracking your eating habits can help you manage your blood glucose level and keep it within a safe range.For most people with type 2 diabetes, weight loss also can make it easier to control blood glucose and offers a host of other health benefits. If you need to lose weight, MNT provides a well-organized, nutritious way to reach your goal safely.A registered dietitian can help you put together a diet based on your health goals, tastes and lifestyle and can provide valuable information on how to change your eating habits.Recommended foodsMake your calories count with these nutritious foods:Foods to avoidDiabetes increases your risk of heart disease and stroke by accelerating the development of clogged and hardened arteries. Foods containing the following can work against your goal of a heart-healthy diet.Putting it all together: Creating a planThere are a few different approaches to creating a diabetes diet that keeps your blood glucose level within a normal range. With a dietitian's help, you may find one or a combination of methods that works for you.Counting carbohydrates.Because carbohydrates break down into glucose, they have the greatest impact on your blood glucose level. It's important to make sure your timing and amount of carbohydrates are the same each day, especially if you take diabetes medications or insulin. Otherwise, your blood glucose level may fluctuate more.A dietitian can teach you how to measure food portions and become an educated reader of food labels, paying special attention to serving size and carbohydrate content. If you're taking insulin, he or she can teach you how to count the amount of carbohydrates in each meal or snack and adjust your insulin dose accordingly.The exchange system.A dietitian may recommend using the exchange system, which groups foods into categories such as carbohydrates, meats and meat substitutes, and fats.One serving in a group is called an "exchange." An exchange has about the same amount of carbohydrates, protein, fat and calories -- and the same effect on your blood glucose -- as a serving of every other food in that same group. So, for example, you could exchange -- or trade -- one small apple for 1/3 cup of cooked pasta, for one carbohydrate serving.A sample menuYour daily meal plan should take into account your size as well as your physical activity level. The following menu is tailored for someone who needs 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day.Embracing your healthy-eating plan is the best way to keep your blood glucose level under control and prevent diabetes complications. And if you need to lose weight, you can tailor it to your specific goals.Aside from managing your diabetes, a diabetes diet offers other benefits, too. Because a diabetes diet recommends generous amounts of fruits, vegetables and fiber, following it is likely to reduce your risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. And consuming low-fat dairy products can reduce your risk of low bone mass in the future.If you have diabetes, it's important that you partner with your doctor and dietitian to create an eating plan that works for you. Healthy foods, portion control and scheduling are necessary to manage your blood glucose level. If you stray from your prescribed diet, you run the risk of fluctuating blood sugar levels and more-serious complications.Source: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-diet/DA00027Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The Mediterranean diet incorporates the basics of healthy eating — plus a splash of flavorful olive oil and perhaps even a glass of red wine — among other components characterizing the traditional cooking style of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.Most healthy diets include fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains, and limit unhealthy fats. While these parts of a healthy diet remain tried-and-true, subtle variations or differences in proportions of certain foods may make a difference in your risk of heart disease.Research has shown that the traditional Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease. In fact, an analysis of more than 1.5 million healthy adults demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease and cancer, as well as a reduced incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends the Mediterranean diet as an eating plan that can help promote health and prevent disease. And the Mediterranean diet is one your whole family can follow for good health.The Mediterranean diet emphasizes:The diet also recognizes the importance of being physically active, and enjoying meals with family and friends.The Mediterranean diet traditionally includes fruits, vegetables and grains. For example, residents of Greece average six or more servings a day of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables.Grains in the Mediterranean region are typically whole grain and usually contain very few unhealthy trans fats, and bread is an important part of the diet. However, throughout the Mediterranean region, bread is eaten plain or dipped in olive oil — not eaten with butter or margarine, which contains saturated or trans fats.Nuts are another part of a healthy Mediterranean diet. Nuts are high in fat, but most of the fat is healthy. Because nuts are high in calories, they should not be eaten in large amounts — generally no more than a handful a day. For the best nutrition, avoid candied or honey-roasted and heavily salted nuts.The focus of the Mediterranean diet isn't on limiting total fat consumption, but rather on choosing healthier types of fat. The Mediterranean diet discourages saturated fats and hydrogenated oils (trans fats), both of which contribute to heart disease.The Mediterranean diet features olive oil as the primary source of fat. Olive oil is mainly monounsaturated fat — a type of fat that can help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when used in place of saturated or trans fats. "Extra-virgin" and "virgin" olive oils (the least processed forms) also contain the highest levels of protective plant compounds that provide antioxidant effects.Canola oil and some nuts contain the beneficial linolenic acid (a type of omega-3 fatty acid) in addition to healthy unsaturated fat. Omega-3 fatty acids lower triglycerides, decrease blood clotting, and are associated with decreased incidence of sudden heart attacks, improve the health of your blood vessels, and help moderate blood pressure. Fatty fish — such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon — are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Fish is eaten on a regular basis in the Mediterranean diet.The health effects of alcohol have been debated for many years, and some doctors are reluctant to encourage alcohol consumption because of the health consequences of excessive drinking. However, alcohol — in moderation — has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in some research studies.The Mediterranean diet typically includes a moderate amount of wine, usually red wine. This means no more than 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine daily for women of all ages and men older than age 65 and no more than 10 ounces (296 milliliters) of wine daily for younger men. More than this may increase the risk of health problems, including increased risk of certain types of cancer.If you're unable to limit your alcohol intake to the amounts defined above, if you have a personal or family history of alcohol abuse, or if you have heart or liver disease, refrain from drinking wine or any other alcohol.The Mediterranean diet is a delicious and healthy way to eat. Many people who switch to this style of eating say they'll never eat any other way. Here are some specific steps to get you started:No email address was supplied by.

Study results often conflict with each other and most studies aren't designed to definitively prove whether something prevents prostate cancer. As a result, no clear ways to prevent prostate cancer have emerged.In general, doctors recommend that men with an average risk of prostate cancer make choices that benefit their overall health if they're interested in prostate cancer prevention.There is some evidence that choosing a healthy diet that's low in fat and full of fruits and vegetables may contribute to a lower risk of prostate cancer, though this hasn't been proved concretely.If you want to reduce your risk of prostate cancer, consider trying to:Choose a low-fat diet.Foods that contain fats include meats, nuts, oils and dairy products, such as milk and cheese.In some studies, men who ate the highest amount of fat each day had an increased risk of prostate cancer. While this association doesn't prove that excess fat causes prostate cancer, reducing the amount of fat you eat each day has other proven benefits, such as helping you control your weight and helping your heart.To reduce the amount of fat you eat each day, limit fatty foods or choose low-fat varieties. For instance, reduce the amount of fat you add to foods when cooking, select leaner cuts of meat, and choose low-fat or reduced-fat dairy products.Eat more fat from plants than from animals.In studies that looked at fat consumption and prostate cancer risk, fats from animals were most likely to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Animal products that contain fats include meat, lard and butter.You might consider using plant-based fats instead of animal fats. For instance, cook with olive oil rather than butter. Sprinkle nuts or seeds on your salad rather than cheese.Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day.Fruits and vegetables are full of vitamins and nutrients that are thought to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, though research hasn't proved that any particular nutrient is guaranteed to reduce your risk.Eating more fruits and vegetables also tends to make you have less room for other foods, such as high-fat foods.You might consider increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day by adding an additional serving of a fruit or vegetable to each meal. Consider eating fruits and vegetables for snacks.Eat fish.Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna and herring — contain omega-3 fatty acids, a type of fatty acid that has been linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer. If you don't currently eat fish, you might consider adding it to your diet.Another way to add omega-3s to your diet is by eating flaxseed.Men who are obese — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — may have an increased risk of prostate cancer. If you are overweight or obese, work on losing weight. You can do this by reducing the number of calories you eat each day and increasing the amount of exercise you do.If you have a healthy weight, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week and choosing a healthy diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Studies of exercise and prostate cancer risk have mostly shown that men who exercise may have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.Exercise has many other health benefits and may reduce your risk of heart disease and other cancers. Exercise can help you maintain your weight, or it can help you lose weight.If you don't already exercise, make an appointment with your doctor to make sure it's OK for you to get started. When you begin exercising, go slowly. Add physical activity to your day by parking your car farther away from where you're going, and try taking the stairs instead of the elevator.Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.Some men have an increased risk of prostate cancer. For those with a very high risk of prostate cancer, there may be other options for risk reduction, such as medications. If you think you have a high risk of prostate cancer, discuss it with your doctor.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/in-depth/prostate-cancer-prevention/art-20045641/iStock/toranicoFind out how slow-growing prostate cancer is treated.iStock/moneybusinessimagesLearn different ways to cope with a new prostate cancer diagnosis here.iStock/artmannwitteFind out how hormone therapy can be used against prostate cancer.iStock/svanhornWhile there's no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, there are things you can do to reduce your risk.iStock / digitalskilletA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test can check men for the signs of prostate cancer.

But the two countries are now being linked by an unlikely dish: trout.Thanks to Highlands Trout, and their operation 2,200m above sea level in the Maluti Mountains, supermarket shoppers in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo can now get their seafood fix from the landlocked African nation."Lesotho provide(s) ideal, pristine environmental conditions for the farming of large trout," explains Fred Formanek, managing partner of Advance Africa Management Services, who has developed the Highlands Trout project since 2009. "Water temperatures are close to ideal [for trout] for most of the year due to the altitude."Production started in 2012 with a haul of 500 tonnes of trout in the first year. During the current financial year, the company aims to produce three-times that amount.While the business says the Japan-bound fish are stuck on a ship for four weeks, executives insist the added logistics -- and extra costs -- are worth it. "The price premium that we currently receive... makes up for any additional logistics costs," says Formanek.Business beginningsThe production process starts with the fish arriving in Lesotho from Denmark as eggs. They are then stored in temperature-controlled pens until they become "fingerlings" weighing around 10g. The baby fish are so fragile at this stage that the water quality is monitored regularly.Once they become fingerlings, the fish are transferred to small nursery cages in the Katse dam -- Africa's second largest. In these more natural conditions, the fish grow to around 20cm in length and a weight of around 150g.They are then moved to larger "grow cages" where they live their last days in the mountain kingdom. Through this whole process, which takes around 20 months, some of the fish grow as heavy as 2.8 kg -- lean fish meat fresh for sushi, soups and sizzling grills.And it's the vast majority of these fish -- 85% -- that will be gutted and loaded onto 40ft refrigerated containers and shipped from the South African port of Durban to Asia. The remainder is sold to South Africa (10%) and Lesotho (5%).Foreign inputsBut it's not just the fish that make a long journey to keep this business afloat.Using materials and expertise from abroad has been key to the success of the project. Specially designed cages have been imported from Norway (which is also where the farm manager was based for 20 years), while most of the protein rich pellets the fish nibble on whilst growing come from France.But not all aspects of this operation are imported. "We employ just over 100 [local people] on a permanent basis," explains managing director of Highlands Trout Grant Merrick. "The bulk of the employees are directly involved with the growing and processing of fish....We have many employees who have never been in formal employment prior to starting at Highlands Trout."This is an important consideration in a country where 24% of the population was unemployed in 2008 -- the last year records were collected. Government estimates from figures collected in 2010/11 show that 57% of the country lives in poverty.Future fishWhile this might be a significant operation now, the project has had to deal with difficulties to get to where it is today. "The extremely remote area, developing a high-tech business with the highest levels of food safety certification, in a country where aquaculture and fisheries did not exist, presented plenty of challenges," explains Formanek.And when the business is compared to the global market the impact is limited. Expert Peter Rand of the IUCN Salmon Specialist Group describes the production figures as "very small" compared to other sectors. He explains that salmon production in countries like Norway and Chile "is more than 1 million metric tons per year."But the Lesotho is showing no signs of shrinking in the face of the competition. "Projected growth is ramping up by some 750 tonnes per annum," explains Formanek. "Expansion into a second dam in the Highlands called Mohale Dam is in planning."While Highlands Trout may not swamp the supermarkets anytime soon, their use of Lesotho's natural resources and remote mountain landscape could help the operation see some success.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

The numbers pale in comparison to women's cases, with about 1,500 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed among men annually and 400 men dying each year compared to numbers of 92,370 and 40,170 for women.One of the biggest problems is that most men, even doctors, don't recognize the signs of male breast cancer, according to Men's Health magazine. Men are almost more likely to not understand the three major risk factors: age (60 years or older), family history of the disease and obesity. Even one risk factor is a reason enough to do a quick self-exam every three months.Marriage Benefits Men More Than WomenThis debunking comes courtesy of David Popenoe, of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. Although it's often stated matter-of-factly that men get the lion's share of health benefits from marriage, that's not necessarily true, Popenoe says.Recent research indicates that men and women benefit about equally from marriage, although in different ways. Both men and women live longer, happier, healthier and wealthier lives when they are married.Men Don't Have Fertility CyclesAccording toAskmen.com, a man's sperm count is affected by the time of the year and the time of day.Generally sperm counts go up in the winter and down in the summer, possibly because sperm production is increased in cooler temperatures. A man's sperm count is also highest in the morning, matching the time when male hormone levels are also at their daily high.Shaving Causes Hair To Grow Back ThickerFor some reason this myth has endured for quite some time despite tons of evidence to the contrary. AsYahoo!tells us, as far back as 1928 a clinical trial showed that shaving had no affect on the thickness or rate or hair growth. Despite this being confirmed by many studies since, the myth won't go away.The reason behind the myth might be that shaved hair is blunt and doesn't taper at the ends, meaning it can look to be coarser. Plus, new hair can appear to be darker, but only because the sun hasn't had a chance to bleach it yet.Erectile Dysfunction Is All In Your HeadThe men's health websitewww.4-men.orgnotes that between 70 and 90 percent of men suffering from erectile dysfunction have an underlying physical cause for their impotence.Health problems, such as diabetes, heart conditions and trauma can lead to erectile dysfunction. Lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol and drug use can also add to the problem. So while psychological factors may play a role, erectile dysfunction is most-often a sign that something is wrong physically as well.Prostate Cancer Is An Old Man's DiseaseAsDummies.com, the website for the company behind those black and yellow "... For Dummies" books, tells us, younger men can also develop prostate cancer.Yes, men age 65 years old and older are at a higher risk for prostate cancer, but men in their 40s and 50s and even younger can also be diagnosed with the disease."If a younger man believes that you have to be old to die from prostate cancer, and then he is diagnosed with the disease, he may think that he doesn't have to worry," reports the website. "He may then avoid or delay treatment for years, based on this erroneous assumption. Don't make the same mistake."Tight Hats Cause BaldnessIt doesn't take much Internet searching to debunk this long-held myth. From Snopes.com to Men's Health, there is tons of information out there decrying this one. Yet, it lives on.The websitewww.hair-styles.orgtheorizes that the myth got its start in the military when young men entering the service were required to wear hats and soon showed signs of thinning hair. But the connection was more likely mere coincidence, since the age the men enter the military is also the same age that male pattern hair loss generally begins.Men Don't Get OsteoporosisiStock/toranicoFind out how slow-growing prostate cancer is treated.iStock/moneybusinessimagesLearn different ways to cope with a new prostate cancer diagnosis here.iStock/artmannwitteFind out how hormone therapy can be used against prostate cancer.iStock/svanhornWhile there's no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, there are things you can do to reduce your risk.iStock / digitalskilletA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test can check men for the signs of prostate cancer.

EPA officials announced in November that it would be rewritten after members of a peer review panel raised concerns about its content, including clarifying its stated objective.Writers of the assessment were careful to distance the document from the Pebble Mine itself, although it was based on data submitted for the Pebble project by Northern Dynasty Minerals and the Pebble Partnership.“To assess mining-related stressors that could affect ecological resources in the watershed, we developed realistic mine scenarios that include a range of mine sizes and operating conditions,” officials wrote. “These mine scenarios are based on the Pebble deposit because it is the best-characterized mineral resource and the most likely to be developed in the near term.”In a Friday statement on the assessment, Pebble Partnership spokesperson John Shively blasted the EPA’s conclusions as based on speculation rather than actual information from Pebble’s mine plans.“While we need to review the document in detail, it seems the EPA has not changed its deeply flawed approach of creating and evaluating a completely hypothetical mine plan, instead of waiting until a real, detailed mine plan is submitted to regulators as part of a complete permit application,” Shively wrote in a Friday statement. “By continuing on this course, the EPA is ignoring a chorus of scientific, legal and regulatory criticism, not to mention the legitimate questions that have been raised by at least three different committees of the U.S. Congress.”According to an executive summary (PDF) of the draft assessment, the document considers three scenarios for production from the Pebble deposit, in which it produces 250 million, 2 billion or 6.5 billion tons of ore. The EPA, which calls the scenarios “Pebble 0.25,” “Pebble 2.0” and “Pebble 6.5,” estimates they would take 20, 25 or 78 years to play out respectively.Four threats to salmon stocks in the region are taken up in the document: areas denied to fish by the mine’s construction “footprint” and downstream areas, possible effects on water quality, potential problems along the mine’s transportation corridor, and the consequences of any tailings dam failures.The assessment says the hypothetical mine’s footprint could consume 24, 56 or 90 miles of streams under the scenarios it lays out, with an additional 1,200, 3,000 or 4,800 acres of wetlands claimed by work on the facility. In addition to direct habitat loss, the assessment says indirect effects could also occur.“Reductions in streamflow exceeding 20% would adversely affect habitat in an additional 15, 26 and 54 km (9.3, 16 and 34 miles) of streams under the Pebble 0.25, 2.0, and 6.5 scenarios, respectively, reducing production of sockeye salmon, coho salmon, Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and Dolly Varden,” officials wrote.Other possible effects to downstream fish habitats include reductions in available food, in addition to temperature changes as mining alters the balance of surface water and groundwater.“These indirect effects cannot be quantified, but likely would diminish fish production downstream of the mine site,” officials wrote.The EPA says water quality effects of routine leakage of copper, an element highly toxic to salmon, could range from affecting aquatic invertebrates on which salmon feed to killing fish in up to 12 kilometers of streams. Its draft assessment reserved its worst prognosis for a worst-case scenario, involving the total failure of the mine’s wastewater-treatment plant and the release of untreated water.“Under that scenario, copper concentrations would be sufficient to cause direct effects on salmonids in 45, 100, and 100 km (28, 63, and 64 miles) of streams and on aquatic invertebrates in 100, 110, and 130 km (62, 68, and 80 miles) of streams in the Pebble 0.25, 2.0, and 6.5 scenarios, respectively,” officials wrote. “Under the Pebble 6.5 scenario, death of fish would occur rapidly in 31 km (19 miles) of stream following treatment failure, but effects on fish would be less severe in the other scenarios.”The assessment says roads to a mine in the area would have to cross 53 streams which are known or likely to support salmon, using about 35 culverts to let such streams flow beneath the roads. Although the EPA noted the possibility of ore-processing chemicals spilling in truck accidents, it says the culverts pose more threats to salmon, ranging from being blocked or washed out to “smothering” downstream eggs and alevins in silt.“If blockages occurred during adult salmon immigration or juvenile salmon emigration and were not cleared for several days, production of a year-class (i.e., fish spawned in the same year) could be lost or diminished from that stream above the culvert,” officials wrote.The numbers of tailings storage facilities and dams in the EPA’s scenarios for mining the Pebble deposit varies, with one facility and one dam under Pebble 0.25, one facility and three dams under Pebble 2.0, and three facilities and nine dams under Pebble 6.5. Although the possibility of a dam failure is remote in the short term, estimated at occurring every 2,500 to 250,000 years, the report emphasizes the dams’ effective permanence.“Because there is no plan for their removal when mining activities cease, the TSFs and their component dams are likely to be in place for hundreds to thousands of years, long beyond the life of the mine,” officials wrote.Were a dam to fail, the EPA says it would have severe consequences for fish habitat in the region, with tailings slurry “scouring” the valley which hosts the north fork of the Koktuli River -- home to several populations of spawning salmon.“More than 30 km of salmonid stream would be destroyed and more streams and rivers would have greatly degraded habitat for decades,” officials wrote.The report notes that any adverse impacts on fish in Bristol Bay would have follow-on effects upon Alaska Natives and their culture, as well as predators in the area that rely on fish.In the Pebble Partnership statement, Shively reiterated its commitment to operating any approved mine safely, citing its much longer involvement with the project than the EPA.“We have spent the better part of ten years working on designing a development plan for a mine at the Pebble Deposit utilizing some of the premiere mining engineers and environmental scientists in the world,” Shively wrote. “The EPA has spent two short years on a desktop exercise with little or no input from miners. Anyone can design a mine that fails. We’ll design a mine that will operate safely and responsibly and will meet the high regulatory standards for development in Alaska.”The environmental group Trout Unlimited hailed Friday’s revised assessment as a step toward stopping development of the Pebble project.“The science is clear: developing Pebble Mine will harm salmon and destroy streams even if nothing ever goes wrong at the mine,” said Tim Bristol, director of the group’s Alaska program. “Pebble is far bigger and more threatening to renewable resource jobs than any other mine proposal in Alaska and it’s planned for the worst location possible: the headwaters of Bristol Bay. Clearly, the time for action to protect Bristol Bay under the Clean Water Act is now.”Sen. Mark Begich issued a measured statement on the revised assessment Friday, taking note of the EPA’s previous hearings to gather public comment on the first draft of the assessment.“While I remain opposed to a pre-emptive veto of this or any other project, an open, public process that answers Alaskans’ questions and puts better science on the table is a good thing,” Begich said. “I look forward to reviewing this assessment and hope it answers questions about whether this project can meet the high hurdle of developing a large-scale mine while protecting our renewable resources.”Unknown information is a recurring theme in the assessment, with EPA officials pointing out holes in current knowledge regarding the long-term behavior of engineered waste storage for mines, the nature and effects of any future accidents or the eventual fate of any spilled tailings from the mine.“Mine management or ownership may change over time,” officials wrote. “Over the long time span (centuries) of mining and post-mining care, generations of mine operators must exercise due diligence. Priorities are likely to change in the face of financial circumstances, changing markets for metals, new information about the resource, political priorities, or any number of currently unforeseeable changes in circumstance.”The EPA plans to take public comments on the revised draft assessment on its website until May 31. It will then undergo peer review by scientists, with the agency planning to release a final assessment later this year.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

That's why you add sliced fruit to your fortified breakfast cereal, top your salads with chickpeas and snack on almonds. But do you know what foods to avoid during pregnancy?Start with the basics in pregnancy nutrition. Understanding what foods to avoid during pregnancy can help you make the healthiest choices for you and your baby.Seafood can be a great source of protein, and the omega-3 fatty acids in many fish can promote your baby's brain and eye development. However, some fish and shellfish contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury. Too much mercury could harm your baby's developing nervous system.The bigger and older the fish, the more mercury it's likely to contain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) encourage pregnant women to avoid:So what's safe? Some types of seafood contain little mercury. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 8 to 12 ounces — two average meals — of seafood a week for pregnant women. Consider:However, limit albacore tuna and tuna steak to no more than 6 ounces (170 grams) a week. Also, be aware that while canned light tuna on average appears safe, some testing has shown that mercury levels can vary from can to can.In addition, keep in mind that not all researchers agree with these limits, citing a study that noted no negative effects for women who ate more seafood than the FDA-approved guidelines.To avoid harmful bacteria or viruses in seafood:During pregnancy, you're at increased risk of bacterial food poisoning. Your reaction might be more severe than if you weren't pregnant. Rarely, food poisoning affects the baby, too.To prevent foodborne illness:Many low-fat dairy products — such as skim milk, mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese — can be a healthy part of your diet. Anything containing unpasteurized milk, however, is a no-no. These products could lead to foodborne illness. Avoid soft cheeses, such as Brie, feta and blue cheese, unless they are clearly labeled as being pasteurized or made with pasteurized milk. Also, avoid drinking unpasteurized juice.To eliminate any harmful bacteria, thoroughly wash all raw fruits and vegetables. Avoid raw sprouts of any kind — including alfalfa, clover, radish and mung bean — which also might contain disease-causing bacteria. Be sure to cook sprouts thoroughly.Caffeine can cross the placenta and affect your baby's heart rate. While further research is needed, some studies suggest that drinking too much caffeine during pregnancy might be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.Because of the potential effects on your developing baby, your health care provider might recommend limiting the amount of caffeine in your diet to less than 200 milligrams a day during pregnancy. For perspective, an 8-ounce (237-milliliter) cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine, an 8-ounce (237-milliliter) cup of brewed tea contains about 47 milligrams and a 12-ounce (355-milliliter) caffeinated cola soft drink contains about 33 milligrams.No email address was supplied by.

Give. program manager, Heather Beaty said more than 26,000 Alaskans donated over $2.8 million."We're so excited that this year has been the best ever so far," Beaty said.Out of more than 500 nonprofit groups that participated, Bean's Cafe was this year's top earner, setting a new record of raising more than $143,000."The organizations that seem to do the best through Pick.Click.Give. do a lot to tell their story, letting Alaskans know they're part of the program and making that ask, making them know that you can donate as little as $25," Beaty said. "When all of us are giving a little through our PFD, it makes a really big difference."Bean's Cafe executive director, Lisa Sauder, said it's going to put the money into child nutrition programs, like the Children's Lunchbox weekend food program as well as providing meals for their clients every day."Our budget is about $3 million, so this makes a nice dent in that," Sauder said. "What's great is they are unrestricted funds so we can use it in a variety of capacities."Sauder said the weekend program provides nearly 2,800 children everyFridaywith food to last them toMonday.Other nonprofit groups like YMCA raised more than $2,000, which will be used to provide scholarships for children to participate in activities like swimming lessons, ballet and jiu-jitsu.YMCA's diabetes prevention coordinator, Erin Widener, said the scholarships provide opportunities for those who would otherwise not be able to afford to participate."It's very important we want our kids to be healthy, we want our families to be healthy and if we cannot have that support and to give those tools to our families to help them out, then we have kids that are not getting to play," Widener said.As the nonprofit groups celebrate success, it's a message they said speaks volumes about Alaskans."I think many Alaskans can understand how hard it is to maintain a living and that so many people are literally one paycheck, one medical issue, one car accident, one bad decision away from losing their housing and their job and all of their security," Sauder said.The Children's Lunchbox "Nourish Their Dreams" fundraiser kicks offThursday, 8 p.m. at the Alaska Aviation Museum hangar.For the first time, Bean's Cafe is cooking its own food and providing Alaska themed items on the menu like Alaskan gumbo and salmon.All money raised will go toward the Children's Lunchbox weekend food program.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

James Kenner had 17 carries for 89 yards and Will Tye had a 10-yard TD reception to help the Seawolves snap a two-game losing skid against the Black Bears.Maine (2-4, 1-2) took an early lead as Dan Collins connected with Jeremy Salmon on a 73-yard touchdown pass on the Black Bears' second play from scrimmage. Collins completed 12-of-25 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown before leaving early in the fourth quarter with a possible head injury. Stony Brook, which entered the game with the top-ranked FCS total defense, settled in after the big play and trailed 7-3 at the half. Bednarski opened the second half with three passes to three different receivers for 41 yards and Bedell capped the drive with a 24-yard touchdown run.The Seawolves drove 77 yards in 10 plays late in the third quarter and moved ahead 16-7 on Tye's 10-yard TD reception before Przemyslaw Popek drilled a 35-yard field midway through the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Maine was held to 18 rushing yards and six first downs while converting just one of 12 third-down attempts.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

The driver of Gust’s snowmachine, 35-year-old Myrtle Kaye Ishnook, was unhurt.“Investigation revealed (Ishnook) had driven his Polaris snowmachine into a berm at the edge of a frozen lake,” troopers wrote. “The impact caused Ishnook's snowmachine to travel airborne 55 feet before it contacted the ground where it flipped and rolled an additional 70 feet.”Troopers say the second snowmachine “also struck the berm where also both were ejected.”Ishnook was pronounced dead at the scene after his collision, with his body first taken to King Salmon. Gust was initially treated in Koliganek -- about 65 miles northeast of Dillingham -- for his injuries before being taken to Dillingham for additional care.“None of the travelers were wearing protective helmets at the time of the collision,” troopers wrote. “Alcohol use is suspected to be a contributing factor.”AST spokesperson Megan Peters couldn’t immediately answer questions Sunday about what family relationship if any existed between the snowmachines’ drivers, the nature of the suspected alcohol use in the incident, whether the snowmachines were racing at the time of the crashes or which way the snowmachines were traveling between New Stuyahok and Koliganek.Ishnook’s body will be sent to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage for an autopsy. His next of kin have been notified.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"They will help with figuring out run timing, abundance estimates and will help us set our escapement goals."Since the beginning of the year, crews have worked five days a week assembling tens of thousands of pieces to make 750 feet of weir material. The new weirs will improve the management of the king salmon. In the past, these four locations were measured by an aerial count but it takes a weir on the ground to get a more exact number."Fish and game wanted to make sure we know how many Chinook salmon are in this system," Erickson said. "Distribution of these Chinook salmon is of real importance to making decisions associated with permitting Sustina-Watana."The department plans to install these new weirs in the four locations at the end of May. From that point, the department will be counting King Salmon until the end of June.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The helicopters were radioed by Mike Morgan, the owner of the downed Cessna, and asked for assistance in the search.“The Chinook assisted and located the downed craft and two civilianpersonnel,” Pennell wrote. “The civilians were uninjured, but were surrounded by water and muskeg.”One of the Chinooks obtained permission to land from the 11th Air Force’s Rescue Coordination Center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, then set down and picked up the plane’s occupants.Pennell says the region where the plane crashed was fairly inaccessible, except by air.“The area they were in was just like a marsh,” Pennell said.The Chinook that picked up the Cessna’s occupants eventually returned to Fort Wainwright, first dropping them off at the Nenana airfield to be reunited with Morgan.Hatch says the crash was called in to authorities by the pilot, since both of the plane’s occupants were unharmed. The proximity of the crash site to Nenana meant a rescue didn’t take very long.“They had to wait out there in the pucker brush just a bit for a ride,” Hatch said.Hatch says NTSB investigators are waiting to hear more about the nature of the aircraft’s damage to decide whether a full investigation of the crash is warranted.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

North Dakota Braces For Worst<COL>The National Weather Service has raised its Red River crest forecast at Fargo to as much as 43 feet as North Dakota's largest city struggles to protect itself from potentially disastrous flooding.Forecasters had been predicting a crest of 41 feet by Saturday afternoon at Fargo. The new guidance issued Thursday is between 41 and 42 feet, but the weather service said it could go as high as 43 feet.Fargo has been rushing to raise its dike protection to 43 feet. Thousands of people were taking part in an around-the-clock effort of stacking sandbags to protect the city.Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker asked workers and volunteers to add another foot to the height of the dikes.Several nursing homes were evacuating residents ahead of the floodwaters, while people continued to leave homes south of Fargo.Police were urging people with disabilities to consider leaving the city, and hospital officials were identifying patients who may need to be moved early. A dozen rescues were planned in the Fargo area Thursday.Earlier, Walaker told the CBS "Early Show" that they're building secondary dikes to protect the city in case the first line of defense fails. He said the river's level is hitting "uncharted territory."Just to the north of neighboring Moorhead, Minn., officials said they needed more volunteers to keep a low-lying township from being inundated.A few homes have already flooded, and crews were trying to get the sandbags in place while it was still possible. About 500 homes were threatened there.To the west, officials in Bismarck were battling ice jams in the Missouri River. Demolition crews blasted chunks of ice Wednesday in a bid to open a channel. Officials planned two more rounds of explosives.The jam developed south of Bismarck Sunday when a chunk of ice said to be the size of a football field got stuck on a sandbar.Bismarck Mayor John Warford said officials were "cautiously optimistic."Water backing up behind the dam of ice blocks already has forced the evacuation of about 1,700 people from low-lying areas.President Barack Obama has declared the entire state of North Dakota a disaster area in response to widespread flooding.Tornado Damages Small Miss. TownIn the South, authorities have begun to get a clearer picture of the damage done overnight in rural Mississippi, after a line of severe storms blew through several southern states last night, spawning two tornadoes.The mayor of Magee, Miss., said at least 17 people were injured, but there have been no reports that anyone was killed. However, dozens of homes were damaged and a church flattened.Mayor Jimmy Clyde said it's "like reliving Hurricane Katrina all over again." He said authorities were trying to restore power and clear roads of utility lines, tree branches and metal scrap. He described some homes as "basically leveled."One man said he and his wife were asleep when the storm hit around 1:30 a.m. He said the windows shattered, and the storm tore the roof off of his house as the two of them sought shelter in a closet.Damage was also being reported in Alabama and Louisiana, while Georgia residents were bracing for heavy rains Thursday.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.

Fish and Game says the restrictions were implemented in an attempt to achieve escapement goals.More than sixty fishermen allegedly defied those restrictions and many are currently fighting for the right to fish based on religious grounds.John Linderman, a supervisor with Fish and Game for the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Arctic regions, says forecasts for the Kuskokwim were still being worked on.“One thing that we do feel at this time, based on the information and the status of our forecast is we certainly wouldn't expect to see more restrictive actions based on pre-season information,” Linderman said.Contact: Dan Carpenter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Thirty million dollars has been dedicated to the new research over the next five years. Twelve Chinook salmon stalks from the Yukon River to South East Alaska will be monitored throughout their life cycle to better understand what’s happening to the fish. Last year low king returns lead to restrictions on rivers throughout the state. Fish and game says this caused hardship to Alaska’s fisheries, including subsistence users. Bob Clark is a Chief Fisheries Scientist with Fish and Game’s Sport Fish Division. He says the new research is aimed at avoiding a similar crisis in the future, “This is a big deal, this is a pretty huge deal. Thirty million dollars over five years is a lot of money, a lot of responsibility to do the best job possible.”The extra research money will supplement what’s already being spent on research. It’s welcome news for subsistence users of king salmon.“It's defiantly a step in the right direction that the legislature and the governor's office is moving this forward,” said Tim Andrew with the Association of Village Council Presidents.In addition to Bob Clark leading the sport fishing research for this project, Fish and Game has people dedicated to subsistence and commercial fishing.Contact: Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

If you want to reduce your risk of prostate cancer, consider trying to:Maintain a healthy weightMen with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher are considered obese. Being obese increases your risk of prostate cancer. If you are overweight or obese, work to lose weight. You can do this by reducing the number of calories you eat each day and increasing the amount of exercise you do.If you have a healthy weight, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week and choosing a healthy diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Exercise most days of the weekStudies of exercise and prostate cancer risk have mostly shown that men who exercise may have a reduced risk of prostate cancer. But not all studies have agreed. Exercise has many other health benefits and may reduce your risk of heart disease and other cancers. Exercise can help you maintain your weight, or it can help you lose weight.If you don't already exercise, make an appointment with your doctor to ensure it's OK for you to get started. When you begin exercising, go slowly. Add physical activity to your day by parking your car farther away from where you're going, and try taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.Talk to your doctor about your riskSome men have an increased risk of prostate cancer. For those with a very high risk of prostate cancer, there may be other options for risk reduction, such as medications.

But do you know how the aging process will affect your teeth, heart and sexuality? Find out what kind of changes you can expect in your body as you continue aging — and what you can do to promote good health at any age.What's happeningAs you age, your heart rate becomes slightly slower and your heart might become bigger. Your blood vessels and your arteries also become stiffer, causing your heart to work harder to pump blood through them. This can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other cardiovascular problems.What you can doTo promote heart health:What's happeningWith age, bones tend to shrink in size and density — which weakens them and makes them more susceptible to fracture. You might even become a bit shorter. Muscles generally lose strength and flexibility, and you might become less coordinated or have trouble balancing.What you can doTo promote bone, joint and muscle health:What's happeningConstipation is more common in older adults. Many factors can contribute to constipation, including a low-fiber diet, not drinking enough fluids and lack of exercise. Medications — such as diuretics and iron supplements — and certain medical conditions — such as diabetes and irritable bowel syndrome — also might contribute to constipation.What you can doTo prevent constipation:What's happeningLoss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) is common with aging. Medical conditions, such as diabetes, might contribute to incontinence — as can menopause, for women, and an enlarged prostate, for men.What you can doTo promote bladder and urinary tract health:What's happeningMemory tends to becomes less efficient with age. It might take longer to learn new things or remember familiar words or names.What you can doTo keep your memory sharp:If you're concerned about memory loss, consult your doctor.What's happeningWith age, you might have difficulty focusing on objects that are close up. You might become more sensitive to glare and have trouble adapting to different levels of light. Aging also can affect your eye's lens, causing clouded vision (cataracts).No email address was supplied by.

"It's being billed as a way to stop pebble and it's not gonna stop pebble."Mark Newman, a retired Alaskan who worked for more than 30 years in water treatment for Anchorage, said there are more questions that need answers before companies are allowed to conduct large-scale mining projects."It's about clean water and I don't think this mine can be done in an environmentally sensitive manner," Newman said.Whether they agreed or disagreed, Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said the goal of the hearing was to make sure Alaskans have opportunities to get educated before they vote."This is a case where you can come to our hearing, you can hear the law from the person who's sponsoring it, you can hear from the people who will have to implement the law and you can hear from the people who oppose the law," Treadwell said.There will be another hearing on the initiative Sept. 30th in Fairbanks and another Oct. 2nd in Dillingham.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

A second closure, from July 1 through July 14, will affect the Kenai from Fish and Game emergency markers about 300 yards downstream of Slikok Creek’s mouth to Skilak Lake’s outlet upstream.The Moose River, from its confluence with the Kenai to the northernmost edge of the Sterling Highway bridge, will be closed to fishing for kings for the duration of both closures from Thursday through July 14.“Through June 16, the DIDSON sonar estimates of king salmon passage and all indices used to assess abundance of early-run king salmon in the Kenai River indicate the 2013 run is the lowest on record,” Ryan wrote. “Given the unprecedented low number of early-run king salmon, the department has determined that it is necessary to close the Kenai River to sport fishing for early-run king salmon.”Tuesday’s emergency order was one of several issued by Fish and Game, including a Kasilof River order restricting fishing to unbaited single hooks from June 20 to June 30, as well as one opening the Russian River Sanctuary to sockeye salmon fishing effective at 8 a.m. Wednesday.This is a developing story.

At just 1 week old, she weighed just over 2 pounds.A person taking an evening walk heard the pup's cry and found her alone on Coastways Beach near San Mateo County, California."On arrival at Monterey Bay Aquarium, "Pup 681" weighed 1.0kg, which is tiny for a newborn sea otter, and she had been separated from mom for at least 16 hours. This meant it was critical that we begin to get calories into her as quickly as possible," said Karl Mayer, animal care coordinator for the Sea Otter Program.Since arriving at the Shedd, "Pup 681" has been receiving round-the-clock care from animal care specialists, learning essentially how to be an otter.She reaches new milestones every day, such as taking formula from a bottle and eating solids.No email address was supplied by.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such as heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating more fiber and lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number you burn off in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such as depression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems with pregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, and influenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to the age of 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.For people older than 60, the vaccine Zostavax was licensed by the FDA in 2006 to prevent shingles. Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chicken pox. After an attack of chicken pox, the virus lies dormant in certain nerve tissue. As people age, it is possible for the virus to reappear in the form of shingles, which is estimated to affect two in every 10 people in their lifetime. Shingles is characterized by clusters of blisters, which develop on one side of the body. The blisters can cause severe pain that may last for weeks, months or years after the virus reappears. Studies showed that the vaccine reduced the occurrence of shingles between 50 and 64 percent.iStock/toranicoFind out how slow-growing prostate cancer is treated.iStock/moneybusinessimagesLearn different ways to cope with a new prostate cancer diagnosis here.iStock/artmannwitteFind out how hormone therapy can be used against prostate cancer.iStock/svanhornWhile there's no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, there are things you can do to reduce your risk.iStock / digitalskilletA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test can check men for the signs of prostate cancer.

Washington Na...<COL>NEW YORK -- The 1990 M.C. Hammer hit "U Can't Touch This" blared inside the New York Mets' locker room Friday night. Contrary to what the Mets might have thought, the song was not topping the charts the last time they beat the Washington Nationals.The Mets finally beat the Nationals at Citi Field on Friday night, when center fielder Juan Lagares snapped a fifth-inning tie with an RBI double and a trio of pitchers threw 3 2/3 innings of shutout ball in relief of winning right-hander Dillon Gee in the Mets' 4-3 victory.The Mets' win snapped a 12-game losing streak against the Nationals at Citi Field, the longest home losing streak the Mets have ever endured against a single opponent. The Atlanta Braves beat the Mets 10 straight times at Shea Stadium from June 12, 1991 through Sept. 1, 1992."We've played them good, they're just really tough," Mets manager Terry Collins said of the Nationals, who mounted comeback wins in four of their first seven games at Citi Field this season. "There's been a lot of nights where we've had them late in the game and they come back and do some big damage against us. But it was a good win tonight for us, for sure."The Mets jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, when catcher Travis d'Arnaud doubled with the bases loaded to bring home left fielder Eric Young and Lagares as well as first baseman Lucas Duda, who scored when Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos dropped the ball as he tried to tag Duda.The Nationals appeared ready to torment the Mets again when they scored twice in the third via RBI singles by first baseman Adam LaRoche and Ramos before tying the score in the fifth on a leadoff homer by third baseman Anthony Rendon.But the Mets scored what proved to be the final run in the bottom of the fifth, when Young led off with a single and scored easily on Lagares' double to left field."Division rivals (who) pretty much had our number all year," Young said. "We've got two more games (this weekend) and then we've got them there in Washington (Sept. 23-25), so hopefully we can take the momentum from tonight and carry it on."Gee, who also earned the win in the Mets' previous victory over the Nationals at Citi Field on June 29, 2013, improved to 7-7 following a laborious 5 1/3-inning stint. Gee, who had one 1-2-3 inning, allowed three runs on nine hits and two walks while striking out four."Kind of a weird night," Gee said. "It felt like early on every ball they hit was finding a hole or against the shift. It was just a weird night. But I'm glad I was able to at least keep us in the game. The offense and the bullpen did an amazing job and won it for us."Right-hander Carlos Torres induced a pair of inning-ending double plays over 1 2/3 innings before right-hander Jeurys Familia threw a scoreless eighth.Right-hander Jenrry Mejia earned his 26th save despite allowing a hit and issuing an intentional walk in the ninth. Mejia ended the game by whiffing shortstop Ian Desmond and punctuated the strikeout by making a fishing motion toward home plate."We'll try to settle him down a little bit," Collins said. "But gosh, it's a big win for us against a first-place team. There's no reason not to be excited."Lagares finished 2-for-3 with a stolen base for the Mets (72-76), who have won eight of their last 10.Despite the loss, the Nationals (83-63) saw their magic number for winning the National League East fall to eight by virtue of the Atlanta Braves' loss to the Texas Rangers.Rendon went 3-for-5 and finished a triple shy of the cycle. He is 6-for-10 with two homers, three RBIs and four runs scored in the first two games of the four-game series.Left-hander Gio Gonzalez (8-10) took the loss after surrendering four runs (three earned) on six hits and one walk while striking out seven over 6 2/3 innings.Gonzalez was unhappy when he was pulled with nobody on in the seventh. As manager Matt Williams got to the mound, Gonzalez slapped the ball into Williams' right hand."He's upset, and I understand that," Williams aid. "But I also want to do the best job I can to help us try to win a game."NOTES: Mets INF Daniel Murphy didn't play Friday, one day after he was hit on the left hand by a pitch. X-rays were negative, but the wrist remained swollen Friday. ... Wally Backman, who played for the Mets' World Series champions in 1986 and is currently the manager of their Triple-A affiliate, will join the major league coaching staff next Friday and spend the final nine games with the team. Backman has led Las Vegas to back-to-back playoff berths. ... Nationals RF Jayson Werth received a routine day off. Manager Matt Williams said Werth had "dead legs." ...

Now that the season is winding down, fishery managers are looking at the number of fish counted at escapement monitoring projects.The fish and wildlife service say one of its weir on the Kwethluk River barely counted 75 percent of its lower escapement goal, and the weir on the Tuluksak saw one of its lowest results, saying only three other years were worse.“We certainly would have like to have seen better numbers escaping on our lower rivers but what we did get was better than had we not had those restrictions in place,” said Fish and Wildlife Service Acting Deputy Manager for the Yukon-Delta National Wildlife Refuge Brian McCaffery.Federal managers say there were some positives this season. It was the 4th highest year for Coho salmon which helped people meet subsistence needs, also larger kings were seen up river than in past.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Mark Begich and his Republican challenger Dan Sullivan met for their first general-election debate Wednesday evening.The two candidates went head-to-head at the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Wendy Williamson Auditorium. The group United for Liberty hosted the event.A few hundred people gathered to watch as the candidates faced questions ranging from international issues to problems here at home.The debate marked the first time Begich and Sullivan, the state’s former attorney general, have faced each other since the primary election. Their first question: how to best handle declines in fish and game populations, including king salmon.“We need to make sure we're not limiting our opportunities -- and the federal government has done that with abuse of the Endangered Species Act,” Sullivan said. “And then making sure we have a partner in the federal government.”“Bycatch is still a problem, but there’s several things you can do,” Begich said. “For example, my committee deals with fisheries and Coast Guard; we are now looking at electronic monitoring, more observers that need to be funded properly. We need to ensure that new technology and innovation is available to go after bycatch.”The two candidates disagreed on health care and the Affordable Care Act, and whether it's helping or hurting Alaskans.“Prior to this bill passing, 34 percent were denied health care,” Begich said. “Maybe you don't see those people -- I do.”“There were many things within the bill,” Sullivan said. “If you understood it, you would understand the promises about keeping your health care plan, reducing premiums -- that couldn't be kept.”Begich and Sullivan will face each other in the general election on Nov. 4.Dan Sullivan will be Steve Mac Donald's guest on “Alaska's Political Pipeline” Sunday morning at 8 a.m.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men. You may have friends or family members who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and this may make you wonder about what you can do for prostate cancer prevention.There's no sure way to prevent prostate cancer. Study results often conflict with each other, and no clear ways to prevent prostate cancer have emerged. In general, doctors recommend that men with an average risk of prostate cancer make choices that benefit their overall health if they're interested in prostate cancer prevention.Choose a healthy dietThere is some evidence that choosing a healthy diet that's low in fat and full of fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of prostate cancer, though study results haven't always agreed. If you want to reduce your risk of prostate cancer, consider trying to:Maintain a healthy weightMen with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher are considered obese. Being obese increases your risk of prostate cancer. If you are overweight or obese, work to lose weight. You can do this by reducing the number of calories you eat each day and increasing the amount of exercise you do.If you have a healthy weight, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week and choosing a healthy diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Exercise most days of the weekStudies of exercise and prostate cancer risk have mostly shown that men who exercise may have a reduced risk of prostate cancer. But not all studies have agreed. Exercise has many other health benefits and may reduce your risk of heart disease and other cancers. Exercise can help you maintain your weight, or it can help you lose weight.If you don't already exercise, make an appointment with your doctor to ensure it's OK for you to get started. When you begin exercising, go slowly. Add physical activity to your day by parking your car farther away from where you're going, and try taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.Talk to your doctor about your riskSome men have an increased risk of prostate cancer. For those with a very high risk of prostate cancer, there may be other options for risk reduction, such as medications. If you think you have a high risk of prostate cancer, discuss it with your doctor.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/in-depth/prostate-cancer-prevention/art-20045641No email address was supplied by.

Lisa Murkowski is hailing this year’s second large-scale federal purchase of Alaska pink salmon for food banks, saying it helps both the state’s fishermen and those in need across the nation.<COL>CREATIVE COMMONS / whologwhySen. Lisa Murkowski is hailing this year’s second large-scale federal purchase of Alaska pink salmon for food banks, saying it helps both the state’s fishermen and those in need across the nation.According to Murkowski’s office, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack authorized the purchase of $13 million in pink salmon as part of The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. Last month, Gov. Sean Parnellasked the USDA to consider buying $37 million in salmon,citing concerns echoed by Murkowski about a collapse of prices for the fish.“As Governor Parnell pointed out in his letter, USDA’s prior Section 32 purchase of Alaska pink salmon slowed price declines, but prices remain 23 percent lower than last year and the remaining unsold inventories have reduced the 2014 season’s advance price paid to fishermen by 33 percent,” Murkowski wrote in a July 29 letter to Vilsack. “Experts predict a serious value crisis without another Section 32 purchase.”Food Bank of Alaska Executive Director Michael Miller also expressed his appreciation for the purchase Wednesday.“We're so happy to see Secretary Vilsack understands the value of Alaska's nutritious and tasty salmon as a source of much needed protein for our struggling neighbors,” Miller said in the statement.Murkowski’s communications director, Matthew Felling, says the program is an intelligent use of existing federal funds to alleviate hunger.“I think it’s a fiscally responsible approach to dealing with food surpluses when millions of Americans are trying to do more with less,” Felling said. “It doesn’t add anything to the deficit, and helps people in need.”The second purchase followsa January decision by Vilsack to buy $20 million in pink salmonusing TEFAP funds, in response to a query from Murkowski. That deal bought an estimated 5,000 tons of salmon, which was distributed across the U.S. four to six weeks later.While the purchase may indicate that federal officials are amenable to future pink salmon purchases, Felling says the fluctuating nature of salmon supplies precludes scheduling regular TEFAP purchases.“We can’t predict surpluses, so we have to review it on an annual basis,” Felling said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Backers have billed the measure the "Bristol Bay Forever" initiative.Christina Salmon, one of the measure's sponsors, says she grew up in a subsistence lifestyle in Igiugig, a village on the west end of Lake Iliamna. Salmon says she feels an extra step in the permitting process would protect the region's fish."I understand the importance of Alaska's wild sockeye not only to the people in my community and my region...but my entire state," Salmon said.The initiative was challenged in Alaska Supreme Court by mining industry groups which argued that if passed it would be unconstitutional. In June, however, the court ruled that the measuredoesn't violate any provisions of the state constitution.Alaska Miners Association Executive Director Deantha Crockett says that despite the ruling, her organization will still fight to stop the measure."We still believe it's unconstitutional." Crockett said. "If the initiative is approved, the AMA will bring this issue before the courts again and will bring it before the courts again, and bring it to the attention of the public."Since 2008, Alaska has decided on three conservation-related ballot initiatives. Voters have rejected all three.Salmon says she hears people agreeing with her cause."I have a lot more support from people joining our cause, and being on our side, than people who are against us," Salmon said.That support will be tested on Nov. 4. Voters will also approve or reject ballot questions onlegalizing marijuanaandraising the state's minimum wage.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"I liked our show, but the travel got to be quite a bit. I just wanted to feel retired. That was my main reason for not doing it anymore, and they were cool about it."Urlacher played 13 seasons in the middle of the Bears' defense. He said when announcing his retirement that there was plenty of golf and fishing in his future but in July 2013, he was hired by FOX to join a show with former Vikings, Raiders, Titans and Patriots receiver Randy Moss and former Buccaneers cornerback Ronde Barber, along with FOX's Jay Glazer."We want to thank Brian for his effort and contributions since helping us launch the network last August," FOX Sports executive vice president John Entz said in a statement. "While we looked forward to having him as a member of the team this season and beyond, we understand his decision and wish him the best."After knee surgery, Urlacher had clearly lost a step in his final season with the Bears. When he reached free agency last offseason, Urlacher had only one concrete offer -- from the Bears -- but Chicago decided to move on rather than keep the contract on the table.Talk of a comeback was laughed off Tuesday by Urlacher, who said his next career move involves being the all-time pitcher in backyard kickball games.Reports Tuesday linked Urlacher to former Bears head coach Lovie Smith. The Tampa Bay Times reports Urlacher is "not far off" Smith's radar.More likely is a return to the Bears, if only for one Sunday, to be honored for his great career with the only team he played for in the NFL."I was not happy with the way it ended, but I've always had a ton of respect for George and the McCaskey family, for the Bears," Urlacher said. "I was not happy with the way it ended … I wanted to play another year there and I didn't get to. But I never lost any respect for George or anyone in that family."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

"Contrast this with the cost of cutting off the spikes or pales or completely replacing fencing within the next five years and it is easy to see that the total financial impact far outweighs the benefit of saving a few moose."The measure narrowly passed on a 6-5 vote at the Assembly’s Oct. 21 meeting. Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Jessy Coltrane testified before the Assembly that spiked fences occasionally kill moose when they try to step over them and become stuck. Others, however, said drivers hit and kill many more moose each year on local roads.Johnston said Wednesday afternoon that Sullivan stopped the measure due to confusion over language requiring homeowners to modify fences under 7 feet in height within the next five years. She said she thought the clause had been removed from the ordinance, allowing older fences to remain in place without modification, but it was still in place when the Assembly passed the measure into law.Coltrane declined to speak on camera Wednesday but Rick Sinnott, Coltrane’s predecessor as Fish and Game’s Anchorage-area biologist, said Fish and Game typically responds to two or three moose impaled on fences in the Anchorage area per year. It's a toll Sinnott, who spent much of his career protecting people from wildlife and vice versa in a city that bleeds into the wilderness, said steadily rose during his tenure.In addition to moose, other animals sometimes wounded themselves on the spikes but were able to struggle free, he said.“At first (there were) not that many -- we actually had more moose caught in chain-link fences,” Sinnott said. “It’s because there’s more fences, not because there’s more moose.”While many of the ungulates are dead by the time biologists arrive, Sinnott said in other cases biologists sometimes find the animals wounded. Some were shot, while others were freed from the fences to face an uncertain future due to their injuries.“Some of the time they’d live, but in most cases they would die of infection,” Sinnott said. “Most of the time they’d be eviscerated because it would be in the heart or the lungs.”According to Sullivan, one of the arguments against the palisade-fence ban is its limited scope relative to other means of protecting moose.“We could save a lot more moose by practicing safer driving habits on our roadways, at no cost to taxpayers and property owners,” Sullivan wrote. “Or, by not planting trees that are an attractive nuisance to moose -- trees that draw moose into roadways or actually make moose sick.”In Sinnott's view, moose killed on roads are a much larger problem -- but addressing it is also much more costly than Johnston's ordinance. He said most of Anchorage's palisade fences are smaller installations, concentrated in residential neighborhoods like West Anchorage and the Hillside."It seems like it’s a simple fix; most people don’t have these fences yet," Sinnott said. "Moose killed on roads is a much more complicated thing -- you can build fences along the Glenn Highway to keep them out of certain areas, but those cost millions of dollars."Sullivan's statement on his veto also echoed opponents of the palisade-fence ban who criticized its expansion of government power. Despite calling on city designers to avoid including palisade fencing in future public buildings, Sullivan said "the cost/benefit analysis does not warrant this level of government intrusion."Sinnott dismissed the government-overreach argument Wednesday, saying state authorities estimated the value of every living moose at more than $1,000 apiece. He also pointed out that city law bars the installation of barbed-wire fences between properties -- because they might harm humans who try to cross them.“I don’t think this is a huge overreach of government, where moose are essentially being tortured to death on these things,” Sinnott said. “You can have a different kind of fence or even the same kind of fence, a palisade fence, and it’s be just as attractive.”An eight-vote supermajority among the Assembly’s 11 members would be needed to override Sullivan’s veto. According to Johnston, it’s unlikely that the Assembly has the votes for an override.The body has had difficulty amassing that number,failing in August to defeat Sullivan's vetoof a measure replacing labor law AO37. That 7-4 vote put a suspended recall effort for AO37 back into play, and local voters will seea question asking whether the law should remain in effect on their state ballotsin Tuesday’s general election.In the meantime, Sinnott said Sullivan’s veto doesn’t account for moose behavior, which instinctively conditions them to jump over low obstacles.“They’re used to jumping over branches and maybe chain-link fences, which they can flop over, and when they jump over these they get impaled the first time and they die,” Sinnott said. “It’s something I’m afraid we’re going to see happening more often.”Channel 2's Adam Pinsker contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The bear, after noticing Thomas, attacked her multiple times. The two dogs that had been with Thomas left the area while she was being mauled.”AST spokesperson Megan Peters says the bear immediately shifted its focus to Thomas.“When the bear saw her, it veered off the dogs and went after her,” Peters said.Once the bear attacked Thomas, Peters says she took measures to protect herself, backing into some brush and entering a fetal position.“At one point, the bear stood up on its hind legs and she said it was six to seven feet tall,” Peters said. “This was a very angry bear.”After the attack, Thomas stayed at the scene as the bear departed.“The bear eventually left her and walked in the direction she needed to leave, so she waited a few minutes,” Peters said.Thomas was able to hike a mile and a half back to her vehicle, then drive herself to a hospital for treatment of her injuries. Both of the dogs in the incident rejoined her by the time she returned to the truck.“In this case, dogs are definitely an aggravating factor,” Peters said. “The victim is very familiar with the outdoors and very familiar with this trail.”The trail has been closed for the next week, after troopers coordinated with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Forest Service.“She was able to stay calm and essentially she saved herself,” Peters said. “She’s really lucky to be alive.”Troopers say no plans have been made to seek the bear.This is a developing story.

"I realized I couldn't go looking for her. I just had to get out of there."Bleeding badly, Thomas walked more than a mile back to her car."I just had to keep walking," Thomas said. "It was a chance that no one would have even looked for my car until the next day."Thomas drove herself to the local hospital and then had to be medevaced to Anchorage."The creek I was on, this is the thing I've seen more bears on that trail than any other trail I've been on," Thomas said. "It's salmon season, there were carcasses, salmon carcasses all up and down the creek."The experience was a lesson."Sometimes I'll carry a horn 'cause I hear that's a pretty good deterrent, but I don't own bear mace," Thomas said. "I've never carried a gun, so my takeaway lesson is don't be stupid and carry some sort of deterrent."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Mark Begich.<COL>2014 GOP Senate DebateDuring thefinal televised debatebefore the August 19 primary election, no love was lost between the Republicans who hope to unseat Sen. Mark Begich.But by the end of Thursday, it was clear Begich will likely be opposed by just one well-backed conservative candidate in November.Even before Channel 2 cameras started rolling, tempers started flaring.“Is Dan Sullivan here?” Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said to no one in particular. He grinned and pressed his hands against the podium. “I heard he’s dropping out of the race after he missed that debate last night.”The former attorney was general standing a step away. The joke was thatSullivan must have thrown in the towel because he sat out a Wednesday debatehosted by Alaska Public Media.While Joe Miller was making small talk before the debate got under way, he offered a line that came amid a story never entirely told about an incident on the campaign trail.“What planet am I on?” Miller said.Treadwell cut in: “That’s a question a lot of people have asked."The stage was set.Over the next hour at the University of Alaska Anchorage, there was predictable last-minute posturing – all the candidates emphasized that they are varying shades of anti-amnesty, they described their desire for smaller federal government, they spoke of what the sanctity of life means to them.And there were lip-furled mentions of Barack Obama, Mark Begich, Harry Reid and other fundamental trigger words, including fundamental,realconservatives and socialism.Maybe refined, rehearsed talking points signal that the contentious campaign has nearly run its course, just as emotionally-charged moments may exemplify what has been a sometimes hostile primary campaign.Dan Sullivan (right) reacts to Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell holding up a mailer. (Austin Baird / KTUU-TV)When moderator Steve Mac Donald opened the floor for Treadwell to ask Sullivan a question, the lieutenant governor offered up a pointed criticism of what he called attack ads, something he said has become commonplace in recent weeks.None seemed worse to Treadwell than a mailer deriding his "Washington doublespeak," which apparently included a photo of the lieutenant governor's face edited onto the body of another person.Sullivan responded that Treadwell should shed no "crocodile tears" due to the attacks he has launched, including the timehe was quoted sayingthere is a jar of mayonnaise in his cabinet that has been here longer than Sullivan.Treadwell stood by that jab and asked when Sullivan caught his first legal salmon in Alaska."I believe it's a fair issue," Treadwell said. "The question of your residency here is an issue in this campaign."A copy of the mailer that became a point of controversy during the debate. (Courtesy Mead Treadwell)Sullivan continually steered conversation to Begich, Reid, Obama and the like, and he faded into the background while some of the most heated exchanges of the debate unfolded."I'm actually quite upset with the racist mailer that Joe sent out on this issue," Treadwell said, referring to an adthat recently drew the attention of liberal blogs. "You wanted to tell us that there should be no taxpayer-funded benefits, and I'm going to tell you right now, if somebody is bleeding in the streets...we need to help them."Miller responded by speaking of people who have married into his family who were born in India, Indonesia and Mexico, and he said that immigration "is not a racism issue.""This is about tearing apart the fabric of this nation by saying that we're going to allow illegals to come in, become voters," Miller said.Miller and Treadwell also sparred over theUnited Nations Law of the Sea Treaty, which if ratified would give the U.S. more control over its waters, including those in the developing Arctic.Sullivan literally took a step back and watched the "significant disagreement," as Miller called it, unfold in real time.Miller:"You've been a lifelong proponent of the Law of the Sea Treaty. You think that's the pathway for the Arctic. I believe the pathway...is bilateral agreements with those nations that have Arctic regions within their coastlines."Treadwell:"Alaskans fought for many provisions in the Law of the Sea," Treadwell said. "For you to dismiss it and question our patriotism for trying to move forward protections for Alaska I think is disgusting."Miller:"I think it's disgusting, to be quite honest, that anyone would say because of money, we're going to give up sovereignty of the United States."The whole time the conversation carried on, for about five minutes, Sullivan spoke for fewer than 10 seconds.Dan Sullivan waits in the background while the camera focuses on Joe Miller. (Austin Baird / KTUU-TV)While the focus of the night was how the candidates are different from one another, the debate closed with a sign that there will be no repeat of 2010, when Miller surprised the Alaska Republican establishment by winning the 2010 nomination, only to be bested by write-in candidate Lisa Murkowski in the general election.Sullivan and Treadwell said they would support whoever wins the nomination.And so did Miller, who waspreviously rumoredto be weighing the possibility of running as an Independent if he lost the Republican nomination."I've never said this before," Miller said. "I believe I'm going to be the primary winner, but if one of you two guys win, I'll support you."We have to get rid of Mark Begich."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

He only caught one all morning, even though he could see them swimming all over the southern Seward Peninsula waterway.Harrelson decided it was time to slow down and take in his surroundings. He was near the bend in the river where, 20 or so years ago, his mother spotted the telling smooth surface of an ancient artifact.Harrelson remembers being either 3 or 4 years old, playing outside, when he spotted his parents ride home on a four-wheeler with a big tusk sticking off the back rack.“I knew it had to be something,” Harrelson said. “So I went over and checked it out, and they were still pretty in shock as well.”Harrelson says he doesn’t remember much from that moment, except his mother posing for a picture beside the curved relic.Since then, the particular river bend has revealed all sorts of treasures. Harrelson knows of at least two other wooly mammoth tusk finds, and numerous mammoth teeth discoveries.The bend is home to a deep fishing hole. White Mountain locals say it must have been an ancient mud hole, where migrating animals would get stuck and eventually die.That’s what Harrelson believes, too.On Sunday, when he realized where he was, he let up on his riverboat’s tiller and began scanning the water for fossils.He says it hadn’t been 10 seconds when his eye caught a dark shape poking out from beneath a root.“I spotted the root, the start of the tusk, you know,” he said. “It felt so unreal.”Harrelson repositioned his boat, threw his anchor out and called out to his fiancée, Renee Parker.“She said, ‘No way, how do you know?’" Harrelson said. "And I said, ‘I just have a feeling, you know.’”He described his find as a dark, greenish-black figure.“I knew it wasn’t a stick because there was no limbs, no branches coming off. It was really smooth,” he said. “I told myself, 'That’s a tusk.'”Parker began looking around and she found the tip of the tusk on the other side of the root.Harrelson enlisted a friend to help pull the mammoth find out of the water and brought it home to Nome.He says he is still deciding what to do with the tusk and has been considering several offers.His family jokes that it will be used as a wedding arch at his and Parker’s wedding.“If we still have it when the wedding comes," Harrelson said. "Why not?”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The Kenai Peninsula Fishermen's Association estimates east-side set netters lost 90 percent of their revenue in 2012.“It's important to note that this isn't complete relief -- it's just a incremental payout if you will,” said Jim Butler, president of Resources for All Alaskans. “So fishermen will be required to pay taxes on it and to address their crew, and so as any small-business person knows, any help is help and it's appreciated.”The rest of the fishery disaster relief fund will go toward helping other businesses.“There are some components in the second grant that would compensate guides, sport fishing businesses, lodges, entities such as that,” Mecum said.Longtime fishing guide Greg Brush says that whenever the money comes, the short king salmon runs have already done their damage.“My industry has lost hundreds of guides,” Brush said. “Some of them are part-timers and some of them are schoolteachers and such -- nonetheless, there has been a tremendous drop in fishing guides in this community.”Financial help is on its way, but for some the financial pains continue.“2014 has been as difficult a season as 2012, so we'll see what happens in the future,” said Ricky Gease, executive director of the Kenai River Sportfishing Association.With some of the federal money headed toward salmon research, the hope is that a long-term solution to chinook declines can be found.NOAA hopes to have money in the hands of fishermen by the end of September, but first they must return applications for the funds. According to NOAA, paperwork is being sent to permit holders.Channel 2's Dan Carpenter contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They were flown to the Mat-Su Regional Medical Center, with Hester being treated and released for mild hypothermia.AST spokesperson Megan Peters wasn’t immediately available for comment on the incident Thursday afternoon.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Troopers believe he went kayaking between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. that day, in a kayak that wasn’t accounted for at the scene.“The kayak is approximately 13 feet long,” troopers wrote. “It is a single-person kayak that has a light blue top with a white bottom. There is some black netting on the kayak.”Eggert says the case was first reported to the Coast Guard at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, with an AST helicopter also joining the search. Coast Guard broadcasts are asking mariners who see the kayak to contact watchstanders.Troopers say their search is focused on the river, as well as nearby Cook Inlet waters.Anyone with information on Osmar’s whereabouts is asked to call Soldotna troopers at 907-262-4453.This is a developing story.

Mitt Romney for Monday’s event, at the PenAir hangar near Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport Monday morning. Dozens of people were lined up outside the hangar to see Romney speak, as part of Sullivan’s final statement of his case against Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich.Speaking before supporters, Romney predicted that Sullivan would be Alaska’s next U.S. senator, citing the Obama administration’s record as a factor.“President Obama has made enormous errors in his foreign policy,” Romney said. "Sullivan represents change in Washington and is very prepared to serve in the U.S. Senate."Voters will decide Tuesday whether Begich, Alaska’s junior senator, will return to Washington, D.C. for a second six-year term. In addition to Sullivan, Libertarian Mark Fish and perennial candidate Ted Gianoutsos are also on the ballot.Begich campaigned in Fairbanks Monday, after swing through rural Alaska.   He shrugged off the impact of Sullivan bringing in Romney and Texas Senator Ted Cruz to stump for him."I think he has a desperate campaign, trying to win toward the end by bringing in these outsiders, but I brought in my mom, and my wife, they're up in Barrow, and Cordova, Homer, all around the state."Begich stood by his record of improving veteran's health and protecting the F-16s in Fairbanks, along with bringing F-35's to the region.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose campaign hassent Begich a cease-and-desist letter over TV adsclaiming that the two often vote in lockstep, kicked off the rally by cementing her support for Sullivan in Tuesday’s vote.“This isn’t just a vote against Mark Begich, it's a vote for a great man,” Murkowski said.Gov. Sean Parnell also put in an appearance, saying he was proud to have Sullivan as state attorney general and Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner.Prior to the event Sullivan, a former state attorney general and Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner, told Channel 2 that if elected to the Senate he will vote to roll back the Affordable Care Act, as well as most of Obama’s policies.Sullivan and Begich sparred ina debate hosted by Channel 2 last week,with Sullivan saying Begich’s policies toed a party line ordered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Begich responded by attacking Sullivan’s campaign funding as coming from Outside sources, including the GOP-aligned billionaire Koch brothers.Monday’s appearance came a day after a Sullivan rally in Fairbanks featuring Tea Party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Follow Channel 2’s @AdamPinsker on Twitter for more updates from the rally.This is a developing story.

But this is one case where following the crowd isn't a good idea. Carrying extra weight — especially belly fat — can be risky.Michael D. Jensen, M.D., an endocrinology specialist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., answers common questions about belly fat in men.The trouble with belly fat is that it's not limited to the extra layer of padding located just below the skin (subcutaneous fat). It also includes visceral fat — which lies deep inside your abdomen, surrounding your internal organs.Regardless of your overall weight, having a large amount of belly fat increases your risk of:Your weight is largely determined by how you balance the calories you eat with the energy you burn. If you eat too much and exercise too little, you're likely to pack on excess pounds — including belly fat.However, aging plays a role. As you age, you lose muscle — especially if you're not physically active. Loss of muscle mass decreases the rate at which your body uses calories, which can make it more challenging to maintain a healthy weight. In addition, in some men fat cells in the arms and legs lose the ability to store fat, which causes any excess fat to go to the abdomen.Your genes also can affect your chances of being overweight or obese, as well as play a role in where you store fat.Drinking excess alcohol can cause you to gain belly fat — the "beer belly." However, beer alone isn't to blame. Drinking too much alcohol of any kind can increase belly fat, although some research suggests wine might be an exception.If you drink alcohol, do so only in moderation. The less you drink, the fewer calories you'll consume and the less likely you'll be to gain belly fat.So how do you know if you have too much belly fat? Simply measure your waist:For men, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) indicates an unhealthy concentration of belly fat and a greater risk of health problems.You can tone abdominal muscles with crunches or other targeted abdominal exercises, but just doing these exercises won't get rid of belly fat. However, visceral fat does respond to the same diet and exercise strategies that can help you shed excess pounds and lower your total body fat. To battle the bulge:To lose excess fat and keep it from coming back, aim for slow and steady weight loss — up to 2 pounds (1 kilogram) a week. Consult your doctor for help getting started and staying on track.Remember, you can lose belly fat — it just takes effort and patience. In fact, shedding even a few extra pounds can help you feel better and lower your risk of health problems.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/mens-health/in-depth/belly-fat/art-20045685/No email address was supplied by.

Troopers say that search was canceled after Mann showed up at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday at the Bird Ridge Motel.AST spokeswoman Megan Peters wrote in an email to Channel 2 Monday that Mann spent half of his weekend off the trail after he became disoriented.“Mann is believed to have traveled roughly 12-15 miles on the trail, and another 12-15 miles off trail after getting lost,” Peters wrote.An Alaska Department of Fish and Game web pageon the 28-mile trail highlights its “incredible views and wildlife viewing opportunities,” but also emphasizes its potential dangers.“Trail use is recommended only during June, July, August, and September,” Fish and Game officials wrote. “Remain on the trail, especially during winter and spring when avalanche risk is high. Be prepared for a rocky route and inclement weather, including cool, wet, and windy conditions conducive to hypothermia.”When Mann left the Eagle River Nature Center at 8 a.m. Friday, troopers said his supplies were limited for what many hikers consider a two-day or even three-day trip.“Mann took very little with him -- he had a cell phone, but there is no cellphone service along the Crow Pass Trail,” Peters wrote. “In terms of other equipment he was only equipped with a sleeping bag and space blanket along with some food and water.”According to AST, Mann’s misstep came less than a day out of Eagle River.“Based on his statements, it’s believed that he lost the trail somewhere in the vicinity of Clear Creek and that he descended Clear Glacier,” Peters wrote. “He lost the trail in the dark after deciding to attempt to complete the trail overnight on the first night of his travel.”While Mann was working his way down the glacier and the Bird Creek drainage, both his friends and troopers were beginning to search the Girdwood side of the trail for him. Initial efforts to find the missing hiker reached as far north as Clear Creek.“Since he had not arrived by noon on Sunday, the trooper checked the Girdwood side of the trail on foot from the trailhead to a U.S. (Forest) Service cabin about 2.5 miles in,” Peters wrote. “The victim’s friends also hiked the trail to about the seven-mile mark.”Troopers say Mann reached the Seward Highway Sunday evening, but wasn’t able to get help until he reached the motel near Mile 101 of the highway.“Upon arriving in Bird, Mann knocked on the door to a local garage but was told to leave and that he was on private property,” Peters wrote. “Mann then tried to flag down several passing vehicles but traffic was light and no one stopped. He then knocked on the door to the Bird Ridge Motel and the owner took him in and called for help.”After Mann was evaluated by medics, troopers say friends of his finally took him home.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Republicans will choose their party's nominees in 10 House seats, as well as one in the Senate.Fenumiai says 19,043 people have voted absentee since Monday morning, that number was 22,338 through by this point in the 2010 primary.A voter ID card, driver's license, passport, military or tribal ID, even a hunting or fishing license are all accepted forms of identification to bring to the polls."You also may be personally known by the election worker, then they can waive the identification requirements, if you don't have identification, you're able to vote a questioned ballot," said Fenumiai.Questioned ballots will be verified by a non-partisan election review board after the primary.Channel 2's Mallory Peebles contributed to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They called the FAA’s Air Route Traffic Control Center in Anchorage at 7:57 a.m. to say they had reached the local airport’s holding pattern.A Federal Aviation Administration area navigation, or RNAV, chart for landing in Dillingham under instrument flight rules indicates the minimum altitudes planes should maintain at various points of their approach. The chart shows that as Day and Jensen’s flight came in from the southeast toward ZEDAG, the point at which planes enter the holding pattern to land in Dillingham, it should have been at an altitude of at least 5,400 feet, with only a slight reduction in that minimum within the pattern after arriving.“One of three peaks in the Muklung Hills with an elevation of 2,550 feet is located about 6 miles north-northwest of ZEDAG,” NTSB officials wrote. “The published minimum safe altitude while flying in the holding pattern is 4,300 feet (above mean sea level).”An NTSB log of transmissions shortly after between the ARTCC and the ACE Air Cargo flight, with the call sign Ace Air 51 or AER51, lists the plane at an altitude below those approved minimums. The controller, calling the Dillingham Flight Services Station for an update on runway conditions, apparently doesn’t notice:AER51: We'll stay with you.

Heavy snow and windkept searchers from reaching the crash site until the next day,when an Alaska Air National Guard chopper arrived and confirmed that both men were dead.NTSB investigators found that the plane had crashed at an elevation of about 2,000 feet, leaving an uphill fan of debris over several hundred feet from its point of contact. The crash destroyed three cockpit computers in the Beech, precluding any attempt to determine whether terrain warnings from them had been suppressed; while ACE Air Cargo had been installing cockpit video and flight recorders fleetwide after two people died in a 2010 crash near Sand Point, the wrecked aircraft didn’t yet have them.“The first structural piece was located about 400 feet from the initial impact point,” NTSB officials wrote. “Large sections of fuselage and expelled cargo were located about 525 feet from the initial impact point. The fuselage and cockpit were found separated into three large pieces.”When NTSB investigators spoke with the controller in the crash, he told them he hadn’t been fully aware of Day and Jensen’s altitude during their final minutes of flight.“During postaccident interviews, the controller who handled the flight stated that he did not expect the airplane to descend below 5,400 feet and that he did not notice when it did so,” NTSB officials wrote. “He stated that he did not notice the airplane's actual altitude when the pilot requested holding at ZEDAG. He stated that, when he cleared the pilot to hold at ZEDAG ‘as published,’ he expected the pilot to climb the airplane to 4,300 feet (above mean sea level) as shown in the profile view of the approach procedure.”Recorded data at the center indicated that the system had attempted to warn the controller about the imminent crash.“Air traffic control (ATC) recorded automation data showed that the airplane's trajectory generated aural and visual minimum safe altitude warnings (MSAW) on the controller's radar display, which included a 1-second aural alarm at 0809:16 and a flashing ‘MSAW’ indication in the airplane's data block that continued from 0809:16 until the end of the flight,” NTSB officials wrote. “The controller said that he was not consciously aware of any such warnings from his display. The controller did not issue any terrain conflict alerts or climb instructions to the flight crew.”While the NTSB report quotes FAA regulations calling for important numbers like altitude restrictions to be read back in communications between pilots and controllers, it quotes more extensively from those governing a pilot’s autonomy in flight – including one which states that “The pilot-in-command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.”“‘If ATC issues a clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from a rule or regulation, or in the pilot's opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy, IT IS THE PILOT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AN AMENDED CLEARANCE,’” NTSB officials quoted. “‘Similarly, if a pilot prefers to follow a different course of action…THE PILOT IS EXPECTED TO INFORM ATC ACCORDINGLY [capitalization emphasis in original document].’”Clint Johnson, the NTSB’s chief investigator in Alaska, says the report indicates shared responsibility for the crash both in the air and on the ground.“There’s culpability on both sides,” Johnson said. “There are a lot of checks and balances and safety initiatives that are in play, but for whatever reason they were all ignored.”Johnson says much about the crash that could be known never will be, due to the absence of voice or data recorders -- cheap technology that wasn’t required aboard the ACE flight.“One of the most frustrating things is that we don’t know what was going on in that cockpit,” Johnson said.Speaking with Channel 2 Monday afternoon, Johnson says that to his knowledge no criminal charges are pending against the controller in the crash."It's important to reiterate that this was an accident, first and foremost," Johnson said.The NTSB report also found that Day and Jensen violated company regulations governing descent approaches.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

With this method, cast your lure out to your target and let it fall into the water. When you retrieve the line, try to reel it in so it mimics a moving fish. Repeat this process.Topwater fishing:This technique uses a floating lure. According to TakeMeFishing.org, this method is executed the same as the Cast and Retrieve method, but having the lure on the top of the water mimics a dying fish.Jigging:TakeMeFishing.org states this is the best method for new fishermen and women. This technique makes the lure look like an injured fish. To do this, drop the lure straight down. When it hits the bottom, snap your wrist quickly. Then let the lure fall again. Keep repeating this process.Trolling:Trolling involves dragging lures behind the boat while the boat slowly moves forward. This will keep the lure moving, resembling a live fish.No email address was supplied by.

At about 8 a.m., the Coast Guard will give the vessel 36 gallons of fuel and escort the crew into Whittier.Lt. j.g. Victoria Swinghamer at the Coast Guard Sector Anchorage command center says the Bayliner, carrying 40-year-old John Dimmick, 28-year-old Mark Valdez and 25-year-old Corey Bicchinella, was spotted by a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter involved in the search Tuesday.“The vessel has been located, with the people aboard,” Swinghamer said. “The helicopter actually located them from the air.”The search for the Bayliner was prompted by the boat becoming disabled and out of reach by communications gear. The boat had left Whittier Sunday morning on a two-day fishing trip to the Perry Island area, with the Coast Guard conducting search operations Tuesday.“They’re actually in a spot that doesn’t have any VHF radio coverage -- they couldn’t hear us, we couldn’t hear them,” Swinghamer said. “There also wasn’t any cellphone coverage.”The men had been awaiting the Long Island's arrival Tuesday for assistance in proceeding to Whittier.Channel 2's Garrett Turner contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Chris Gifford says officers received a report from the Coast Guard at about noon Wednesday that 67-year-old Lawrence O. Dupler had been detained as an “intoxicated boater,” for operating a 52-foot tour boat out of Juneau’s Auke Bay with passengers and crew aboard. Officers met Coast Guard crews when they docked.“(Dupler) failed field sobriety tests offered by Juneau police,” Gifford wrote. “He was arrested, and later provided a breath sample revealing an alcohol concentration of .115.”Reached by phone Wednesday afternoon, Gifford provided a head count of the people aboard at the time of the incident.“There were 13 passengers aboard, and two crew members in addition to the captain,” Gifford said.Gifford declined to identify the tour boat’s operator, citing a decision not to do so by JPD Chief Bryce Johnson.A spokesperson for the Coast Guard, Petty Officer 3rd Class Diana Honings, confirms that 13 passengers were aboard at the time of the Coast Guard boarding. She didn’t have word about what maneuvers the boat was making at the time, but was able to identify Dupler’s company.“The Coast Guard received a tip from a crewman aboard the vessel,” Honings said. “He was working for Orca Enterprises.”Orca Enterprises’ websitesays Dupler has more than 35 years of experience as captain and chief engineer on vessels ranging from fishing boats and tugboats to diving boats and pleasure craft. The company, owned by Carol Pitts, offers three whale-watching tours daily to the coastline of Admiralty Island; ticket prices run from $59 to $119 for children or adults.“Captain Larry, an internationally renowned whale watching captain, accompanied by a professional tour guide/naturalist, bring years of knowledge and experience to your personalized excursion,” a description on the website reads. “Come with us for the whale watching and wildlife adventure of a lifetime.”A woman who answered the phone at Orca Enterprises Wednesday afternoon said nobody was available to comment on the case.Dupler is being held on $1,500 bail at the Lemon Creek Correctional Center, with any Coast Guard disciplinary measures against him or the company pending further examination.“Right now it's still under investigation, and any punishment will come after a hearing,” Honings said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Four of the six owners -- Gosuk, Sutton, Harless and Byayuk -- also held the fishing permits for their vessels.Troopers also charged three other people: Skammin permit holder Norma Ayojiak, 44, Skammin crew member Michael Poulsen, 21, and Hammer Time permit holder Will Fox, 18.Between July 16 and Wednesday troopers say seven of the defendants, everyone except Michael Poulsen and Ayojiak, entered guilty pleas and were sentenced in Dillingham District Court.AST spokesperson Megan Peters didn’t initially have estimates for the amount of cargo seized or the value of the seized vessels Wednesday afternoon. When asked about the scope of the incident, however, she noted the actions of a fellow state agency.“After we did this, the Department of Fish and Game reduced the fish opening on the 15th, because they thought the illegal fishing would affect the (fishery’s) escapement,” Peters said.Peters, who has been with AST since 2007, says she can’t remember a single case in which troopers seized six fishing vessels for illegal fishing.Troopers referred questions on the sentencing of the defendants and the magnitude of the seizures to Dillingham court officials, who weren’t able to respond by close of business at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The initiative is proposed by the Alaska Fisheries Conservation Alliance, Inc. (AFCA).A civil suit was filed by AFCA against the office of Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell, arguing the office “erred in declining to certify 13PCAF because it is a permissible regulatory measure, not an appropriation,” according to court documents. The alliance further alleges the initiative seeks to “regulate a method of take and does not allocate fish among competing users.”Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell denied the group's application in January, saying the proposal violated the Alaska Constitution.The Alaska Department of Law posited, in a January review of the initiative, that the measure would appeal to the self-interests of an electoral majority and would “significantly reduce the Legislature’s and Board of Fisheries’ control of and discretion over allocation decisions.”The decision came primarily upon answering whether the initiative would appropriate salmon, which the court concluded are an undisputed public asset. As part of its ruling, Judge Catherine Easter was asked to look at the logistics for completing two objectives: whether the initiative would prevent what Treadwell termed “give-away programs” that appeal to the self-interest of voters, and whether the initiative would endanger the state treasury’s ability to preserve “legislative discretion” by ensuring only the Legislature retains control over all state asset allocations, including natural resources like salmon.In analyzing the first objective, the court ruled against Treadwell’s position that the initiative would present a giveaway program, stating the initiative would not target any particular public asset, but would rather seek to regulate what it defined as “one of many methods and means used to take salmon,” according to the ruling. Further, it reflected the judge’s belief that the initiative would create an “abundance for all users” rather than “bestowing an asset on a person or a group.”As for preserving legislative discretion by leaving all allocation decisions to the Board of Fisheries, Easter had to consider whether the initiative “would set aside a certain specified amount of money or property for a specific purpose or object in such a manner that is executable, mandatory, and reasonably definite with no further legislative action,” according to her published decision.Treadwell objected that the initiative would reduce the Legislature’s and Board of Fisheries' control over allocation decisions, especially when it applied to stock- or region-specific salmon shortages between competing user groups. According to Treadwell, the lack of discretion and control would have displaced any previous allocation decision and/or authority to make future allocations.However, the court found the initiative would preserve the Board of Fisheries’ regulatory ability through the Legislature, “with ongoing authority to continue to control the allocation of salmon among competing users.”“(The initiative) certainly does not set aside a certain specified amount of money or property for a specific purpose in such a manner that is executable, mandatory, and reasonably definite with no further legislative action,” Easter concluded. “(The initiative) eliminates set net gear and requires the Board of Fisheries action to allocate the potential abundance of salmon.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They include Rodney Gosuk of the 5 G’s, 39; Anthony Poulsen of the Skammin, 46; Alvaro Sutton of the Kalena Annielyse, 35; Kevin Harless of the Good Deal, 52; William Byayuk of the Inuli, 22; and Leroy Fox of the Hammer Time, 54.Fish seizures ranged from 3,736 pounds aboard the Inuli to 10,193 pounds aboard the Hammer Time. Each of the owners was fined $15,000, with $3,000 of Sutton’s fine suspended. All six received jail sentences ranging from 30 to 365 days, with almost all of the time suspended; only Gosuk and Poulsen will spend time behind bars, with each ordered to serve five days.AST spokesperson Megan Peters says that while the seized vessels may be returned to their owners, the proceeds of their catch have already been forfeited.“When they pay their fine, they get their boat back,” Peters said. “The fish are dead, so they’re still processed; the funds from the fish are turned over to the state.”All of the vessels’ owners will spend three years of probation, with Gosuk and Poulsen receiving five-year probation terms.Court records list misdemeanor cases against three other people charged during the seizures, including Skammin permit holder Norma Ayojiak, Skammin crewman Michael Poulsen and Hammer Time permit holder Will Fox, as still open.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Facebook rumors that the search had been called off Wednesday were inaccurate, with the Mat-Su Borough dive team leaving but other searchers continuing their efforts.“Helo-3 is being utilized to get searchers into locations further out and difficult to access by walking,” Ipsen wrote. “Several searchers from the (National) Park Service and Fairbanks area groups will be assisting with search efforts today. The main focus of the search today is in areas of probability looking for him or any clues in the area.”Warner hasn’t been seen since Sunday morning, when he left a recreational vehicle at the Willow Creek Resort to go fishing alone, wearing waders but carrying little if any food and neither a cellphone nor any sort of weapon.Six troopers, including four Alaska Wildlife Troopers riding all-terrain vehicles and four Palmer-area Alaska State Troopers, are also participating in Thursday’s search efforts.Ipsen says searchers’ primary focus Thursday is land in the Willow Creek corridor.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The 71-year-old was last seen Sunday morning leaving a recreational vehicle at the Willow Creek Resort on a solo walk to the creek, carrying a fishing pole but neither a cellphone nor a weapon.“They’re using underwater cameras to sweep the deeper areas of the creek and pools,” Ipsen said. “They have searched the creek -- they’re just checking the deep spots now.”AST’s Helo-3 isn’t expected to return to the creek Wednesday, whereit had previously conducted overflights of the area,and all-terrain vehicles have been impeded by heavy foliage. Ipsen says some crews with search dogs are continuing to check shoreline areas for Warner.“They’re still searching the land, too,” Ipsen said. “Because of the vegetation, it’s hard to do an aerial search of the land.”According to Ipsen, Wednesday’s work hasn’t been classified as either a search or a recovery operation.“It’s still considered both,” Ipsen said. “The biggest part of the search, and what’s going to get results, are the people on the land and the water.”Ipsen dismissed Facebook rumors Wednesday afternoon that the search for Warner had been called off, confirming that Mat-Su Borough divers had been released from the scene after conducting a thorough underwater search of the area.Several other agencies remain involved with the search, and Ipsen says a member of the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group is heading up the interagency management team overseeing operations.“There are still a lot of volunteers,” Ipsen said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Warner was last seen at the Willow Creek Resort Sunday morning departing his recreational vehicle, carrying a fishing pole without a weapon, cellphone or much food.Although the search itself is a ground effort, many means of transport are helping search teams reach the backcountry. AST’s Helo-3 is flying teams into more remote areas, with Alaska Railroad hybrid-drive SUVs capable of riding railroad tracks also seeing service and volunteers with the Mat-Su search-and-rescue group MATSAR bringing their own means of transportation.“There’s actually people with horses involved,” Ipsen said. “We’ve really been fortunate to have a lot of resources -- we’ve had search dogs come down from Fairbanks.”Ipsen credits the interagency management team running the Warner search with bringing so many entities into play, as well as maintaining overall interest and volunteer levels in the field.“There have been as many as 46 people involved with the search,” Ipsen said.No sign of Warner has been found in the search as of Friday morning, Ipsen said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Troy Shuey said Helo-3 made a slow visual sweep over the river early Monday but saw no sign of Warner. The helicopter's crew reported the water to be fairly clear in most areas and running normal to low. Another sweep was conducted in the afternoon without any luck.In an email to Channel 2 Sunday evening, AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen said numerous teams were searching for Warner.“We have a trooper on scene as well as searchers on foot and a Mat-Su Borough boat looking for (Warner),” Ipsen wrote. “He was last seen 12 hours ago headed out on foot with a fishing pole and waders to go fishing by himself.”Theresa Dean at the Willow Creek Resort said troopers briefly suspended their search overnight Sunday but resumed efforts Monday.“They were here until midnight doing everything they could,” Dean said. “They started again at about 5 a.m. They have dogs, and (were) getting equipment together and staging.”The plan was the same Monday night heading into Tuesday, according to a trooper on scene.In comments onChannel 2’s Facebook page,Meghan Dean posted a photo of Warner, confirmed by Ipsen to be in use during the search. She said Warner was last seen wearing a camouflage baseball cap, gray chest waders and a gray-and-black heavy waterproof jacket. He was carrying a walking stick.“His plan was to go upstream from the Willow bridge looking for trout,” Meghan Dean wrote. “We are all tired up here from helping and we are using every avenue to reach out to people.”Ipsen said search operations paused at about midnight, formally resuming with expanded search assets at about 5:30 a.m.According to a Mat-Su Borough statement, Nathan Graber with Willow Fire and Rescue, the incident commander for the search, estimates that more than 40 people are currently participating in the search for Warner."Graber reports that five boats are searching Willow Creek, focusing on the downstream today," borough officials wrote. "He said up to eight search dogs from MATSAR, a local nonprofit search and rescue group, are working different areas. MATSAR also brought in ATVs for a ground search. Willow EMS is also searching."Gary Klink, the Mat-Su Borough's chief of water rescue, says the search area is as difficult to traverse as it is to reach.“It’s tough walking,” Klink said in the borough statement. “It’s typical Alaska terrain -- trees, brush, devil’s club, dense woods.”Information from the scene, relayed to Ipsen by a trooper going off-duty after a 20-hour shift on the search, suggests Warner has minimal survival gear.“He didn’t take anything else besides the fishing pole -- no phone, no weapons, not much food if any,” Ipsen said. “He was only supposed to go out for a few hours; he definitely wasn’t supposed to be out that long.”Ipsen says troopers are hoping that Warner, who is visiting the state with his girlfriend in their recreational vehicle, simply got lost.“He’s an experienced fisherman, he’s an experienced outdoorsman,” Ipsen said. “It’s not clear how much experience he has in Alaska.”A Monday AST dispatch on the search says Warner frequently goes fishing alone. The couple's RV was parking at the resort."So far, no one has found any sign of Warner," troopers wrote.Shuey, the trooper at the scene, says canine units are still working the river area. There has been light rain since Sunday night, which isn't expected to seriously affect dogs' abilities to find a scent unless it persists or increases. According to what Warner told his girlfriend, he was headed across the river and upstream.Anyone with information on Warner’s whereabouts should call troopers at 907-352-5401.Editor's note: An initial reference by Alaska State Troopers to Jerry Warner's female companion as his wife has been revised in subsequent reports.Channel 2’s Austin Baird, Sarah Evans and Mallory Peebles contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The boat had left Whittier Sunday morning on a two-day fishing trip to the Perry Island area, with the Coast Guard conducting search operations Tuesday.“They’re actually in a spot that doesn’t have any VHF radio coverage -- they couldn’t hear us, we couldn’t hear them,” Swinghamer said. “There also wasn’t any cellphone coverage.”Swinghamer says the men are awaiting the arrival of the cutter Long Island for assistance in proceeding to Whittier.No email address was supplied by.

According to its reports, large gold, copper and molybdenum mining would require excavation of the “largest open pit ever constructed in North America,” according to the report.The report states the pit would cover nearly seven square miles at a maximum depth of over three-quarters of a mile.For now, the fate of Bristol Bay and the proposed mines continues to hang in the balance. In May, the Pebble Partnership sued the EPA, seeking an injunction to stop the agency’s process to preemptively veto the Pebble Project under 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.  The stipulation authorizes EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the discharge of dredged or fill material as defined sites in waters whenever it determines use of such sites for disposal would have adverse affects on one or more various resource, including fisheries and wildlife.The state of Alaska has sided with mine supporters in the past, while Alaska Native groups have sided with the EPA.Pebble Partnership has lost the backing of two of its majority investors, most recently British and Australian mining company Rio Tinto. In December 2013 global mining corporation Anglo American withdrew its investments from the project as well.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Members point to harvest reports that show many people, especially in the middle river, feel their subsistence needs have not been met.“To usurp those reds and chums with a commercial opening at the lower part of the river, to the detriment to the people in the middle river and the headwaters, is very unfair for subsistence harvesters,” said working group member Mary Sattler.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says the decision to open the river to commercial fishermen is based on a surplus of chums, as well as indications that people are waiting to target silver salmon.“There is a harvestable surplus that we've identified this year so far. We are seeing reasonable numbers at our escapement projects,” said Aaron Poetter, Fish and Game's Kuskokwim area management biologist.A special action limiting subsistence harvest of Chinook on the river to federally qualified users expired at midnight Friday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, no sign of Jerry Warner or his gear had been found.“This is a team that is made up of highly trained volunteers,” Ipsen said. “These guys are kind of running the show.”Warner reportedly left the recreational vehicle in which he and his girlfriend were camping at the Willow Creek Resort Sunday on a solo fishing trip, reportedly wearing a camouflage baseball cap, gray chest waders and a gray-and-black heavy waterproof jacket.While Warner was carrying a fishing pole and a walking stick, troopers say he didn’t have a cellphone or weapons, and had been carrying little or no food.AST’s Helo-3 conducted several overflights of the creek near the resort Monday, with MATSAR volunteers deploying at least eight dog teams in the area. The Mat-Su Borough lent boats to the search effort as well, with at least 40 people helping to look for Warner.Ipsen says that Tuesday’s work involves crews deploying a variety of assets on and over the creek, for a more intensive search.“They've got Helo-3 out there, they've got divers, they've got boats floating down the river,” Ipsen said. “They're trying to figure out a way to check the deeper areas out there.”Anyone with information on Warner’s whereabouts should call troopers at 907-352-5401.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Bieber's hit tune "Baby.""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke," Vorozhbitsyn told the Daily Mail.A bear expert said it wasn't Bieber's music that the bear found offensive, adding the animal was likely scared off by the sudden, loud noise.Still, we're willing to bet this fisherman is now a "Belieber" for life.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

For women, this can be especially true after menopause, when body fat tends to shift to the abdomen.Yet an increase in belly fat can do more than make it hard to zip up your jeans. Research shows that belly fat also carries serious health risks. The good news? The threats posed by belly fat can be cut down to size.Your weight is largely determined by how you balance the calories you eat with the energy you burn. If you eat too much and exercise too little, you're likely to pack on excess pounds — including belly fat.However, aging also plays a role. Muscle mass typically diminishes with age, while fat increases. Loss of muscle mass also decreases the rate at which your body uses calories, which can make it more challenging to maintain a healthy weight.Many women also notice an increase in belly fat as they get older — even if they aren't gaining weight. This is likely due to a decreasing level of estrogen, which appears to influence where fat is distributed in the body.The tendency to gain or carry weight around the waist — have an "apple" rather than a "pear" shape — might have a genetic component as well.The trouble with belly fat is that it's not limited to the extra layer of padding located just below the skin (subcutaneous fat). It also includes visceral fat — which lies deep inside your abdomen, surrounding your internal organs.Although subcutaneous fat poses cosmetic concerns, visceral fat is linked with far more dangerous health problems, including:Research also has associated belly fat with an increased risk of premature death — regardless of overall weight. In fact, some studies have found that even when women were considered a normal weight based on standard body mass index (BMI) measurements, a large waistline increased the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease.So how do you know if you have too much belly fat? Simply measure your waist:For women, a waist measurement of 35 inches (89 centimeters) or more indicates an unhealthy concentration of belly fat and a greater risk of problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. For men, a waist measurement of 40 inches (102 centimeters) or more is considered cause for concern.You can tone abdominal muscles with crunches or other targeted abdominal exercises, but just doing these exercises won't get rid of belly fat. However, visceral fat does respond to the same diet and exercise strategies that can help you shed excess pounds and lower your total body fat. To battle the bulge:To lose excess fat and keep it from coming back, aim for slow and steady weight loss — up to 2 pounds (1 kilogram) a week. Consult your doctor for help getting started and staying on track.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/womens-health/in-depth/belly-fat/art-20045809/No email address was supplied by.

Alaska debates proposal to raise minimum wageAlaskans will soon decide if the state's minimum wage is due for an increase.While the $7.75 per hour minimum wage is already 50 cents higher than the federal floor, Ballot Measure 3 would boost the minimum to $8.75 next year and $9.75 in 2016.A public hearing Tuesday at the Dena'ina Center gave a platform for people on each side of the debate to voice their opinions.Vince O'Shea, vice president of Pacific Seafood Processors Association, said the current minimum wage should remain due to the availability of cheaper fish in the global market."We compete in a global market and Alaska supplies only a fraction of the global supply of seafood," O'Shea said. "So the people we sell to, if we raise our prices they have many choices of where to go elsewhere."Rev. Micheal Burke of St Mary's Episcopal Church said it is important to think about the quality of life of those working a low-wage job."To work 70 hours a week and juggle school on top of that, with two young kids at home is almost impossible to do," Burke said. "We need to create enough breathing room, enough of a level playing field, that hard work pays again."Eight public hearings are scheduled, the next coming Thursday in the Valley at Menard Memorial Sports Center at 4 p.m.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). “It's causing confusion with our good, sustainably managed fishery and a fish that is of high quality.”The Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers asked the FDA on Sept. 3 to make the name change.“So we’ve come together as a delegation to ask for action on this,” Murkowski said.Sen. Mark Begich said Russia is capitalizing from the confusion.“What we're seeing now is Russia, for example, trying to steal the name and put it on their product, because they know we run a sustainable, high-quality product that I think in a lot of ways Russia would like to take advantage of,” Begich said. “That’s why we as a delegation have petitioned the FDA to make it very clear.

Find out why here.<COL>iStock/WoodcreeperFall is one of the best times of the year to go bass fishing.Fishermen are able to have success fishing for bass in the fall because the colder water temperatures cause the bass to swim together in schools, make them more active, and leave the bass looking to eat anything in the water.To get the most success out of fishing in the fall, make sure you know the temperature of the water before you set out.Also check to see which plants and bugs are natural to that body of water to help you correctly choose your bait to match.Knowing where the deep water is near the shallow water can also be helpful in successfully finding the bass. This time of year, the shallow water is more likely to be at a colder temperature than the deeper water.No email address was supplied by.

Travis Finkenbinder, 41, was operating the skiff when he was struck by the floatplane, piloted by 34-year-old Benjamin Hancock of Anchorage. Finkenbinder was critically injured in the collision, while Hancock was unhurt; the airplane sustained minor damage.Hancock and Finkenbinder were part of a group including two Beavers, two 18-foot skiffs and their operators when the incident occurred. The group was working together to shuttle equipment aboard the skiffs from one fish camp along the river to Ekwok, according to the NTSB report; the Beavers were being used to ferry the skiffs.NTSB investigators interviewed Hancock, who stated Finkenbinder started the boat’s motor and headed downriver. Hancock watched Finkenbinder before taking off in the airplane behind him.“The pilot said that he kept the boat operator in sight, but then the airplane encountered a downdraft or other wind condition, and the airplane sank,” NTSB officials wrote in the report. “The pilot said when he pulled the airplane's nose back to compensate for the sink he lost sight of the boat operator.”It was then that Hancock reported he heard a noise and knew something had happened. According to the report, Hancock “radioed the other pilot (who had not yet departed), turned his airplane around and saw that the boat was circling to the left in the river, and the operator appeared unconscious.”Hancock landed in the water and taxied to put his plane in a position where it could potentially stop the runaway boat, according to the report. The boat then collided with the airplane, went up over the float and struck the propeller.“(Hancock) exited the airplane to help the boat operator, who was subsequently flown to an ambulance by the other pilot in the other airplane,” NTSB officials wrote. “According to company maintenance personnel, all of the damage to the airplane was sustained during the post-landing collision with the boat.”Both Hancock and Finkenbinder are employees of McKinley Capital Management’s flight department. The company’s flight department is known for taking clients and employees to remote areas to fish and to a company-owned lodge on Lake Clark.The company’s senior vice president J.L. McCarrey characterized his team of operators as a “pretty close-knit family.” He described Hancock and Finkenbinder as “very experienced pilots” and longtime McKinley employees.Finkenbinder was initially flown to King Salmon for medical attention, and was subsequently medevaced in critical condition to Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage. Providence spokesperson Ginger Houghton says he is still recovering at the hospital and listed in serious condition as of Tuesday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Thursday marks the opening of dipnetting in the area -- but there are closures on roads and boat launches to know about before heading out.Kenai’s boat launch is closing during most low tides for the first week of the season, while Beaver Loop Road is closed for culvert construction and the old Cannery Road entrance to South Beach is also closed. City officials say the season is expected to be good while it's open.It can be tough to know what to expect when you’re dip netting for sockeyes. That's especially true for Paul Wood.“Never gone dip netting before,” Wood said. “And I heard there was (an) opening, so I thought we'd give it a try and drive down.”This year, even a seasoned dip netter might be caught off guard.Tide tables have been posted at the Kenai boat launch -- and anyone fishing should read them before leaving, because when it gets below 1 foot the launch lanes will close.“When we get down around zero (feet) there's no concrete planks yet, and cars and just vehicles will just be on the mud,” said City Manager Rick Koch. “And we found that that doesn't work very well, and we have to tow them out then.”People fishing on the shore could also run into a sticky situation when the tides go the opposite direction.“You're going to be left to how high the tide eventually comes,” Koch said. “Every year cars go underwater; I'm sure this year will be no different, unfortunately.”The Alaska Department of Fish of Game wants dipnetters to be sure they're also reading the regulation book. In addition to rules and maps, there are pictures that help show the difference between a pink and a king salmon.Keeping a king during the current emergency order could result in a fine costing more than $100. When those reds come in, however, can be tough to predict.“I'm hoping to get more experience on fishing, so when I grow older I can have plenty of time dip netting with my friends,” said fisherman Kyle Degraw.Locals say the weather, which has been pretty chilly, windy and rainy, has kept opening-day numbers down.This weekend crowds are expected to pick up, but Fish and Game officials say it could be after the weekend when the salmon hit their high numbers.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The document depicts a night of drinking a “12-pack of Budweiser and an unknown bottle of vodka” between the female and Neketa at a mutual friend’s home.The victim states in the document she consumed approximately four beers and consumed several shots of the vodka over the course of the evening. As the night progressed, the victim alleges she became tired and wanted to sleep, so she walked into a bedroom and fell asleep, according to the document.“(The victim) said the next thing she knew, she heard someone yelling which caused her to wake up and that was when she realized Neketa was on top of her,” investigators wrote in the document.The victim’s pants had been removed, according to the documents, and she was telling Neketa to stop, “but he continued until (the mutual friend) pulled him away from her.” Neketa then left the residence.Investigators conducted interviews with the friend, the victim and another woman who witnessed the act, all corroborating a similar story. Troopers were also present during the interviews prior to a sexual assault response team examination.Neketa was arrested that evening and remanded to the King Salmon Jail the next day. On July 9 investigators interviewed Neketa from his cell where said he had blacked out on the night of the incident and did not remember anything, according to the document.Neketa will appear in the Naknek Courthouse July 18 for his per-indictment hearing.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

She and her husband are in Alaska on a fishing trip and stopped by the festival for some fun.The celebration was also a chance for families to get together. The most exciting part of the festival was where kids got a chance to learn to kayak, pop bubbles or get a summer inspried hairdo. Paparazzi Kids used colorful hair woven into natural hair to make creative dos that Styleist Kenyada Waters said are inspired by the long days."These colors are definitely bright and vibrant and bring about life and just fun!" Waters said.Many children and adults also had elaborate facepaint. What was more exciting to kids like Donovan Brown, age 9 was jumping on a trampoline while harnessed into bungee cords."It was so fun, man!" he said. Brown said jumping and flipping in the air made it worth the long line it took to get to the fun.For the crowd older than the age of 9, the food was a big attraction. Kettle Corn Cooked in the street while several vendors posted "sold out" signs as the evening wound down.Jody Thompson served up some smoked salmon cakes to customers at the Fishalicious booth. She said that the gloomy weather earlier in the day didn't put a damper on her business."It's been great, a really good turnout considering it was stormig earlier. It's been a good day, fun solstice," Didema Daugherty said as the festival was nearing it's end at 6 p.m. The fun doesn't have to stop.

The opening comes with an increase to daily bag limits as well. Beginning at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday daily limits increase to six sockeye salmon and the possession limit increases to 12 sockeye in the Russian River and a section of the mainstem Upper Kenai River.Waters are open to sports fishing from the Russian River Sanctuary, including those upstream from markers located just downstream of the ferry crossing on the Kenai River to markers located approximately 300 yards upstream of the boat launch at Sportsman’s Landing. Waters from the Russian River mouth remains open as well.From the Kenai River upstream from Skilak Lake to the Sportsman’s Landing, including the upstream end of the island near the Russian River mouth, bag limits will increase for salmon, other than king salmon, 16 inches or greater in length to six fish per day, and 12 in possession. Of those fish only one per day and in possession may be a coho salmon, according to ADF&G officials.As of Monday, June 23, more than 26,000 sockeye had been counted passing the Russian River weir, according to DFG officials, prompting the announcement. Based on early and average run-timing, ADF&G officials are expecting biological escapement goals to exceed the July 14 projection.

McCarrey. “We’re concerned for the welfare of our family.”WHAT WENT WRONG?At the time of the incident, the men were part of a group shuttling equipment from one fish camp to another, according to Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Beth Ipsen. The Beaver piloted by Hancock and another identical aircraft were being used to ferry the skiffs around.“One of the Beavers on floats was taking off, and it hit a downdraft and it hit Travis in the head,” Ipsen said. “The pilot realized he hit something, landed, and saw the skiff basically turning in circles.”Hancock taxied and stopped the boat with one of his floats.Another aircraft in the group landed to assist and started transporting Finkenbinder to King Salmon to receive medical attention. Ipsen said he was later medevaced to Providence Alaska Medical Center.Friday at 11 a.m., Finkenbinder was listed in critical at Providence, according to spokesperson Ginger Houghton.According to Ipsen, the Beaver’s pilot has been devastated by Wednesday’s events.“These guys are friends -- they work together, so as you can imagine it’s very upsetting,” Ipsen said.McCarrey described both men as "very experienced pilots" and longtime McKinley employees.Troopers were first informed of Finkenbinder’s injuries by the Bristol Bay Police Department around 6:15 p.m. Wednesday.Officers from that department alerted the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.

That amount was 20 percent of what the state spent defending itself in the fisheries management lawsuit, according to a Department of Law memo filed with the court June 18.The Cook Inlet Fishermen's Fund, or CIFF, sued the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in July 2013, asserting that fisheries managers did not follow Cook Inlet salmon management plans appropriately that year and caused harm to commercial fishermen. Guidi denied a preliminary injunction that summer.After hearing oral argument May 29, Guidi granted the state's motion for summary judgment June 2. He wrote in his final decision that there was no evidence that ADFG had "exceeded its authority in executing the emergency plan promulgated by the Alaska Board of Fisheries. Specifically, the Fund has failed to articulate any concrete way in which the Department overstepped its management authority other than the claim - already rejected on motion for preliminary injunction - that the Fund's fishermen were entitled to 51 hours of extra fishing time by law."CIFF has appealed the suit to the Alaska Supreme Court. Now, the record in the case must be prepared and a transcript of the proceedings provided to the court before CIFF can file its opening brief in the appeal.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

However, it has heard some concerns from businesses, mainly about potential added costs to employers, should Ballot Measure 2 pass."The business community feels an overall risk in costs associated with this and that's really the basis of their concern," Halcro said.A possible hike in insurance costs and the implementation of drug screening programs were a couple of the examples brought up during the debate.Taylor Bickford, a representative for the Yes on 2 campaign, told those attending that passing the measure would be a beneficial business opportunity for Alaska. He pointed to the tax windfall seen by state governments in Washington and Colorado from legal weed as a sign of things to come."What we're seeing in these other states is that jobs are being created, economic development that was benefiting criminals is now benefiting businesses and tax revenue is being collected," Bickford said.The No on 2 campaign claims the measure is about big Outside businesses trying to make money off Alaskans. Kristina Woolston says legalization may impair the employees who make up Alaska's workforce in industries such as fishing, saying legalization would lead to increased marijuana use."We rely on thousands and thousands of employees from all around the world to be safe, to be aware, to be responsible," Woolston said.

He says concerns about pollution from its sinking are limited.“From the reports we have of the amount of fuel on board, we’re just monitoring at this point,” Parker said.In another call, the three people aboard a 19-foot vessel near Blackstone Bay reported that they were taking on water, calling watchstanders for assistance.“The operator was able to beach the vessel to prevent it from sinking,” officials wrote. “A good Samaritan overheard the initial call, responded and assisted in securing the vessel before transporting all three boaters to Whittier.”Three people in another vessel which began to take on water, the Poker Dogs, reported that they were in trouble near Port Wells.“A good Samaritan nearby responded to the captain’s request for assistance and safely escorted the vessel back to Whittier,” officials wrote.In the Southeast Alaska case, the 26-foot fishing vessel Oracle had two people on board when it was disabled by an overheated engine. The crew called Juneau watchstanders, who kept in contact with them until help arrived.“Good Samaritans aboard the fishing vessel Crista C responded and towed the Oracle safely to Haines,” officials wrote.According to Lt. j.g. Victoria Swinghamer, an Anchorage watchstander, Tuesday’s rescues are a demonstration of how Alaska’s boating community keeps an eye out for those in distress.“We encourage boaters to safely help one another in emergencies, but it's even more important for boaters to help themselves by boating safe and planning ahead,” Swinghamer said in the statement.Parker says that while the four rescues all have disparate circumstances, they all offer a common lesson for boaters.“Always be prepared -- accidents can happen at a moment’s notice,” Parker said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Making a few lifestyle changes can help you control your cholesterol and increase the effectiveness of medication.<COL>iStock / STEEXByMayo Clinic News NetworkHigh cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and heart attacks. You can reduce cholesterol with medications, but if you'd rather make lifestyle changes to reduce cholesterol, you can try these five healthy lifestyle changes. If you're already taking medications, these changes can also improve their cholesterol-lowering effect.Carrying some extra pounds — even just a few — contributes to high cholesterol. Losing as little as 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can help significantly reduce cholesterol levels.Start by taking an honest, thorough look at your eating habits and daily routine. Consider your challenges to weight loss and ways to overcome them.If you eat when you're bored or frustrated, take a walk instead. If you pick up fast food for lunch every day, pack something healthier from home. If you're sitting in front of the television, try munching on carrot sticks instead of potato chips as you watch. Take time and enjoy rather than "devouring" your food. Don't eat mindlessly.And look for ways to incorporate more activity into your daily routine, such as using the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Take stock of what you currently eat and your physical activity level and slowly work in changes.Even if you have years of unhealthy eating under your belt, making a few changes in your diet can reduce cholesterol and improve your heart health.Whether you're overweight or not, exercise can reduce cholesterol. Better yet, moderate physical activity can help raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol. With your doctor's OK, work up to at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. Remember that adding physical activity, even in 10-minute intervals several times a day, can help you begin to lose weight. Just be sure that you can keep up the changes you decide to make. Consider:To stay motivated, find an exercise buddy or join an exercise group. And remember, any activity is helpful. Even taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing a few situps while watching television can make a difference.If you smoke, stop. Quitting may improve your HDL cholesterol level. And the benefits don't end there. Just 20 minutes after quitting, your blood pressure decreases. Within 24 hours, your risk of a heart attack decreases. Within one year, your risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker. Within 15 years, your risk of heart disease is similar to someone who never smoked.Moderate use of alcohol has been linked with higher levels of HDL cholesterol — but the benefits aren't strong enough to recommend alcohol for anyone who doesn't already drink. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart failure and stroke.Sometimes healthy lifestyle changes aren't enough to lower cholesterol levels. Make sure the changes you choose to make are ones that you can continue, and don't be disappointed if you don't see results immediately. If your doctor recommends medication to help lower your cholesterol, take it as prescribed, but continue your lifestyle changes.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/reduce-cholesterol/art-20045935No email address was supplied by.

The department says so far, it has only counted about 63 fish.“We think the fish are just holding the lower river with low water conditions right now,” said Fish and Game biologist Samantha Oslund. “We really don't know how many fish in the rivers, so we need to close the fishery and let some of them come up.”On Kodiak Island, the Ayakulik and Karluk rivers are also seeing closures to fishing for kings effective Saturday. Fish and Game says the rivers have seen 350 and 250 kings counted toward their respective escapement goals of 3,000 to 6,000 and 4,000 to 7,000 fish.While the Little Su is off-limits for keeping kings, Fish and Game says it sees good number of them on both the Deshka River and Ship Creek. The department also points out that many areas have great numbers for red salmon."The Kenai Peninsula is flooded with sockeye right now; the Russian River is great, Klutina is great, and the whole Copper River,” Ryan said. “In fact, Fish and Game just upped the bag and possession limit for sockeye on the Copper River drainage.”Alaska State Troopers say you could face at least $250 in fines for being in possession of a king salmon in waters where it's illegal to fish them.Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

When they arrived, rescuers had the four people on board rope themselves together then walk across a log to one of the waiting boats.“The wildlife trooper said 10 more minutes and they would have been testing out their life jackets,” Ipsen said.While all four occupants refused medical attention, Ipsen says the boat subsequently drifted beneath the log jam and sank, where it remains completely submerged Friday evening.“The boat was secured and left at the scene for later recovery by the owner,” troopers wrote.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It was last seen by the crew of another vessel in the area, drifting out to sea.“They also borrowed the boat,” Downing said. “It wasn't their boat.”Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 1st Class Shawn Eggert couldn’t verify details of the account, because the incident apparently wasn’t reported to the Coast Guard Monday.Channel 2’s Reba Lean and Tracy Sabo contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Troopers arrived to find Long tangled in a partially deployed fishing net, according to Troopers.With the assistance of the Hooper Bay VPSO and emergency personnel, crews were able to remove Long from the waters. Resuscitation measures were taken at the scene, and continued at the Hooper Bay clinic without success, Troopers said. Long would be pronounced deceased around 3 a.m., according to Troopers.Troopers note Long was not wearing a personal flotation device at the time of the accident.Though there was no sign of foul play and it appears alcohol did not play a factor in the accident, Troopers will continue to investigate the events that led up to Long’s apparent drowning.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

After hearing oral argument May 29, Anchorage Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi granted the state's motion for summary judgment on June 2. He wrote in his final decision that there was no evidence that ADFG had "exceeded its authority in executing the emergency plan promulgated by the Alaska Board of Fisheries. Specifically, the Fund has failed to articulate any concrete way in which the Department overstepped its management authority other than the claim - already rejected on motion for preliminary injunction - that the Fund's fishermen were entitled to 51 hours of extra fishing time by law."Weyhrauch listed seven points of appeal in the Supreme Court filing, asserting that the court erred at each step of the way, including when it granted ADFG's motion for summary judgment and denied CIFF's request for injunctive relief, constitutional claims, tort claims and discovery.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Fire and rescue crews responded just after 3 a.m."He was at about Mile 4 at the Williwaw daily use salmon viewing areas where he had parked," Kempton said. "So that was the point that we accessed him from."The man set out on his hike around 4 p.m. Saturday, according to Kempton, and was climbing alone in an area with steep inclines and ravines. The Alaska Mountain Rescue Group, after making voice contact with him, was able to harness him in to a rope system, and help him down."He was in an area with no trail," Kempton said. "That was the problem, he came down in an area that was untraveled y people, so it was just essentially a scramble through the brush and devil's club all the way up to to get to him."Kempton says the young man was examined on the scene and released, but that the incident could have been much worse, and recommends traveling with at least one other person when hiking."Having a group to travel with, especially someone who is familiar with the area, is good," Kempton said. "We want to see people who are well equipped and in good health, and are familiar with the area they are hiking, and have a good plan. Make sure someone knows where you're going, so that if you don't come back on time, they're able to have a pretty good idea [for responders]."KTUU's Samanatha Angaiak contributed to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

A number of villages participated by telephone, along with representatives from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the federal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages fishing on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.One restriction for subsistence fishing is the use of 4-inch gill nets that are 60 feet long or less. Many people expressed concerns with the 4 inch gill-nets are not working well. There are also restrictions for gear but set nets are still allowed.Almost everyone who commented said the number of king salmon being caught is is quite low amid an array of state and federal fishing restrictions, which have led to concerns about lack of food for the winter.“We are of course trying to save the king salmon for our next generations, but for weeks and weeks of restrictions there's going to be consequences,” said subsistence fisherman Fritz Charles. “I've heard from quite a few villages as well that they're setting out with rifles and shotguns.”Violating the restrictions could result in jail time and fines. The chair of the meeting asked people attending to keep calm and spread that message to those not present.USFWS officials say there's a chance they might soon change the gill net restriction from 4 inches to 6 inches. Many people said during the meeting that 6-inch gill nets are much more favorable for catching fish.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Although diet is the best way to get calcium, calcium supplements may be an option if your diet falls short.Before you consider calcium supplements, be sure you understand how much calcium you need, the pros and cons of calcium supplements, and which type of supplement to choose.Your body needs calcium to build and maintain strong bones. Your heart, muscles and nerves also need calcium to function properly.Some studies suggest that calcium, along with vitamin D, may have benefits beyond bone health, perhaps protecting against cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. But evidence about such health benefits is not definitive.If you don't get enough calcium, you could face health problems related to weak bones:Many Americans don't get enough calcium in their diets. Children and adolescent girls are at particular risk, but so are adults age 50 and older.How much calcium you need depends on your age and sex. Note that the upper limit in the chart represents the safe boundary — it's not how much you should aim to get. If you exceed the upper limit, you may increase your risk of health problems related to excessive calcium.Your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium. For this reason, some calcium supplements contain vitamin D. A few foods naturally contain small amounts of vitamin D, such as canned salmon with bones, and egg yolks. You can also get vitamin D from fortified foods and sun exposure. The RDA for vitamin D is 600 international units (15 micrograms) a day for most adults.Your body doesn't produce calcium, so you must get it through other sources. Calcium can be found in a variety of foods, including:Even if you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you may find it difficult to get enough calcium if you:In these situations, calcium supplements may help you meet your calcium requirements.Several different kinds of calcium compounds are used in calcium supplements. Each compound contains varying amounts of the mineral calcium — referred to as elemental calcium. Common calcium supplements may be labeled as:The two main forms of calcium supplements are carbonate and citrate. Calcium carbonate is cheapest and therefore often a good first choice. Other forms of calcium in supplements include gluconate and lactate.No email address was supplied by.

However, be sure to ask your doctor about any alternative treatment you're considering. It's also important to still have on hand proven treatments to rapidly reverse severe allergic reactions, such as epinephrine injections.Here are some alternative treatments that may play a role in controlling food allergies:A Chinese herbal supplement called FAHF-2 has been shown to stop anaphylaxis -- a life-threatening allergic reaction -- caused by peanuts, eggs and fish. However, it's still being tested in larger populations. Also, many herbal supplements aren't evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may contain active ingredients that can cause unexpected side effects.Acupuncture needles are FDA approved as a medical device, and some people have reported a reduction in allergic reactions after acupuncture treatment. However, no published studies formally investigating the use of acupuncture for food allergies have been identified.Allergic reactions are essentially immune responses to food, and certain nutrients, such as antioxidants, probiotics and folic acid, have known effects on immune function. Some surveys suggest that supplementing your diet with vitamins A, D and E and zinc may help control food allergies. However, no rigorous studies on the effects of nutrition on food allergies have been conducted, and the FDA doesn't evaluate most dietary supplements.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/expert-answers/effective-alternative-treatments-food-allergies/faq-20096127/No email address was supplied by.

Some of this is early deficiency and not associated with symptoms. Once symptoms develop, they are sometimes overlooked because they develop slowly and are similar to many other problems related to growing older. It pays to be alert to symptoms and consider taking a vitamin B-12 supplement or eating food fortified with vitamin B-12. Vitamin B-12 is one of the few vitaminsMayo Clinicexperts routinely recommend for older adults.Vitamin B-12 plays a role in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function and bone health. The primary natural sources of vitamin B-12 are meats, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk; it is not found naturally in plant products. Some foods such as breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B-12. It is stored in large quantities in the liver and recirculated in the body, so even if you suddenly stopped getting vitamin B-12, it would likely take years for deficiency to develop.Deficiency can occasionally occur due to a diet that contains very little vitamin B-12, such as with strict, long-term vegans (vegetarians who consume no animal products at all) and people who are malnourished, such as some who abuse alcohol. However, it most commonly develops because the body isn’t properly digesting and absorbing vitamin B-12 due to causes that include:Aging— With age, the ability to absorb vitamin B-12 often diminishes. Inadequate nutrition and higher risk of digestive diseases also may be an issue.Diseases that affect digestion— The most common of these is pernicious anemia, in which your own immune system destroys a protein that enables you to absorb B-12. Celiac disease and Crohn’s disease also can interfere with proper vitamin B-12 absorption, as can gastric bypass surgery.Prolonged use of certain medications— Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole and H-2 blockers, which reduce stomach acid to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stomach problems, can interfere with vitamin B-12 absorption. The diabetes drug metformin also is associated with lower vitamin B-12 levels.Symptoms of B-12 deficiency can be subtle at first. Early symptoms may include a persistent tingling or prickly feeling in your feet or hands, weakness, numbness, imbalance, and mental problems such as confusion, depression, irritability and forgetfulness. Rarely, vitamin B-12 deficiency is a cause of dementia.As vitamin B-12 deficiency becomes more advanced, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) or even white blood cells and platelets may develop. Deficiency often is caught before it reaches this level.Diagnosis of vitamin B-12 deficiency typically involves blood tests. Testing for anemia may be one of them, but just because you’re not anemic doesn’t mean you’re not vitamin B-12 deficient. If vitamin B-12 deficiency is diagnosed, additional testing is sometimes performed to look for an underlying cause.For those who are deficient, raising vitamin B-12 to adequate levels may first involve correcting or treating an underlying problem, if possible. People with severe deficiency or who have an underlying problem in which the body poorly absorbs vitamin B-12 may need injections of high-dose vitamin B-12. These injections may be given several times a week at first, reduced to weekly injections, and then monthly injections if the underlying cause can’t be corrected.Taking high-dose oral vitamin B-12 may sometimes be an alternative to injections; however, it may be better used as long-term maintenance therapy after vitamin B-12 levels have been stabilized.The body responds rapidly to high-dose vitamin B-12, with nerve symptoms subsiding over weeks to months. However, the degree of improvement of nerve problems is typically influenced by how severe and long lasting the nerve problems were before treatment. In advanced cases, nerve problems can be irreversible.If you eat meat or eat breakfast cereal fortified with vitamin B-12, you’re likely getting the recommended daily intake of 2.4 micrograms (mcg). However, older adults may not be absorbing this B-12 efficiently and may want to take a daily supplement to prevent deficiency. You can’t overdose on vitamin B-12, as it’s not toxic. If you have a disease or take a drug that increases risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency or eat a strict vegan diet, talk to your doctor about appropriate supplementation levels or screening for deficiency.—Donald Hensrud, M.D., Preventive Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.Source:http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tuesday-q-a-vitamin-b-12-deficiency-more-common-with-increasing-age/No email address was supplied by.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has worked in partnership with villages on the Kuskokwim for well over a decade to operate weirs on the Kwethluk and Tuluksak Rivers. Currently there is no contract and instillation has been delayed.“Normally the Kwethluk weir is in by now, so it has delayed our process because we are still undergoing negotiations, you might say,” said USFWS fisheries biologist Steve Miller.Leaders in the villages of Kwethluk, Tuluksak, Akiak and Akiachak say they won't support weirs, tents for scientists or sport fishing on the river unless they're given a chance to fish for king salmon early this month. Right now restrictions are in place to prevent kings from being caught.“We have gone along with the closures with no questions asked, but this year the villages were unhappy for not being allowed to fish for our salmon, said John Andrew with the Kwethluk IRA Council.The Fish and Wildlife Service says it's still in negotiations, but the weirs will be counting by June 24. The Kwethluk IRA Council says as long as there are restrictions they won't support the operation.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

He and the skipper were the only two people aboard the Matt-Michelle.According to Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 1st Class Shawn Eggert, initial information about the incident logged in Coast Guard reports which stated that the Matt-Michelle's skipper jumped into the water wearing a survival suit, rescued Dushkin and brought him ashore had changed upon closer investigation Monday."When (the skipper) was all suited up, he spotted the man who by this time had washed up on shore," Eggert said. "So he swam ashore and tried to do CPR on (Dushkin)."After receiving a distress call, the good Samaritan fishing vessel Miss Roxanne arrived at the scene to render assistance."The Miss Roxanne sent a crew member ashore with a defibrillator," Eggert said. "After 30 to 45 minutes of that and CPR, they were unable to resuscitate (Dushkin)."Troopers say the Matt-Michelle subsequently took Dushkin’s body back to the village.According to troopers, neither the skipper nor Dushkin were wearing personal flotation devices when Dushkin when overboard. AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says troopers estimate Dushkin was in the water for at least 20 minutes.“No PFDs were worn at the time of this incident,” troopers wrote. “The Alaska State Troopers remind all persons to be cognizant of the dangers posed while entering onto the waters of Alaska and encourage all persons to wear personal flotation devices.”Dushkin’s next of kin have been notified. His body was awaiting transport from King Cove, which Ipsen says may have been delayed by weather.An earlier version of this story based on initial information has been corrected and updated after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Choose instead a regular- or children's-sized hamburger, which has about 250 to 300 calories. And skip the large serving of french fries or onion rings and ask for a small serving instead. This switch alone saves 200 to 300 calories.Take advantage of the healthy side dishes offered at many fast-food restaurants. For example, instead of french fries choose a side salad with low-fat dressing or a baked potato. Or add a fruit bowl or a fruit and yogurt option to your meal. Other healthy choices include apple or orange slices, corn on the cob, steamed rice, or baked potato chips.Choose an entree salad with grilled chicken, shrimp or vegetables with fat-free or low-fat dressing on the side, rather than regular salad dressing, which can have 100 to 200 calories a packet. Watch out for high-calorie salads, such as those with deep-fried shells or those topped with breaded chicken or other fried toppings. Also skip extras, such as cheese, bacon bits and croutons, which quickly increase your calorie count. If you forgo the dressing, you can find salads for around 300 calories at most fast-food chains.Fried and breaded foods, such as crispy chicken sandwiches and breaded fish fillets, are high in fat and calories. Select grilled or roasted lean meats — such as turkey or chicken breast, lean ham, or lean roast beef.Many beverages are high in calories. For example, a large regular soda (32 ounces, or 946 milliliters) has about 300 calories. Instead, order diet soda, water, unsweetened iced tea, sparkling water or mineral water. Also, skip the shakes and other ice cream drinks. Large shakes can contain more than 800 calories and all of your saturated fat allotment for the day.Remember you don't have to settle for what comes with your sandwich or meal — not even at fast-food restaurants. Ask for healthier options and substitutions. And keep your eye on portion sizes.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fast-food/art-20047179/No email address was supplied by.

Casey, public works director for the City of Seward.The sewage lagoon was built more than 30 years ago in Lowell Point, but only in the past couple years have residents started to complain about the odor.“For many years, it was totally innocuous,” said Michael Miller, whose mother sold to Seward the property on which the lagoon now sits. “People didn’t even know it was there. People would ask us what kind of fish they would catch at the hatchery up the road.”“Brown trout," Miller would joke.Miller also owns Miller’s Landing, an outdoor recreation business that includes a campground, water taxi and cabin rentals.“We worked very hard for 32 years building this business to what it is today,” said Miller, who runs the business with his wife and sons.His niece, Jamie Walker, also works at Miller’s Landing. She has lived in the Seward area for about 20 years.“The smell is so bad, and I happen to live right next to it, so I know it makes my eyes water when I come out of my cabin,” Walker said.Over the past year, Lowell Point residents and  business owners filed nearly 2,500 complaints with the state over what they call the city’s mismanagement of the facility.“I think the city's dropped the ball on this,” Miller said.In the summer of 2013, state environmental conservation officers found the City of Seward to be in noncompliance.That July, when residents say the smell was at its worst, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation found the lagoon had more than double the fecal coliform it is permitted to have.Casey said events like the Mount Marathon race bring more people to Seward and more waste into the lagoon.“We love our summer visitors, and that's quite a load in the summer time for us,” said Casey, adding that the smell comes from a lack of air circulation in the lagoon over the past few years.“The air feeds the bugs, which in turn eat the sewage,” said Casey. “The air lines are leaking back in the ground here.”Casey said he suspects that a cracked rubber casing in the pipes could also be causing the problem.There is also a buildup of “sludge,” which is composed of human waste, Casey said. The last time the sludge was removed from the pond was in 1992, he said.The city formed a plan, mandated by the state earlier this spring, and is now looking for a company that can do the work this fall for $3 million.City Manager Jim Hunt said Seward received bids Monday ranging from $3.8 million to $6 million.Lowell Point business owners fear “it’s too little, too late,” said Walker. The smell has already affected their bottom lines.“On certain days, the smell just permeates the area and customers who have been coming here for years say they’re not coming back due to that smell,” Walker said. “It’s too bad because we’re going to have to do a lot of damage control to get our customers back.”Paquette’s Angels Rest cabins cost as much as $250 a night.“We did have a pretty serious complaint the other night from people in this cabin that they wanted to sit out and drink their wine and barbecue around the campfire, and they couldn’t,” Paquette said. “So we ended up having to give them money back.”Business owners hope next summer will be better.Walker said she tells customers who complain: “’Please come back. We won't smell this bad next year.’”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Last updated at 3 p.m. Friday, May 29ANCHORAGE-- Firefighters are finally getting a handle on the large wildfire that has scorched a huge stretch of the Kenai Peninsula.The human-caused blaze sparked on May 18 near a horse trail along Funny River Road and has since engulfed an areathe size of many large cities. Portions of the fire along the west and southwest borders of the fire perimeter have diminished, and on May 30 the growth slowed substantially.KTUU.com will provide updates important to Southcentral Alaska residents in this post as information becomes available:FUNNY RIVER-- The fire on Friday, May 30, encompassed an estimated 193,243 acres, with 46 percent of the blaze contained. That amounts to about 1,000 acres of overnight growth, with identical containment from the night before. 759 firefighters and support personnel remain on scene.-- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is asking for public help as investigators seek those responsible for starting the Funny River fire. "Investigators have determined that the fire was human caused but was not the result of an abandoned campfire," USFWS officials wrote in a Wednesday statement. Anyone with information on the fire's source, or people or vehicles in the Woodcut Road area on the afternoon of May 19, should call Alaska State Troopers at 907-262-4453.-- Rainfall has helped the cause, letting firefighters on scene push ahead and expand their perimeter around the fire. But at about a tenth of an inch daily, it has not enough to stop the spread of the fire. "The rain definitely didn't hurt us, but it's not enough to put a fire of this magnitude out," said Brad Nelson, Central Emergency Services spokesperson. "It would take two or three days of hard sustained rain to have an effect on this fire."-- Containment measures a line across which fire cannot pass, meaning the firefighters actually picked up a lot of ground near residential areas while growth pushed to the east.-- After the fire is contained, firefighters will begin efforts to control the blaze, something that is still a long way off.-- Kenai Peninsula Borough spokesperson Brenda Ahlberg saidFunny River residents will see Red Cross staff going door-to-door Wednesday beginning at10 a.m. According to information relayed by Ahlberg from Red Cross spokesperson Janette Hanneman, "(t)hey will be offering food provisions, water, bug spray, eye wash, (and) fire preparedness information."-- State fire officials report that five structures -- four recreational cabins, one of which was privately owned, plus an outbuilding -- have burned in the Funny River fire as of Tuesday afternoon. None of the four cabins were being used as primary residences, and all of them were only accessible by four-wheeler or boat.-- An evacuation advisory has been canceled for residents living in the Feuding Lane and Kenai Keys Road areas.-- The evacuation order for the Funny River Road area has been canceled, and an evacuation advisory is in effect.  Residents who left the area may return to their property. The Alaska Interagency Incident Command in Soldotna is asking people to travel with caution as emergency crews continue to work on or near the road. Residents in the Funny River Road area are encouraged to remain vigilant and prepared to evacuate should fire conditions change.-- The Office of Emergency Management is currently notifying residents by Rapid Notification, KSRM 920AM and media contacts.--Kenai Peninsula Borough spokesperson Brenda Ahlberg says Funny River Road traffic has been restricted by Central Emergency Services: "They need to have unrestricted access to effectively respond. Troopers and other law enforcement agencies continue patrols throughout the area." While Ahlberg says evacuation orders remain in effect, those with critical needs remaining in the area can call Soldotna dispatchers at 262-4453 to arrange an Alaska State Trooper escort.-- The Kasilof evacuation advisory was lifted for the Sterling Highway bewteen mileposts 103 and 109, but spot fires along the western side of the fire's borders developed near milepost 102 along the Sterling Highway, heading toward Soldotna.-- Alaska Interagency Incident Command officials on the Funny River wildfire report the fire has expanded to affect more than 158,585 acres. Crews started making a “strong push” northeast Sunday night. As of Monday morning, officials report the fire remains 30 percent contained.-- Below is a map of the fire's boundaries Friday morning:(via full-size, interactive map from Alaska Division of Forestry)-- The Skilak Lake Camp Ground area was issued an evacuation notice that remains in effect Tuesday.-- Fire crews are building lines toward Kasilof, an area that hasn’t seen “a lot of fire activity” for the past few days.-- Incident management spokeswoman Michelle Weston praised the efforts of the Alaska Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter crews for mobilizing water dumps to affected areas.-- The Red Cross is operating a shelter at Redoubt Elementary School.-- Residents at emergency shelters are advised to contact family members and update them on their whereabouts and current condition. This should include out of state family, as this fire is now a nationally televised story, and they too may worry if their loved ones are affected.-- A house fire and spot fires being handled by CES has led to an evacuation advisory for residents along Feuding Lane and Kenai Keys Road in Soldotna. Visit AK Interagency Incident ManagementFacebook pagefor updates.-- Fire crews back burned on Funny River Road near milepost 7 Sunday afternoon, limiting traffic to property owners but building an effective fire line in the area.-- The Funny River fire grew overnight Saturday and early Sunday to 123,649 acres. Fire officials estimate 20 percent of the blaze is contained. The fire has grown dramatically throughout the past few days: 78,213 early Friday, 96,584 late Friday and 106,000 late Saturday.-- An evacuation advisory issued for the Funny River fire area was extended to include the Sterling Highway from Kalifornsky Beach Road to Mile 109.5 and Funny River Road from the airport to the end of the road. That advisory remained in effect Sunday morning.-- Travelers are advised to use Kalifornsky Beach Road for all necessary movement in the area.-- Media briefings will be held daily at 10 a.m., 1:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. until the fire is under control in an effort to streamline information to residents. Central Emergency Services and leaders from the Type 2 management team will coordinate the briefings.-- Residents living between miles 103 and 105 of the Sterling Highway were ordered to evacuate on Saturday night at about 11 p.m. According to those in charge of the fire response, it was determined thatthe fire died down enough to allow residents back to their homes just before 3 a.m., so the evacuation order was reversed. The area remains under an evacuation advisory, meaning residents should be ready in case fire activity picks up and they need to get out of harms way.--The Division of Forestry confirmed a Type 2 Incident Management Team from Washington state will be taking over the Funny River fire area Saturday, May 24.-- An early Friday morning estimate suggests the wildfire encompasses 67,084 acres, according to the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team. Night operations involving 218 personnel yielded 15 percent containment, up from 5 percent a day earlier.-- By 11 a.m., 374 personnel were assigned to fight the fire, with an expected uptick to more than 500 over the weekend.CL215 water bombers from Alberta, Canadaare facilitating efforts to attack the fire by scooping up water from nearby Skilak and Tustumena lakes, while ground crews are doing heavy lifting to hold a line near residential areas.-- A red flag warning remains in place Friday, meaning weather conditions make it likely that wildfires could spread quickly without vigilant efforts. Sustained winds 8 to 16 miles per hour are predicted, and there is no chance of rain. Winds blew away from residential areas early in the day, but shortly before noon they shifted and started blowing in the direction of town.-- More than 400 people attended Thursday evening community meetings hosted by fire official at Tustumena Elementary School in Kasilof and Funny River Road Community Center. The incident commander and an array of officials took questions and outlined what would need to happen if an evacuation is ordered.Some residents expressed concerns with the response efforts and communication with officials; others said they were pleased with the response.-- A temporary flight restriction remains in place over Funny River, with no pilots allowed to fly between sea level and 4,000 feet. Pilots planning trips to the village should check Federal Aviation Agency NOTAM 4/4812 if they intend to fly in the area. The Soldotna Airport remains open and flights are taking off as scheduled, according to the city.-- Flights are still allowed in and out of the Soldotna Airport, and an employee reported decent visibility through the haze early Thursday. Pilots should check current information before takeoff if they intend to land in Soldotna.-- Air quality in communities across the Kenai Peninsula remains poor, with warnings from the state Department of Health and Human Services. Residents are cautioned to stay inside if they have breathing problems due to ash and smoke settling.-- Flame retardants could be used to battle the flames, something that would upset many residents, as it is unclear what effect it would have on this summer's salmon runs. "They'll only be used near water if there's no other option," said Brad Nelson.-- While many people want to see the fire, the Alaska State Troopers are patrolling to keep people back from Funny River Road so fire personnel can respond without traffic interference. Anyone who wants a safe vantage point is encouraged to go to Mile 106 of the Sterling Highway in Soldotna.BELUGA & TYONEKLast updated at noon Wednesday, May 28--The Division of Forestry says the fire that sparked Sunday, May 18, and burned dangerously close to the Cook Inlet village of Tyonek was 100 percent contained early Wednesday. That means there is a firm line drawn around the fire, across which flames cannot cross. 112 personnel assigned to the fire are being released today, but a hand crew will stay on site to work toward controlling the fire.-- Sarah Saarloos, Division of Forestry spokesperson, said the remaining crew will make a grid of the area and search the nearly 2,000 acres for any hot spots. "They'll be physically going through the area where the fire burned and looking for heat they can see or feel in areas underneath trees or berms that might be holding heat," Saarloos said. That process should take about a week, she said.-- The final boundary shows an estimated 1,906 acres burned in the blaze.--No serious injuries occurred in the effort to fight the fire, but a significant safety concern for firefighters continues to be standing trees which have been weakened by the fire and may topple in windy conditions while they mop up.-- Tyonek residents evacuated when the fire burned close to the village, but they were allowed back into town a couple days later. No one was injured.-- Firefighters successfully established lines around village sites in Beluga and Tyonek and at oil and gas sites, a power plant and key infrastructure sites, with attacks from the ground and the sky. No homes were lost, and only five structures overall were taken by the fire: two outbuildings and three abandoned metal storage units.-- One common concern expressed by residents was that flame retardants be used only far away from waterways salmon runs, something a forestry spokesperson said firefighters agreed to do.-- The village of Tyonek is composed of about 100 people, and the influx offirefighters doubled the population overnight."We don't have a grocery store," says Debra Call of the Tyonek Native Corporation. "We need to be able to feed the firefighters, house them. We can only rely upon donations, and we need help right now." Anyone who wants to donate money or goods can find out how on the Tyonek Native Corporation'sFacebook page. Corporate sponsors and individuals had provided more than $24,000 on Friday morning.-- A temporary flight restriction remains in effect over Tyonek, with no pilots allowed to fly between sea level and 5,000 feet. Pilots planning trips to the village should check Federal Aviation Agency NOTAM 4/4824 if they intend to fly to the area.ANCHORAGE & MAT-SU-- Heading into the weekend, the Anchorage Fire Department on Friday, May 30, announced a burn ban that lasted more than a week has been lifted. A ban remains in effect on the Kenai Peninsula-- An air quality advisory in Anchorage, issued due to smoke from the Funny River and Tyonek wildfires, was lifted at 1:40 p.m. May 20.  In a statement, city Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Jennifer Ruggles writes that "Smoke concentrations have dissipated, and air quality is now good throughout the Municipality of Anchorage. Anchorage Air Quality Program expects that air quality conditions will remain good under the current weather pattern."-- The Alaska Air Monitoring Network reports Monday air quality in Anchorage has worsened to "moderate" since last reported Friday when it was in "good" condition.-- Weather forecasts call for rain beginning Tuesday, which could bring some relief to crews battling fires both in Tyonek and along the Kenai Peninsula.-- The Alaska Air Monitoring Network reports air quality in Anchorage improved to "good" on Friday, May 23. A day earlier the network called parts of the city's air "unhealthy" and other parts "moderate." The Department of Health and Human Services recommended Thursday that Anchorage residents stay indoors and refrain from strenuous exercise due to the smoke level.-- The Mat-Su Borough enacted an air quality advisory for the entire borough from 8 a.m. Thursday until the fires are extinguished and the smoke clears. Due to the smoky conditions, the air quality in these areas has become unhealthy to hazardous. The 24-hour Air Quality Alert System phone number, 907-352-3878, provides updates on the advisory.-- The Anchorage School District recommended that all outdoor activities be held inside Thursday, the last day of school.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But the risk for macular degeneration goes up as you get older. Other factors play a role, too. A family history of the disease, race, lifestyle choices such as smoking and diet, and underlying medical conditions can all increase the likelihood of developing macular degeneration.The macula is the part of your eye that allows you to see fine details in your vision. You need it for tasks such as driving, reading and recognizing faces. The macula is located in the center of your retina -- the layer of tissue on the inside back wall of your eyeball.There are two kinds of macular degeneration. The kind you have,dry macular degeneration, is more common. It happens when retinal cells in the macula die, causing the macula to break down. The other form of this disease is calledwet macular degeneration. That happens when blood vessels under the retina leak blood and fluid into the macula.Some of the risk factors for macular degeneration are beyond your control. For example, the older you are, the more likely you are to develop macular degeneration. The disease is most common in people older than 65, but the risk begins to go up significantly beginning around age 50.Genetics appear to have an effect, too. If someone in your family had macular degeneration, then you are more likely to develop it. Race also makes a difference. Macular degeneration is more common in Caucasians than it is in other races.There are other risk factors, however, that you can control. People who don’t smoke are less likely to develop macular degeneration than people who do. Maintaining a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet lower the risk, too. Effectively managing other chronic health problems, such ashigh blood pressure,heart diseaseandhigh cholesterol, also can make macular degeneration less likely.Even after the diagnosis of macular degeneration, there are still steps you can take that may help slow vision loss, including a range of healthy diet choices. Research has shown that vitamins A, C and E, along with zinc and copper, are particularly beneficial for people who have macular degeneration. With that in mind, eat lots of fruits and vegetables every day. The wider the range of the fruits and vegetables, the more variety of vitamins you will have in your diet.Omega-3 fatty acids also may help reduce the risk of vision loss related to macular degeneration. Omega-3 fatty acids are best consumed from nutritional sources rather than supplements. They can be found in fish, such as salmon, sardines and tuna, and nuts such as walnuts.It is important that you look for changes in your vision using an Amsler grid. The grid is much like a crossword puzzle grid. You should check each eye separately by covering up the other eye. If the lines appear wavy or are missing, it could mean that either the dry macular degeneration has progressed, or that the dry has converted to the wet form. The wet form means there is a blood vessel growing under the macula. This needs prompt treatment, most commonly with medications injected into the eye, starting on a monthly basis. Prompt intervention can treat this unwanted blood vessel and slow down or even improve your vision.Talk to your doctor about diet choices that may be appropriate for you, as well as other treatment options for macular degeneration. Increasing your vitamin intake through supplements could be useful in slowing vision loss. Although treatment cannot reverse the effects of dry macular degeneration, that does not mean you will lose all of your vision. In many cases, the disease progresses slowly, and people are often able to perform many of their day-to-day activities even though they have macular degeneration.—Sophie J.

Its sighting was relayed to the 378-foot high endurance cutter Morgenthau, on patrol during Operation North Pacific Guard, part of an international effort to counter drift-net fishing -- the use of massive nets which take bycatch ranging from marine mammals to seabirds.“The practice is universally condemned and is a significant threat to ocean ecosystems and to the food and economic security of nations and communities that rely on fisheries resources,” Coast Guard officials wrote. “The Yin Yuan displayed characteristics of large-scale high seas drift net fishing to include: net tube, net spreader, net bin, nets and net buoys on deck, and the sighting information was passed to the crew of the Morgenthau.”The Morgenthau caught up with the Yin Yuan about 625 miles east of Tokyo, Japan, where the crew claimed Chinese registry -- a possibility the cutter was prepared for.“The crew of the Morgenthau intercepted and boarded the vessel with two law enforcement officials from the China Coast Guard’s Fisheries Law Enforcement Command and interviewed the master,” officials wrote. “Since 1994, the Coast Guard and NOAA Fisheries Service have annually hosted law enforcement officers from the China Fishery Law Enforcement Command (China coast guard this year) onboard Coast Guard cutters patrolling in the North Pacific Ocean.”While the ship’s master admitted to having thrown some 3.3 kilometers of drift net and other fishing gear overboard before being stopped, the boarding party found roughly half a ton of salmon aboard. In addition to the use of the drift net, boarders found evidence that the Yin Yuan hadn’t maintained sufficient data on its catch, and didn’t have properly issued fishing permits from a recognized authority.The commander of the Coast Guard’s 17th District, Rear Adm. Thomas Ostebo, praised the multilateral effort against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing -- backed by a United Nations moratorium -- which led to the Yin Yuan’s seizure."This seizure is a direct result of the teamwork between the Coast Guard and our Chinese, Japanese, and Canadian law enforcement partners," Ostebo said in the statement. "IUU vessels are a scourge on our living marine resources that we are only able to stop through the application of our long range resources, such as high endurance and national security cutters, and international cooperation."Petty Officer 3rd Class Grant DeVuyst, a spokesperson with the 17th District, says the Yin Yuan was first spotted on May 22, then boarded from the Morgenthau on May 27."The ship was spotted from the Canadian plane, and they had Japanese spotters on board who were helping, so (it was) a real team effort," DeVuyst said.The Morgenthau transferred the Yin Yuan to the custody of the China coast guard cutter 2102 in the East China Sea on Tuesday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The closure is expected to last for most of 2014’s Chinook run.Traditionally, both commercial and subsistence fishermen cast a gill net to haul in their catch. That won't be the case during this closure, and user groups on the river are reacting differently to the various fishing opportunities available.Salmon are returning to the Yukon, and Fish and Game is informing fishermen of the latest indicators from a test fishery. Out on the river chum salmon feed a cash economy, but kings won't be served at many tables here.“Not being able to harvest that resource could invariably impact the health of our people,” said fisherman Nick Tucker Sr.Gillnet salmon fishing is closed on the Yukon, a conservative decision by the state aimed at protecting kings. Using a gill net can be an efficient way to feed a family, but so far this year only dip nets are being allowed.“We are hampered adversely by the type of gear that we are allowed to use,” Tucker said.Dip net users say they require more time on the river, but the state says right now that's the only way to preserve salmon runs.“If we weren't using that, where we could release the king salmon, we'd be closed totally -- so it's allowing opportunity for other salmon, and yet protecting kings,” said Dan Bergstrom, Fish and Game’s Arctic/Yukon/Kuskokwim regional fisheries management coordinator.This year’s Chinook run is expected to be the state’s worst ever.“Our main thing with the dip nets is we want people to be able to catch chum salmon for subsistence needs but really be careful with the Chinook,” Bergstrom said.On the other hand some commercial fishermen on the Yukon, like Kwik’Pak Fisheries general manager Jack Schultheis, see the situation as a win-win.“Having the dip net fishery allowed us to do two things -- it allowed us to have a commercial fishery and at the same time we weren't harming kings,” Schultheis said.Kwik’Pak reports doubling its chum harvest last year, a big plus for towns like Emmonak.“It's helped tremendously to keep the communities going here,” Schultheis said.Commercially the gear appears to work, but subsistence fishermen say it's a hindrance for drying and smoking salmon. Both are adapting to new rules for fisheries that have survived for so long, but now expect small king returns.The state says it's too early to say just how many kings are returning this year. Sonar equipment officials use to count the fish is expected to come online at Pilot Station Wednesday.No email address was supplied by.

She says they had plans to spend about a week in the area.“These two gentlemen went to a lodge to do a self-guided fishing trip,” Ipsen said. “They have done this fairly often and know the area.”Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 1st Class Shawn Eggert says Comfort and Rupprecht were in an 18-foot Lund skiff on Sumner Strait, north of the Level Islands and south of Kah Sheets Bay, when they went into the water. They called the Petersburg Police Department shortly before 6 p.m.“It looks like the people in the water had contacted PPD via cellphone for 45 minutes,” Eggert said. “They (said they) had (personal flotation devices), but no survival suits; the cellphone call cut out.”The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter to search for the skiff, with Alaska State Troopers in both Wrangell and Petersburg alerted to assist with the search. While a full shoreline search of the area was unsuccessful as of 10 p.m., troopers found the capsized skiff and the Jayhawk crew found a cooler it had been carrying.At about 11 p.m., Eggert says the Jayhawk’s crew reported spotting the two men in the water near the overturned skiff.“The MH-60 directed troopers to the location of the people; each was recovered and determined to be deceased,” Eggert said. “Neither of them were wearing a life jacket with personal locator beacons when found.”Conditions reported by search crews in the area at the time included visibility of 10 nautical miles under an 800-foot cloud ceiling, with 2-foot seas. Eggert says it’s not clear whether the men falsely claimed to have been wearing life jackets, or whether they were wearing life jackets but they slipped off at some point during the evening.“The weather was pretty calm,” Eggert said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Get tips on how to properly clean a fish bowl here.<COL>iStock/ScantyNebulaWhile fish can be low maintenance pets, you do need to regularly clean their bowl. Get tips on how to properly clean a fish bowl here.Prep the new water:Before you start cleaning the bowl, you need to get the new water ready. This should be done the day before. You will replace about 40 percent of the bowl’s water, so estimate about how much that is and then put it in a clean, soap-free container. You then need to treat the water with drops from your water treatment kit. After adding the treatment, make sure you cover the water and let it sit overnight so the water becomes room temperature.Remove your fish:The next day, it’s time to actually clean the fish bowl. The first step is to remove your fish from the bowl via a net. Place your fish in the treated water container.Strain the water:Take about half of the existing water in the bowl and pour it into the new, treated water. When adding it to the treated water, do so through a strainer to remove and solid waste from the water.Scrub the bowl:With the water out, empty the bowl and scrub the sides to remove any waste or algae. Do not use soap when cleaning. Rinse the bowl when done.Clean the rocks:If you have any rocks in the bowl make sure you scrub and rinse those thoroughly.Add back the treated water:Pour the 40 percent of new, treated water and the 60 percent of the strained old water back into the bowl. Then add back the gravel.Put your fish back in the clean bowl:When the bowl is set, carefully put your fish back into its clean bowl.No email address was supplied by.

Lisa Murkowski’s office Tuesday. Gov. Sean Parnelldeclared a state disasterafter ice jams caused flooding along the Yukon River from May 17 to June 11, 2013, followed bya federal disaster declaration from President Obama.In the report, the inspector general’s office finds that FEMA “prudently” opted to build permanent homes for displaced residents, as well as providing financial aid for a State of Alaska temporary camp for responders to the disaster. It also says that FEMA could improve “its response to the unique needs of disaster survivors and communities who have limited cash resources and who reside in remote and inaccessible locations.”“Specifically, FEMA approved Other Needs Assistance policy changes for Alaska on February 14, 2013, but did not implement them in its business rules until June 28, 2013 (finalized July 9, 2013) -- roughly a month after the disaster occurred,” DHS officials wrote.Other factors, such as the delay between the flooding and Obama’s June 25 federal disaster declaration, also played into the delays FEMA experienced on the ground.Officials in Alaska told the Inspector General’s office that FEMA’s refusal to airlift supplies into Galena, alongside cheaper barge shipments, both slowed the supply of emergency goods to the town and harmed local merchants -- who might have instead been sources to aid FEMA’s response.“Consequently, the disaster supplies and materials placed on the barges took the space ordinarily used for transporting other items,” DHS officials wrote. “In turn, local merchants suffered financially. They believe many will go bankrupt.”Other officials in-state questioned the slowness of FEMA’s Other Needs Assistance program, which the report says covers items including “boats, motors, fishing gear, guns, and other items necessary for the disaster survivors to feed their families and prepare for the winter.”“Those officials believed that the delay between the date of the disaster and the date of the Major Disaster Declaration delayed FEMA’s ability to authorize the purchase of guns and fishing gear,” DHS officials wrote. “Consequently, some families lost the opportunity to supply their own food for the winter.”Other criticisms included delays in FEMA aid for systems to recycle “waste heat” from buildings, which can pay for itself in winter. Questions also surrounded the agency’s initial award of $542,080 to the local senior center, which was later reduced by an insurance specialist to $22,421 amid concerns that it also benefited from the National Flood Insurance Program.The Tanana Chiefs Conference also told the inspector general’s office that it had hoped to serve as an intermediary between FEMA and tribal governments. It asked that local groups be consulted during future FEMA responses.FEMA management agreed with the report’s four conclusions, two of which the inspector general’s office considers closed due to action by the agency -- working with states to “identify and address the unique needs of nontraditional communities,” and continuing to monitor arrangements like Galena’s permanent housing contracts and temporary responder camps for signs of corruption, waste or abuse.Two other recommendations, that FEMA try to incorporate local geographical requirements into evaluating contracts or bids, and that it work more closely with tribal governments, are classified as resolved and open with work continuing on both.In a statement accompanying the report, Murkowski says she finds the report’s conclusions regarding FEMA’s readiness to address rural disasters “reassuring.”“I am grateful that the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General saw the worth of looking closer at the Galena response,” Murkowski said. “In the end, the IG believes that while FEMA exercised good faith and best efforts to respond to last summer’s tragedy on the Yukon River, it wasn’t as ready as it should have been.”In addition to calling upon FEMA to work more close with Alaska Native leaders while working in rural Alaska, Murkowski also asks the agency to more closely take the state’s unique circumstances into account.“When I heard from Galena residents last summer, a primary concern was FEMA’s reluctance to fly needed supplies into the community because it was less expensive to barge them,” Murkowski said. “The Inspector General suggests that FEMA should have been more flexible in addressing the challenges of the short construction season -- even if it meant higher costs.”FEMA officials reached for comment Tuesday say they have not seen the report and can’t yet comment on it.Channel 2’s Rebecca Palsha contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

While the cause of the fire is under investigation, troopers said it appears accidental in nature and that the fire appears to have originated near the porch.When the blaze sparked, Andrew was able to escape but went and tried to help Achayok get out. The effort was unsuccessful, Andrew suffered burns and Achayok died.The house was a total loss.Troopers from King Salmon and an Anchorage-based deputy fire marshal arrived later in the afternoon to investigate. Foul play is not suspected, but Achayok's remains will be sent to the State Medical Examiner's Office for positive identification and an autopsy.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Keep extra in your tackle box so you’re not caught without it.Variety of hooks:Make sure you keep a variety of hooks in your tackle box so you’re prepared for different types  -- and sizes -- of fish.Sinkers:Sinkers are easy to lose during fishing trips, so it’s a good idea to keep extras in your box. After all, you need the sinker to help keep the bait and hook under water.Lures:If putting live bait on a hook isn’t working it’s good to have some extra lures in your tackle box to give those a try.First-aid kit:Always be prepared when fishing so it’s important to keep a first-aid kit in your tackle box. Make sure you have anti-bacterial ointment as part of it, and bandages, in case you get stuck with a hook.Sunscreen:Spending a day on the water can result in sunburn.

Troopers were first informed of the case last year.“Basically he was accused of harassing people in a small boat by driving his large boat straight at them at a high rate of speed on purpose, then turning away at the very last minute,” Ipsen wrote in an email to Channel 2. “It really, really scared them.”Even after the conviction, Ipsen says it’s not clear why Koechling targeted the skiff in the first place.“Nothing seemed to prompt it; there's no real thing that apparently triggered this,” Ipsen said. “He was coming within inches of ramming the boat.”The possibility of a fishing rivalry was mentioned in court, but quickly dismissed in Friday’s decision at the end of the three-day bench trial.“Of interesting note during closing comments, the judge expressly related that this case was not about sport fishing versus commercial, but that of community condemnation, deterrence, and that this behavior presented a significant and exceptional risk to the occupants of the other vessel,” troopers wrote.Koechling was given a 700-day jail sentence with 649 days suspended. He is scheduled to begin serving the remaining 51 days on Aug. 15.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Wildlife officials say the sow was a relatively small 200 pounds.Part of what contributed to this incident was the loose dogs, according to Jessy Coltrane, a wildlife biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.While dogs can help keep bears away by barking and alerting their owners when danger is near, Coltrane said it all depends on how a dog acts if it comes across a bear."The biggest risk with a dog is if they run ahead and provoke a bear then very often as soon as they feel threatened they run back to you, because they feel safe with you," Coltrane said. "So they bring the bears back."With fish currently running in a nearby scenic stream that often draws hikers, Crockett said it is important to remember the basics: make noise, travel in groups, pay close attention when in bear country.Berry patches, bear scat, kill sites and anything else that suggests a bear may be near are the biggest red flags, Crockett said.The attack is the second in the area in less than a week.Sgt. Lucas Wendeborn of the Alaska Army National Guardwas mauled by a brown bear Sunday during a training exercise on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

The pair have previously produced offspring, witha female pup born last year.“Eden is a very attentive mother and the pup has been successfully nursing,” officials wrote. “The pup’s first weight came in at 37.7 pounds (17.1 kg).”The previous pup, Ellie, was born in June 2013. At the time, the center described the birth as the first successful breeding of two sea lions in captivity since the mid-1980s.“At thirteen months old, Ellie now weighs 166 pounds (75.5 kg) and has learned to eat fish and follow basic commands from her trainers,” officials wrote.According to Dr. Lori Polasek, a University of Alaska Fairbanks research assistant professor and a scientist at the center, biologists have been learning important details from Eden and Woody about sea lion pregnancy and pup care.While the pup won’t be named or placed on public display for a few months, there are already plans at the center for a possible name.“Like all of our Stellers, he will be named after a Steller sea lion rookery or haul out area,” officials wrote in an email to Channel 2.Channel 2’s Reba Lean contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

In fact they were downright yellow at the edges. And with the dry spell we’ve been having, the “off” color definitely was not due to overwatering. When I checked the Internet for answers, it seemed the problem with my posies might be lack of nitrogen. This mineral is one of the most important nutrients for plants, necessary for their production of proteins, amino acids and DNA. So I called the savviest gardening expert I know – my mother – for advice on how to naturally supplement my geraniums’ diet and give them the nitrogen they crave. Her immediate response: “Coffee grounds.”Coffee GroundsMom was right. No-cost and readily available,coffeegrounds are an excellent way to add nitrogen to your garden. In the process of decomposition, the leavings from your morning cup of java give off nitrogen, together with phosphorus and potassium. Mix the grounds gently into your soil, or add them to the compost pile. In the latter case, make sure that they are fairly dry so they don’t interfere with the aerobic quality of your heap. Although coffee beans are naturally acidic, the brewing process neutralizes their acid content to an insignificant figure.Higher-Nitrogen CompostSpeaking of composting, it’s a great way to reduce landfills and replenish the earth. However, the typical mix of compostable materials may not contain enough nitrogen for nitrogen-loving crops like tomatoes, spinach, cabbage, corn and potatoes. High protein substances and fresh greens are best for boosting the nitrogen level of compost. Some examples are alfalfa, cottonseed or soy meal; composted manure or chicken droppings; fresh lawn clippings (free of herbicide or pesticide) and fresh fruit and vegetable scraps.Seaweedis also a good source, though a period of about fifteen weeks is necessary for its cellulose content to break down enough to release nitrogen. Please note that your municipality may have regulations concerning what types of materials are permitted in your compost heap. This is not an arbitrary restriction, but designed for effective pest control and other large cities.Wise PlantingAnother way to enrich your garden soil with nitrogen is by careful crop management. Rotate your crops, following a high-nitrogen-consuming veggie or flower with one that needs much less of this mineral. Or plant a cover crop of legumes – plants like peas, beans, alfalfa or clover. These leguminous cover crops, planted early in the spring or in autumn, are excellent for the purpose of nitrogen fixation – depositing nitrogen absorbed from the air into their root nodules. Just cut the legumes down before they flower and become woody; then dig the plants under to work that nitrogen into the earth where you want it. This process helps to loosen and aerate the soil as well.CautionOver-enthusiastic application of nitrogen can be counterproductive. It can stimulate plants such as tomatoes to grow disproportionately, resulting in strong, healthy stalks and stunted fruit, and might also burn them, especially if it comes into contact with their leaves. Excessive amounts of nitrogen may seep or run off into nearby water systems, causingaccelerated growth of algae. These algae produce toxins and bacteria, making the affected water dangerous for drinking. In addition, it decreases or totally eliminates oxygen in the water, with illness and death for the fish population as the devastating consequence.Test your soil before enriching it with nitrogen, and apply the mineral in small quantities.

Clough says the road hasn’t had a major overhaul since World War II."The road is not in good shape to meet the various needs of the highway," Clough said.A 2011 DOT study pegged average daily traffic near the eagle gathering grounds at 518 vehicles. Another report recommends the agency replace any cottonwoods cut down during the project.Environmentalists say DOT’s plans to accelerate the highway expansion have them concerned on a variety of fronts. They point to the agency's use of stone rip-rap for shoring up embankments, and fear it will impede salmon spawning and eventually cause  rather than prevent Chilkat River erosion. Holle says reducing the speed limit would help streamline construction."There are 19 curves on the highway that would need to be straightened now for a 55-mile-per-hour design standard," Holle said. "If you reduce it to 50 miles per hour, only two curves need to be straightened."DOT says it hopes to have the project fully permitted before the end of the year with construction starting in the summer of 2015.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is managing the river by asking people to exercise individual restraint and not target king salmon.The strength of the run is expected to be as bad as last year and that was the smallest return on record. Managers warn harvesting too many kings this early may further restrict fishing opportunities.“We really don't want people to be out there targeting kings at this point, and if it looks like that may be happening, I do have the flexibility to implement those four-inch gear restrictions earlier in the season,” said Brian McCaffery, acting manager of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.USFWS officials say if there are enough kings they'd like to allow qualifying communities to share a limited harvest for cultural purposes, but that all depends on compliance with restrictions and in-season information.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"Our creeks contain urban salmon that run in our urban Cook Inlet, where a lot of other salmon exist as well."Northon says a combination of volunteer efforts and educating the public has helped the creeks become cleaner."Eighty percent of trash out in the Pacific Ocean starts on the land in our watersheds, so if we keep it clean here, it helps weigh out the bags and plastics that are breaking down," Northon said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Troopers later determined that the incident involved two men -- 31-year-old James B. Miller of Spokane, Wash., and his father, 49-year-old James F. Miller of Cashmere, Wash.In an email, AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says the two men began Sunday with a celebration of the holiday in Cordova.“They spent Father’s Day together. This included dinner and drinks on the boat,” Ipsen wrote. “Afterwards, they took the boat out (without permission from the boat owner who is a commercial fisherman).”After the Coast Guard says the Chugach ran aground at about 4 a.m. Monday near Fish Bay, on the east end of Hinchinbrook Island, Ipsen says the evening culminated in a drunken brawl -- with the elder Miller employing an explosive device usually used to scare predators away from fishing nets.“At one point he threw what’s called a seal bomb at his son, but it didn’t hit him and landed in the bunk next to him,” Ipsen said.As the Chugach neared the island, the younger Miller laid down an ultimatum for his father.“After the altercation, the younger Miller told his dad to get off the boat, which according to Miller he did,” troopers wrote in a dispatch on the incident. “The younger Miller passed out and woke up around (10 a.m) to find the vessel high and dry on a sandbar.”The boat wasn’t permanently stuck, and the son tried to reach his dad before it left the sandbar.“Later in the day as the tide was rising Miller texted his dad to return to the boat or he would leave him behind,” troopers wrote.Ipsen says the threat wasn’t relayed, as the boat refloated and its engine compartment began to take on water.“Because his dad’s from Washington, he doesn’t have cellphone reception, so he never got the text,” Ipsen said.The younger Miller placed distress calls by radio to the Coast Guard and by telephone to police, while his father made his way along the shoreline.“At one point he ended up curling up under a tarp -- he walked eight miles,” Ipsen said.When Miller found shelter at an occupied cabin on the east side of the island, he initially asked its residents for walking directions back to Cordova.“And that’s when they told him, ‘You’re actually on an island, so there’s not much point in trying to walk back to Cordova,’” Ipsen said.The Coast Guard launched aircraft including an HC-130 search plane from Kodiak and an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter from Cordova, with the cutter Sycamore launching a small boat that had to turn back due to poor weather. After about an hour of searching, the chopper’s crew spotted Miller outside the cabin and flew him back to Cordova; the Coast Guard says he didn’t require any medical attention.“The conditions were just horrible, but the Coast Guard was still out there searching for him,” Ipsen said. “The Coast Guard managed to pick him up and bring him back to the hangar, and that’s where the trooper talked to him.”Cordova troopers arrested both men Thursday, charging both with boating under the influence of alcohol. The elder Miller faces additional charges of third-degree domestic-violence assault and fifth-degree criminal mischief, while his son is also charged with one count of vehicle theft.Ipsen says damage dealt to the Chugach in the grounding was minor, and the vessel has since been returned to its owner and repaired.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Two Washington men -- 47-year-old Earnest Pierce of Nine Mile Falls and 24-year-old Brandon Michael Park of West Richland -- climbed onto the skiff and were picked up, but troopers say none of the four were wearing life jackets.“An adult male and a 17-year-old juvenile attempted to swim to shore,” troopers wrote. “The older male was later located in the water and was unresponsive.  Efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.  Efforts by rescuers on scene to locate the missing juvenile were unsuccessful.”Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 2nd Class DeVuyst says the Coast Guard doesn’t typically conduct river rescues, since its mission is in the area is focused on patrolling the Bering Sea.“We don’t have a constant operating presence there -- we have our air assets that can respond to this,” DeVuyst said. “It’s about a two-hour flight from Kodiak for one of our Jayhawks, and by the time we got there from Kodiak, a good Samaritan had not only recovered the two men but also recovered the body of the deceased and the boat.”DeSpain says the skiff was relatively large, but both the lack of flotation devices and weather conditions at the time contributed to the capsizing’s deadly outcome.“Apparently it was about a 30-foot skiff with a 150-(horsepower) motor aboard,” DeSpain said. “Our trooper said that when it’s like that, people don’t usually go out.”The Coast Guard suspended its search for the missing 17-year-old Sunday night; neither the missing boater nor the man who died have been identified pending notification of next of kin. Troopers are also unlikely to continue search efforts in the incident.“I don’t think we’re actively continuing the search,” DeSpain said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"(It's) the spikes that they either gut themselves on, or hang up a leg or they catch their hooves in the opening where the spikes are.”Anchorage Assembly member Jennifer Johnston wants to help prevent that from happening in the future. On Tuesday, she’ll be introducing an ordinance that would regulate metal fences.“As most of us know, moose are more likely to be killed on the roads than by these fences, but it was something I saw that we could do something about,” Johnston said.The Atwood Mansion and Estates, as well as Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, prominently feature spiked fences. In years past, both locations have been the site of multiple moose impalements -- but both have since been fixed, by adding flat bars across the top or capping the spikes to make them moose-proof.If passed, Johnston’s ordinance could follow that lead. She says older fences haven't been covered by law, while taller designs don't threaten moose.“All the fences that are currently there are grandfathered in, so they don’t have to fix it,” said Johnston. “It’s getting it above nine feet; it’s the four to six feet where you have your problems.”Coltrane said a moose is impaled at least once or twice a year on palisade fences.“I know where every single palisade fence is in this town, because at one time or another I’ve either removed a dead moose or shot a live moose off of the fence,” Coltrane said. “When it happens, it’s usually a pretty gruesome event.”The ordinance will be introduced at Tuesday night’s Assembly meeting. A public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Aug. 5.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It’s a sacrifice that will be felt by everyone on the river this year but also one that is largely understood.“I think people all up and down the Kuskokwim, they cherish the Chinook salmon and they want to pass that opportunity on to their children and grandchildren and so forth,” Gillikin said.Kings are bound to be caught incidentally but managers are encouraging they will be released by fishermen who will likely be able to target more abundant species.“Once it's determined that we're going to meet those escapement goals then we're really praying that there will be opportunity for people to go out and get chum and reds,” Hoffman said.New and unprecedented restrictions are already in place for this season. Whatever fishing opportunities will be available for fishermen will depend on how many kings return to the Kuskokwim.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Osteopenia can be a precursor to osteoporosis, but that is not always the case. Treatment for these disorders is similar because the treatment goals for both are to strengthen bones and slow bone loss.Bones are in a constant state of renewal. Your body regularly makes new bone and breaks down old bone. When you are young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone, and your bone mass increases. Most people reach their peak bone mass in their mid-20s to mid-30s.As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it is created. That means the higher your peak bone mass is when you are young, the more bone your body has to sustainbone healththroughout the rest of your life.Osteopenia develops when a person’s bone density is below normal. This condition raises the risk of bone fractures. Osteoporosis occurs when the body’s creation of new bone can no longer keep up with the breakdown of old bone. This leads to bones becoming weak, brittle and easily broken.Osteopenia and osteoporosis are often diagnosed based on results of a bone density test. The test measures how many grams of calcium and other bone minerals are in a segment of bone. Bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and forearm. The higher the bone mineral content, the denser the bones are. The denser the bones are, the stronger they are and the less likely they are to break.Results of bone density tests are reported in a number called a T-score. A T-score of -1 or higher is considered normal. T-scores between -1 and -2.5 are labeled as osteopenia. A T-score of -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis. In some situations, a person may be diagnosed with osteoporosis if she or he has a bone that breaks easily, even if the T-score is not in the osteoporosis range.Osteoporosis requires treatment. Treatment may be appropriate for osteopenia in some cases. Medications called bisphosphonates are often prescribed for people who have osteoporosis and osteopenia. These drugs are useful because they have been shown to slow the bone breakdown process. Examples of bisphosphonates include alendronate, risedronate and ibandronate, among others.Getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet also can help keep your bones healthy. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70.Good sources of calcium include low-fat dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, canned sardines with bones, canned salmon and soy products. Many cereals and juices also are calcium-fortified.Vitamin D is necessary for your body to absorb calcium. People may get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight. If you’re diagnosed with osteopenia or osteoporosis, however, your doctor can do a blood test to check your level of vitamin D. If it is too low, you may need a vitamin D supplement.Regular exercise can help build strong bones and slow bone loss, too. A combination of strength training exercises with weight-bearing exercises is usually best. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine. Weight-bearing exercises -- such as walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skipping rope or skiing -- have a positive effect on the entire skeleton and in particular benefit the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine.Swimming, cycling and exercising on machines such as elliptical trainers can provide a good cardiovascular workout. Because these exercises are low impact, however, they are not as helpful for improving bone strength as weight-bearing exercises.—Bart Clarke, M.D., Endocrinology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.Source: http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tuesday-q-a-treatment-for-bone-disorders-focuses-on-strengthening-bones-slowing-bone-lossNo email address was supplied by.

Forty villages and approximately 14,000 people qualify, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.The Orutsararmiut Native Council had submitted a request to further limit the pool of qualified users to only those who have dried and smoked salmon in the traditional way for at least 10 years.The board did not take any action on that request, but deferred any allocation decisions to the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge Manager, who will have access to in-season information.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Areas that would be affected by the ban include fishing spots around Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Valdez and Ketchikan."We think there are other methods and other styles of commercial fishing that would be more appropriate to help sustain a long-term resource for the state," said Clark Penney, AFCA's executive director.  "So, really, the purpose of the initiative is to ask for a short-term adjustment for a long-term sustainability for a statewide resource."In January, Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell -- who also heads the state's Division of Elections -- rejected the alliance's initiative because he says it violates the state constitution. Treadwell says salmon are a state asset, which can't be appropriated by citizens through the initiative process."The unfortunate thing for them is that the Supreme Court and the constitution says you cannot effectively allocate fish or appropriate fish to yourself by the initiative," Treadwell said.  "So that's why we ruled it out of order."On Tuesday afternoon, the two sides met in Superior Court to plead their case, with a decision expected within the next 60 days.If the state’s decision is overturned by the court, supporters of the initiative will begin gathering signatures with the hopes of putting on the August 2016 primary ballot.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such as heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating more fiber and lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number you burn off in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Weight in Pounds(Height in inches) x (Height in inches)Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such as depression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems with pregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, and influenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to the age of 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.iStock/toranicoFind out how slow-growing prostate cancer is treated.iStock/moneybusinessimagesLearn different ways to cope with a new prostate cancer diagnosis here.iStock/artmannwitteFind out how hormone therapy can be used against prostate cancer.iStock/svanhornWhile there's no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, there are things you can do to reduce your risk.iStock / digitalskilletA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test can check men for the signs of prostate cancer.

"Maybe sometime in the future we could co-exist, but right now I think it's really scary."Chandler Anspach says she's encountered bears on different occasions over the years and people just need to take the right precautions when they see one and give the bears space."I was really disappointed just because we are a state, I think, that we really paramount on knowing just our environment and being in touch with nature," Anspach said. "It's just really sad that we had to go to extreme measures when I really think it could have been prevented just with simple awareness."Coltrane says after contacting the Municipality of Anchorage's Department of Parks and Recreation earlier in the week about the problem, officials acted quickly to add bear-resistant garbage cans to Goose Lake and Tikishla Park.Parks and Recreation says there are currently 40 bear-resistant containers placed across city parks noted as "high activity" areas.While many people have strong feelings about the death of the sow, it's a lesson Fish and Game says could save a life in the future.Parks and Recreation says it has ordered eight more bear-resistant containers because of the higher activity this year, and it will continue working with Fish and Game to identify problem spots.The cubs are currently being cared for at the Alaska Zoo, and officials say they'll eventually be transferred to a facility in the Lower 48.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Eating a healthful diet helps keep your body strong and can help reduce your risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and osteoporosis. Studies even show a link between healthful eating and longevity."As we age, the body becomes less efficient at absorbing some key nutrients. Appetite and taste can suffer from loss of sense of smell and taste or from side effects of medications. Bad teeth can make some foods difficult to chew or digest," said Arthur Hayward, MD, a geriatrician and the clinical lead physician for elder care with Kaiser Permanente's Care Management Institute. "So choosing foods carefully is smart."Here are five tips to help you get the nutrition your body needs:1. Avoidempty calories.Foods with empty calories may contain very few vitamins and minerals. "Convenience foods," such as packaged snacks, chips and sodas, are common sources of empty calories. Avoid the "bad" carbs -- foods that have white flour, refined sugar and white rice.2. Choose nutrient-rich foods.Eat a variety of foods. The more you vary the foods you eat, the more vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you get. For example:* Eat lots of fruits and vegetables -- Choose fresh, frozen or no-salt canned vegetables and fruits in their own juice or light syrup.* Eat foods with protein -- Protein is found in lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs and cheese, cooked beans, peanut butter and nuts and seeds.* Get enough calcium and vitamin D -- Calcium and vitamin D are found in milk and milk products, including yogurt and cheese. They are also in green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens) and tofu.* Include foods high in vitamin B12 -- After 50, the body produces less gastric acid and absorbs less B12, which helps keep blood and nerves vital. B12 is found in milk, meat, poultry, fish and eggs.* Eat high-fiber foods -- This includes fruits, vegetables, cooked dried beans and whole grains.3. Drink plenty of fluids.Drink plenty of fluids -- enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water. Fiber and fluids help with constipation.4. If your appetite is poor.Try eating smaller meals, several times a day, instead of one or two large meals. Eating while socializing with others may help your appetite. You might also ask about changing medicines. Medication can cause appetite or taste problems.5. Eat soft foods.As we approach our senior years, chewing food is sometimes difficult. Choose low-sodium canned vegetables or cooked fruits and vegetables. These are often softer. Chop or shred meat, poultry or fish. Add sauce or gravy to the meat to help keep it moist.In addition to eating a balanced diet, aim for 150 minutes of physical activity each week. Ten-minute sessions several times a day on most days are fine. For questions or advice about a specific condition, talk with your physician.No email address was supplied by.

Adams' family members were notified of their disappearance Thursday.<COL>Relatives of Missing Kenai Residents Expand Search EffortsWhile the Kenai Police Department and the FBI continue to search in the area where four missing people were last seen, the family of Rebecca Adams and her two children are expanding their search beyond that.Kenai is already covered with posters with the names, age and physical descriptions of those missing -- Rebecca Adams, 22, her daughters Michelle Hundley, 5, and Jaracca Hundley, 3, and Rebecca’s boyfriend Brandon Jividen, 37.Four family members were still out in force around the peninsula Tuesday, however, posting flyers and talking to locals, hoping anyone with any information may lead to clues as to their loved ones' whereabouts.Rebecca’s mother Jeanini Adams, aunt Kim Gifford, sister Lanell Adams and uncle Dennis Gifford were in Cooper Landing Tuesday. They also made stops in Soldotna and Nikiski.“Sometimes they’d come up here (Cooper Landing) and go fishing or camping; we just want to find them and bring them home safe,” Jeanini Adams.“We’re just trying to get the word out wherever we can, so it doesn’t just go off and fade away; it’s out there so people will see it and not forget,” Kim Gifford said.As the search continues, Kenai Police Department Chief Gus Sandahl held a briefing at the Kenai Public Library Tuesday afternoon to inform the public on the latest details from law enforcement."The last physical evidence we have of a sighting for Rebecca (Adams) and her two girls was on May 18," Sandahl said, noting that they were seen in surveillance video at a local commercial center.Kenai police are continuing their search efforts by expanding out from the wooded area behind the family's residence, based on recent leads.Despite continued efforts from state and federal agencies, with the FBI officially acknowledging its involvement in the search Tuesday and information from the public trickling in, officials still haven't narrowed down the whereabouts of the missing.At the end of the press conference, Sandahl told a reporter he remains hopeful of finding the missing family; another reporter subsequently asked him why."Just because I have no reason not to be," Sandahl said.The Kenai Police Department will hold another briefing to inform the public on the latest developments Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Kenai Public Library.KPD asks anyone with any information that lead to clues into their investigation to contact them at 907-283-7879.Channel 2's Blake Essig contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

If you or your kids are heading into the classroom every day -- or if you just want to perform better at work or in general -- incorporate these eight kid-friendly foods into your daily diet rotation:WalnutsOmega-3 fatty acids are important for healthy brain function and memory. If you’ve ever read anything about nutrition, you know that salmon is a great source, but good luck trying to get your kid to eat salmon for lunch. Walnuts are also chock-full of omega-3s, and they come with a lot less nose-wrinkling and complaints.OatmealThe studies are in -- breakfast reallyisthe most important meal of the day. Studies have shown that students who eat before hitting the classroom consistently perform better than those who don’t. And there’s no better morning superstar than oatmeal. These whole grains contain vitamin B6, which is essential for enhancing short-term memory and attention span.AlmondsTrue story: I woke up in a daze this morning, and two cups of coffee didn’t improve the situation. You know what did? A serving of almonds. These nuts helps fight brain fog so you can focus on the task at hand (in my case, writing about brain foods for Pure Matters). As an added bonus, they also improve mood, making them a great snack choice for moody teenagers who can’t focus because they have So. Many. Feelings.AvocadosIf your blood flow is hindered, your brain can’t do all of the things it needs to do. The good fats in avocado keep everything moving along, ensuring that you’re awake, alert and focused. I didn’t need another reason to eat guacamole every chance I get, but I’m happy to have one.BlueberriesAll berries fall into the superfood category, and with good reason. High in fiber, full of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory… the list goes on and on. I’d hate to malign strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, but it seems that blueberries are just a little bit more super, especially when it comes to improving your memory.Flax SeedsI am a firm believer that just about everyone needs flax seeds in their lives. They keep your cardiovascular system humming along; they help fight cancer and chronic inflammation; and they can do wonders for your digestion. On the brain front, they keep your mind sharp by helping the cerebral cortex process information. And while kids may turn their noses up at the mention of flax seeds, they are easy to grind up and sneak into smoothies, yogurt, cereals and baked goods. I won’t tell if you don’t.EggsEggs are one of the best sources of choline, an amino acid which is an important nutrient for memory and learning. The choline is in the yolk, though, so if you’re one of those people who asks for egg whites, you’re missing out on an important brain food, not to mention all of the egg’s antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins.YogurtCalcium helps nerve function, which is essential for a healthy brain. Yogurt is one of the best ways to get this nutrient, both due to the good bacteria it contains, and the amino acids which help improve alertness and memory.Kid-Friendly Meal IdeasBreakfast:Lunch:Snacks:Source: Pure MattersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

DNR claims it will make the permitting process more efficient for companies or individuals who want to build industrial projects.  Officials say there is a large backlog of those permit applications."I think what this is taking away from us our voice, and our ability to manage our own resources,” said Dillingham resident Thomas Tilden.Tilden was in Juneau to testify against the bill.  He’s afraid it would open up the floodgates for development upstream from Bristol Bay area villages and cut off water to salmon habitat.Sen. Peter Micciche (R-Soldotna) says he heard feedback from his constituents over the summer, many of whom are opposed to the current bill. Micciche offered several amendments to the bill. One amendment would restore the rights of individual Alaskans and federally recognized tribes in Alaska to apply for water reservations."To protect those who have an actual physical effect from projects and to separate those who have a philosophical opposition to development,” Micciche said.Another amendment would remove broad authority from DNR's commissioner in handling appeals to permits.Micciche says he hopes the committee will vote on his amendments next week.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Officials apparently chased her down for accepting a North Pole pin someone gifted to her.McCarthy was quoted in the WSJ article published March 6, saying "I threw the f-ing thing away."In the article, McCarthy continued on about a jar of moose meat that "could gag a maggot."Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the comments were surprising."This is not coming from some random bureaucrat who's never been to Alaska, this was from a Cabinet secretary," Murkowski said.Murkowski called McCarthy's comments were a mistreatment of Alaska's culture."What is more part of our culture than the foods that our Alaska Native peoples eat, whether it is moose or whether it is salmon?" Murkowski said. "Sometimes smoked salmon doesn't smell that appealing to other people, but it is a rich resource for us and it just demonstrates, again, a lack of understanding -- it was an unforgivable statement, I think."Rep. Don Young said in a written statement, "Gina McCarthy's words sound like they come from someone who has contempt for, rather than an appreciation of the rich customary traditions of Alaska's people."EPA spokesperson Mark MacIntyre issued a written statement on McCarthy's words Friday."McCarthy has offered her heartfelt apology to her hosts for some unfortunate remarks she made to the press recently regarding gifts she received while visiting Alaska," MacIntyre wrote. "She was truly humbled by the kindness, warmth and hospitality shown to her throughout the trip and insists that she meant no disrespect."Sen. Mark Begich said the apology was a step in the right direction."She was quick to recognize her mistake the way she described the food and I think that's a first sign, but at the end of the day we need people to understand that Alaska is not like New York, it's not Massachusetts, it's not like California," Begich said. "It's a very unique state that has very unique challenges."In his statement, MacIntyre emphasized McCarthy's previous association with American Indians across the country."During her address at the recent National Congress of American Indians, Administrator McCarthy underscored her deep appreciation for the cultural value of gift giving, reconfirmed her commitment to strengthening partnerships between EPA and native people throughout Indian Country and emphasized her respect for the ‘important government-to-government relationship we share,’” MacIntyre wrote.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

His greatest professional passion was the give-and-take that occurs inside a courtroom, the challenge of arguing a complex case, the rush of successfully representing a client.How could that continue when the hearing loss he suffered degraded to full-blown deafness?And doctors for a long time knew nothing except the obvious: something was wrong with his hearing, and it was getting worse.In 2007, when Ray was in his fifties, the noise became a constant cacophony of high-pitched ringing, screeching, something like an idling airplane engine: no more words.“I would be less than honest if I said that it wasn't frustrating,” he said. He shrugged his shoulders, and his head shook side to side.For a moment he thought seriously of early retirement, but instead he settled on a less certain, more difficult path: he decided to find a way to stay at work.He learned to read lips, and he learned that specialized court reporters can provide realtime translation, so that nothing is lost .In an ordinary court hearing, the reporter enters sworn testimony into the official record. Realtime translators write every word spoken in a courtroom, whether from sworn testimony or a member of the public attending a hearing, and the words are transmitted constantly to a series of screens. To attain the certification, one must type at least 200 words per minute with 96 percent accuracy. In action the process looks something like a teleprompter run by hands that move as fast as those of a concert pianist.“I would wager that a significant percentage of Alaska judges don’t hear as well as the reporters I have,” he said. “With that I knew I could interact with the legal community – witnesses, jurors, all that. My concern was whether clients would be a little concerned.”As it turned out, Ray was preceded by his reputation as an expert on coastal matters, and his practice continued to thrive.DEAF JUSTICEA seat on the Bethel bench of the Alaska Superior Court opened up in 2012.Ray submitted an application to become one of two Superior Court judges serving the Fourth Judicial District, an area composed of a huge stretch of rural Alaska that stretches from the Canadian border across the interior to Bethel. The Alaska Judicial Council graded Ray's application as the best submitted, and it was one of four forwarded to Gov. Sean Parnell.The Republican spent many years working as a lawyer before entering politics and remembers interacting with Ray in court.“I had the chance many years ago to spend about a week in Glennallen on a case that Chuck Ray was a part of,” Parnell said. “He was a very competent, qualified attorney and just a ‘salt of the earth’ kind of guy.”To be successful as a judge responsible for settling the most serious crimes that occur in a land area about the size of Oregon, it is imperative for a judge to understand the state and emphasize with all types of people, Parnell said.Before Ray entered the white-collar world, he followed a path not taken by many who apply to become one of the state’s leading judge.When he was a young man and a student at Stanford University, Ray made his way north to Alaska to work on a fishing boat in Cordova “for a summer.” He wound up fishing the Gulf of Mexico and returned to Alaska for several years to continue working on the water.“I ended up commercial fishing in one way or another for about 10 years,” Ray said. “I fished all over the Alaska coast, some in Washington, out the Bering Sea, way out the chain, crab fishing for a number of years. I salmon fished, tendered, did it all.”Fishing for Ray was a fun job that paid for his undergraduate studies and for a law degree, and it also led to a career not too distant from the waters he once fished.The mix of legal expertise, life experience and a wholehearted embrace of rural life and traditions made Ray a clear-cut favorite for the seat in Parnell’s view, and he was appointed to serve the Fourth District.Ray is the first deaf judge in the state's history and one of the only deaf trial judges in the world.The historic move prompted predictable questions from the legal community and Juneau lawmakers, with two concerns driving many conversations during the 2013 legislative session: Can a judge effectively control a courtroom without hearing? And at what cost?‘LIKE ANY OTHER JUDGE’David Henderson is a Bethel defense lawyer who often appears in Judge Ray’s courtroom."I think one of the big concerns when Judge Ray came to the bench was that there would be big delays, that hearings would take forever. How could someone with a hearing impairment conduct a courtroom?"The answer surprised Henderson and many others."What I found when I first appeared in front of him, it was remarkable. It went just like I was in front of any other judge," Henderson said. “You forget he’s deaf.”Many others across the local justice system offered a similar assessment of Ray’s performance, and it is easy to understand why. He more or less fully retains his voice and has no trouble communicating verbally with lawyers, defendants or anyone else.Ray said the difference is a supportive group of people around him and that he has access to the best tools offered by modern technology. “With the proper setup, it’s not an issue.”The cornerstone of the proper setup is a well-designed system of computers, screens and microphones, operated by certified realtime translators. They come to Bethel at a high price.Realtime translators in the United States number in the hundreds – four in Alaska and a handful on the West Coast. The going rate elsewhere ranges from $90 to $140 per hour, but like many other things, the price is higher in Bethel.Initial setup and first-year personnel expenses cost the state court system $456,800, and the court system set aside $365,000 to cover recurring costs in Fiscal Year 2015. That covers the salaries of realtime translators and their travel and lodging expenses as they filter in and out of Western Alaska in two-week increments, a majority coming up from California and Nevada.Governor Parnell said that is an acceptable price to pay to get the right man for the job.“I've treated the selection of judges with great sincerity and seriousness because these appointments will last much longer than a governor is in office,” Parnell said.Judge Ray said he is too busy to give much thought to criticism of his work or his path to the job, and he instead focuses on the constant flow of cases that arise in the state’s busiest judicial district. But he does hope people measure him the same as his colleagues.“If there are issues about the quality of what I do, I hope they're only the same concerns that people would express about any other trial judge.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

In his view, however, the case turned on whether the borough initiative could countermand the state’s regulatory authority over mines -- a conclusion he denied, noting that state lawmakers have granted the Department of Natural Resources “charge of all matters affecting the mineral resources of the state.”“By so definitively conferring gatekeeper permitting authority upon DNR, the Legislature impliedly prohibited local governments from assuming a concurrent role,” Suddock wrote. “Such a grant of power to local governments would Balkanize state natural resource policy.”Pebble spokesperson Mike Heatwole hailed the decision in a brief email to Channel 2 early Wednesday night."(The) main point is that the court held that the state gets to evaluate and decide on Pebble via its rigorous permitting process," Heatwole wrote.Channel 2's Mallory Peebles contributed information to this story.This is a developing story.

After a request from the state and the Pebble Partnership, it announced it would give them a 45-day extension to make their case against regulation in the first part of the review, under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.Even with the extension, Pebble Partnership spokesperson Mike Heatwole says it's heading into uncharted waters."What we've sought is more clarity from the EPA on, 'OK, what exactly do you want to see from Pebble?'" Heatwole said. "We have not filed an application yet to any agency to develop a project for Pebble. We have not released a mine plan."The state confirms no official permit plan has been filed.Ruth Hamilton Heese, a senior assistant to Alaska Attorney General Michael Geraghty, says without an official plan the EPA would be basing its decision off hypothetical situations."We don't even known what's being proposed because we don't have anything other than the EPA hypotheticals," Heese said. "It's very difficult to speak to the EPA's proposed actions."Channel 2 asked the EPA for an interview about what it would base its review on, but the agency said no one was available. Instead, the EPA issued a written statement saying the review will incorporate any information the state or Pebble provide, as well as its own watershed assessment and Pebble's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."EPA used this information to develop realistic mining scenarios that describe the potential impacts of mining on the salmon fishery," the statement read in part.With so little currently known about Pebble's actual shape, the state says the EPA review violates due process."I mean, we don't even have permit applications," Heese said. "We haven't even said we would permit the mine and I think that should alarm other states for any sort of project, whether it's public or private."Geraghty’s office says while it hasn't made a decision on whether the mine is or is not a good idea, it agrees with Pebble that the permit process must be protected.If the EPA does not impose any restrictions on mining in the Bristol Bay Area. Heatwole says Pebble would still need to acquire 60 permits to make the mine a reality.In a late development Wednesday, state Superior Court Judge John Suddock ruled that the state's authority to regulate mining trumps that of local boroughs,including a 2011 Lake and Peninsula Borough initiative intended to limit large-scale Bristol Bay mining projects.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"He had no hesitation to tell anybody what the rules were."Sauder says it will be difficult to visit the kitchen at Bean's knowing he won't be there anymore."He was really kind of our master of filleting salmon and cutting up salmon steaks," Sauder said.Sauder says Jack seemed to always know what to do to help."I always jokingly called him the Energizer Bunny because it seemed like he was always moving," Sauder said. "He was one of those client volunteers that you never had to ask him to do something."Jack also lived at Karluk Manor for the past two years, and had recently celebrated his 59th birthday. Kenny Scollan, division manager for the supportive housing division at Karluk Manor operator RurAL CAP, says he had also purchased a brand new La-Z-Boy chair for his room."He was so happy about getting his chair that he was going to use it as a bed and not sleep in his bed anymore," Scollan said. "It was electric and it folded up and down."Jack never had an opportunity to sit in his new chair."He left at about 6 o'clock (Wednesday) and said he would see everybody later and the next thing we heard was that he had passed," Scollan said."We love him and we miss him," Sauder said.Jack's cause of death was unknown as of Friday. APD says it's found no obvious signs of foul play.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The state adopted both proposals last week.“It won't be a free-for-all, 'Everybody go get fish,' but (we) worked out some solutions to where people will have an opportunity to get fresh fish,” said the working group's co-chair, Beverly Hoffman.But the question of who should be allowed to fish is also being discussed. The Napaskiak Tribal Council has asked the Federal Subsistence Board to limit king salmon harvest on the river to qualified subsistence users, those who live off the fish and reside in qualifying areas.“Life is hard in rural Alaska, where we depend on what we catch and what we prepare during summer months to feed and keep our families fed,” said Napaskiak Tribal Council Administrator Stephen Maxie.The idea is to restrict Alaskans from urban areas from fishing the river for kings. The federal government cannot restrict fishing based on ethnicity.“The only way we can limit access is based on residency, in rural versus urban,” said Gene Peltola Jr. with the Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Subsistence Management.Hoffman predicts another decade of tough management decisions on the Kuskokwim River.“There are going to be people not happy," Hoffman said. "I'm hoping that wiser minds will prevail."The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Subsistence Regional Advisory Council will hold a meeting and public hearing in Bethel next week to discuss restricting who can fish for kings on the Kuskokwim River.In Anchorage, the state is refining its management strategy for the Kuskokwim River, which it says may be finalized as early as the end of the week.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Keeping local resources intact is an issue that unites Akiak's Mike Williams Sr. -- chief of the Yupiit Nation -- with members of NCAI, a group of 562 tribal nations which are pushing through a resolution to restore hunting, fishing, and land rights to tribes including Alaska Natives."We are ready to help to make sure our fish don't deplete; we have never depleted the resource," Williams said.The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs is considering giving tribes more control over traditional lands -- including sacred ground returned this week to the Native Village of Eklutna."I hope you all understand what just happened here," Lee Stephan, the village's vice chief, told Eklutna residents on Sunday. "Your village is now given back; it's intact, it's yours."NCAI President Brian Cladoosby says the Eklutna repatriation is an example of what member tribes hope to see across the nation."They just want what they've always had -- it's sad that they can't go out and get the traditional foods that their ancestors have lived on," Cladoosby said. "Tribes were here when you got here, and tribes will be here when you're gone."Leaders within the congress now hope to teach elected officials the ways of Indian country, in an effort to share the indigenous perspective with them."The majority of (tribal members) don't have what we take for granted -- running water, indoor plumbing, electricity," Cladoosby said."We need to have that working relationship with respect, to get out of the courts and actually work together," Williams said.Although the NCAI resolutions haven't made it into legislation, the organization says progress is getting made. President Obama will be the first president to visit Indian country in 15 years when he goes to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota on Friday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

High tide was listed at 7:13 p.m., flowing out to a low tide at 1:35 a.m. Thursday.Dennis advises anyone using the inlet for fishing to remember to bring a cell phone, life preservers and travel in pairs.“It’s a dangerous place and treat it like it is,” Dennis said. “It is part of the wilderness and the wonderful thing about Alaska.”Channel 2's Kenny Knutson and Garrett Turner contributed to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

This summer bears have become a frequent sight across Anchorage, raising concerns among the city's homeless population.People who live in homeless camps say they’ve seen bears around Davis Park almost daily. But they say they aren’t concerned with their campsites as much as they are about the children and people who frequently visit the area.“I’ve been fighting the same bear for almost three years,” said Randall Lorraine, who camps by Davis Park.Lorraine has been living in camps in the woods by the area for a couple of years now -- but he says he’s never seen as much bear activity in the area as he has this summer.“It’s far worse then the last two years, and they were pretty bad,” Lorraine said.Lorraine and his dog Ginger have jumped from campsite to campsite a lot this year, because he says bears have attacked each new site one after another.“Nothing scares them,” said James Hood, another person who camps in the area. “I’ve had four tents the bear has destroyed just this year.”But for Hood, it’s not so much about the bears ripping through his home as it is about the dozens of kids who play in the area. Many residents have seen a black bear sow and two cubs in town over the summer, including frequent June sightings in the city's U-Med district.“I don’t mind the bears, but I’m getting the feeling that she’s going to end up hurting somebody sooner or later and that’s what I’m worried about,” Hood said.Officials with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game say it’s not uncommon for black bears to be seen in urban areas this time of year. They said they won’t intervene unless bears show aggression towards humans.But for those living in the woods by Davis Park think that if something isn’t done about the bears soon, it could be too late.“Everyone thinks it’s funny, what they don’t realize that it’s got three cubs on the other side of her, and if you make her mad she’s going to go right through you -- especially with kids with backpacks full of food,” Hood said.According to the state, the Municipality of Anchorage has between 250 to 350 black bears. Although it may seem like common sense, Fish and Game advise that if you spot a bear, simply keep a safe distance between you and the bear.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

She’s a bear, she's a wild animal, and she has two cubs.”And that means people need to back off, Coltrane said. “If you want a picture, take a telephoto lens,” she said.Another problem is unsecured trash cans in nearby neighborhoods and at the park, though the latter could soon be replaced.Coltrane said there is usually an uptick of bear activity in Anchorage in July and that this year is not particularly unusual.UAA is open and operating on schedule, and APD spokesperson Anita Shell said officers are no longer at Goose Lake Park.An example of the baton round deployed by the Anchorage Police Department.

One card to draw today? Omega-3 fatty acids. Here's how these good-for-you fats can help boost your heart health ... and how to take in enough to stack the deck in your favor.So Many Ways Omega-3s Help Heart HealthExperts believe that omega-3s can prevent heart disease in healthy people and slow its progress in people who already have it. The short version of the omega-3 connection to the heart: Over time, plaque can build up in your arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow through. Eventually, the channels can become so narrow that a blood clot or loose piece of plaque can get stuck, blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack. Inflammation (swelling) can also narrow the arteries, raising your heart attack risk.Enter omega-3s: Research shows that these fatty acids slow the growth of artery plaque. They also help prevent both inflammation and blood clots, and they can positively affect certain risk factors associated with heart disease or heart attack—namely, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and abnormal heartbeat.Stacking Your Diet with Omega-3sExperts have found that people who eat foods with high levels of two omega-3 fatty acids -- EPA and DHA -- have low rates of heart disease. These omega-3s are found in fatty fish such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon. The American Heart Association recommends eating some type of fatty fish at least twice a week. Another source for EPA and DHA is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Foods rich in ALA include flaxseed, walnuts and other nuts, and soy, canola, and flaxseed oils. You can try adding these foods to your weekly diet.Worried that you're not getting enough of these nutrients through diet alone? One easy way to boost your intake is through a daily supplement that contains EPA and DHA. In fact, the American Heart Association says that people who already have heart disease should take 1 gram of a supplement of EPA and DHA every day. If you have high triglycerides, you can take 2 to 4 grams a day. (A blood test can determine if this is true for you.) Ask your doctor how many grams of omega-3s would be best for you, and take it to heart.Source: Pure MattersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Find out what such a diet entails.<COL>iStock / adlifemarketingAccording to the American Heart Association, a healthy diet can help alleviate three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess body weight.The AHA recommends a balanced diet that includes foods from all the major food groups but emphasizes fruits, vegetables and grains.Fruits And VegetablesThe AHA advises that people eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Not only do these foods contain vitamins, minerals and fiber, they're usually low in calories. That can help you lose weight or make maintaining your weight easier.Breads, Cereal, Grains And PastaA healthy heart diet includes at least six servings of grain products, according to the AHA. Keep in mind that starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn and peas are included in this group.Grains are often low in fat and cholesterol and high in fiber. In fact, oats contain high amounts of soluble fiber, which has been shown to lower cholesterol.Dairy ProductsAdults should include three or more servings of low-fat dairy products in their daily diet. Children should have two or more servings, and teens and older adults need four or more servings every day.It's important to choose low-fat dairy products, the AHA says, because milk fat is high in saturated fats that can raise cholesterol levels.Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, EggsThe AHA recommends eating no more than 6 ounces of cooked, lean meat, fish or poultry each day. Poultry should be eaten without the skin and meat should be trimmed of as much fat as possible.The American Dietetic Association suggests including fatty fish in your diet. Fish like salmon, tuna, herring or sardines are rich in a type of fatty acid called omega-3, which thins the blood and makes blood cells less "sticky" and less likely to clot and cause a heart attack. Both the AHA and the ADA suggest you include fatty fish in your diet at least twice a week.Diet Can Help Lower High Blood PressureYour diet can also help keep your blood pressure low. The AHA suggests eating less than 2,400 milligrams of sodium a day. Keep in mind that many prepared foods contain high amounts of sodium.Alcohol consumption should be limited to one drink a day for women and no more than two drinks a day for men.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Alaska’s congressional delegation will work with the governor’s office to allocate the relief to affected groups throughout the state.The low returns of Chinook salmon resulted in a continuation of the Yukon River commercial fishery failure from 2010 through 2012, as well as a Kuskokwim River commercial fishery failure from 2011to 2012. The Cook Inlet fishery failure came in 2012.Commerce officials say the state has “broad latitude” in deciding how it will use the funds toward the goal of “(restoring) the fishery or (preventing) a similar failure in the future and to assist a fishing community affected by such failure.”Sen. Lisa Murkowski credited a “Coastal Coalition” of 38 Congressional representatives working for fisheries relief with securing the money. The disaster areas include fisheries in New England, the Gulf Coast, and Alaska.“When the Coastal Coalition was able to secure $75 million (in total funding) … that was the beginning of negotiations to make sure Alaska got its fair share,” Murkowski wrote in a statement. “Getting more than a quarter of that total for our state will assist thousands of Alaskans who were affected.”The $75 million total came from Commerce officials working through NOAA, and used commercial fishery revenue loss as the common factor to calculate how much each disaster area would receive.“It is the metric generally used to determine whether a commercial fishery failure has occurred (and) this metric is common among (all) disasters and is readily available,” said Robert Moller, Deputy Director of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs under NOAA.Moller wrote in a release that spending can cover commercial or recreational fisheries, support industries like fish processors, as well as funds directly to communities affected by fisheries disasters.He noted that past funding had been used for direct payments to fishermen, infrastructure projects, habitat restoration, vessel and permit buybacks and job retraining.NOAA Alaska spokesperson Julie Speegle said it's still unknown how the money will be spent in Alaska or when funds will be used in projects or payments.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The high-fat, high-salt American diet is largely to blame: It's easier to eat junk than reaching for a healthy alternative.The deeper cause for heart disease is low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that delivers cholesterol around the body and high sodium, which raises both blood pressure and the chance of heart attacks and strokes.It's no fun to cut out salty snacks and red meat, but tasty alternatives can help you stay proactive about heart health without eating boiled chicken and rice cakes.If health isn't your hot button, simply eating better can also save cash. Turkey is certainly cheaper than steak, and a good diet can help negate the need for expensive high-cholesterol medication.Check out five easy alternatives that can go a long way ...No. 5: Soy nutsSnacking can be tough when you're keeping heart health in mind, but getting that crunchy fix is still possible without saying goodbye to flavor.Studies show that nuts lower the level of bad LDL cholesterol, and even lower the risk of developing blood clots. Nuts are also packed with fiber and heart-healthy vitamin E.Soy nuts might not sound like something satisfying to munch on, but, prepared right, they can give you a crunchy snack fix without munching on high-sodium or high-fat snacks.Instead of reaching for chips, toast some soy nuts with Italian herbs and some olive oil. And instead of salty nuts, try some toasted soy nuts with a dusting of sea salt. Taco seasoning can also give soy nuts a little bit of spice.Mixing those soy nuts with almonds or walnuts can make for a very satisfying medley that doesn't carry the high fat or high sodium of chips and dip.No. 4: TurkeyThe old way of heart-healthy eating meant sad, flavorless boiled chicken and white rice -- yuck.But no more. With countless cuts of turkey in your grocery store, you can get away from those tired chicken breasts without reaching for red meat.Burgers are the best, but getting that grill fix and staying healthy can be tricky.Ground turkey, however, can be a great alternative for heart health that will still give you something to eat at the weekend barbecue.You can spice it up with good herbs and grill it with olive oil. Pop some cheese on top for the whole package -- just stick to part-skim or a little high-flavor, small-serving gourmet cheese.Turkey can also replace beef in spaghetti sauces to get a little more flavor beyond the vegetarian sauce snoozer. Get it ground or chop it roughly for a chunky meat sauce.No. 3: FishGoing without red meat is the No. 1 thing you can do to stay on top of your heart health. But going without a good steak can get awfully boring, and turkey just doesn't cut it sometimes.So if you're looking for a big hearty meal, try a good size piece of salmon and some roast veggies. You'll get that big meat feeling, and plenty of taste, but instead of gristly beef fat, you're getting healthy omega-3 fatty acids.While replacing all your meat with salmon might get expensive, other fish are also packed with those healthy fats. Trout and herring are great places to find those good fatty acids.iStock / adlifemarketingA healthy diet can help alleviate three major risk factors for heart disease.

The EPA is taking 1 year to decide if it will use it's power to halt any mining in the bristol bay area to protect the fishery.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking the first steps toward possibly restricting or even prohibiting development of a massive gold-and-copper prospect near the headwaters of a world-premier sockeye salmon fishery in southwest Alaska.The EPA says it will use section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to assess the effects of mining the Pebble deposit. The agency will use the act to review "potential adverse environmental effects of discharges of dredged and fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit."The review is due to the EPA's stated belief that "copper mining of the scale contemplated at the Pebble deposit would result in significant and unacceptable adverse effects to important fishery areas in the watershed."A release from EPA on Friday says the review will only assess the effects of the proposed Pebble Mine and "will not consider other mining or non-mining related development in the watershed."Permits would not be issued during the roughly year-long review process, EPA officials said.If the EPA’s review finds Pebble’s mining discharges “unacceptable” under the act, the EPA will “determine whether and how to establish restrictions to protect” the watershed from “adverse effects.”EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Friday that the Clean Water Act review is something the EPA “doesn’t do often, but Bristol Bay is worthy of extraordinary agency actions to protect it.”McCarthy said the EPA has initiated a Clean Water Act review 29 times in the past, and 13 times the review has resulted in restrictions.The federal agency will ask the state and those behind the proposed Pebble Mine to make their case for the project during the four stages of the CWA 404(c) review. Those stages would begin with a consultation with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers starting on Friday. The second stage of the review a publication of proposals and potential restrictions and a public comment period. Stage three will be a review of the public testimony and a development of a “determination” by EPA. The final stage of the process would end with a second consultation with the Army Corps and site owners, and a “final determination” of any prohibitions or restrictions on mining the Pebble deposit.An EPA report, released in January, found large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed posed significant risk to salmon.The action announced Friday is what Pebble supporters have feared. Mine opponents have urged EPA to take steps to protect the region.McCarthy says her agency is exercising its authority to ensure protection of the fishery from risks it faces "from what could be one of the largest open pit mines on earth."This is a developing story.

By that time a second call said the building was fully engulfed in flames.The fire was threatening to spread to nearby fuel tanks, but Berg said fire fighters kept the flames at bay. Several hours on scene left the building “burnt down to a manageable level” and firefighters returned to town, Berg said.The building is “a total loss,” along with a generator shed located nearby. No one was injured in the fire.The Crystal Lake Hatchery is part of the Southern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association Inc., a non-profit that promotes salmon fisheries, manages hatcheries, and runs other salmon enhancement projects in the region.SSRAA Production Manager Bill Gass said the fire is bad news, but “timing was a little bit of a silver lining.”With an incubation capacity of two millions eggs or sac fry juveniles, Gass said slightly over half of this year’s batch of king salmon were still in the incubation unit at the time of the fire.“We got a portion of that production outside. If this had happened two or three weeks ago, we would have lost everything. At least now we have some fish to move forward for next year,” Gass said.Revised numbers released Wednesday estimated the loss to be about a 700,000 Chinook juveniles or eggs, which he said would translate to about $700,000 million in lost revenue to southeast Alaska fishermen.In addition, Gass said about 200,000 coho eggs were also lost in the fire.For the Crystal Lake Hatchery, that’s more than half of the dollar value produced in fish each year, Gass said. With an average production of about $15 million a year throughout the SSRRA, Gass said the fire destroyed “as much as five percent” of the associations’ value.“For this facility, it’s a loss of well over half the value to the fishermen … (and is) affecting essentially every fishermen in the region, including sport fishermen,” Gass said.He added that the fish outside the building are fine and that SSRRA hopes to rebuild the incubation unit at Crystal Lake.There are enough fish on hand to take eggs this summer on schedule, Gass added.An assistant state fire marshal was in Petersburg for other business and is now on the scene investigating the cause of the blaze, which currently remains unknown.Editor's note: SSRAA staff say more than a million Chinook salmon eggs, not coho salmon eggs as initially reported, were destroyed in the fire. Only 200,000 coho eggs were lost. In addition, revised numbers brought the estimate of $1.2 million dollars in loss down to $700,000.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

One project in Anchorage seeks to help injured military personnel deal with life’s stresses.<COL>Fly Fishing Offers Alaska PTSD Veterans Recreation, PeaceJune 27 is national Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day, in conjunction with the entire month of June dedicated to PTSD awareness. One project in Anchorage seeks to help injured military personnel deal with life’s stresses.Project Healing Watersis a local non-profit organization that assists wounded military service members recover by teaching them fly fishing, an activity many find calming and peaceful, including veteran Manfred Aponte.“Freedom isn’t free” is a phrase Aponte knows only too well, a hard truth learned throughout his service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Two of Aponte’s friends gave their lives in the line of duty, and their memories are never far away for Aponte when he’s out on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson’s Green Lake.“My soldiers died doing their job, no matter what anybody says,” Aponte said.Aponte wears two bracelets with their names, to remind him to never forget their sacrifice. It's the kind of grief, Aponte says, which can stick with you no matter what you do.“Sometimes my wife gets mad because I don’t open up to her, even though she’s in uniform too,” Aponte said. “It’s different; I don’t know how to explain it.”But being out on the water gives Aponte a chance to be around others who can understand the sentiment and grief, like retired veteran Todd Green, who says his experience was “the best and worst thing that ever happened” to him.Green came to Alaska in 2004, after serving in Afghanistan. Two years later, he was redeployed to Iraq. After two deployments, Green’s body began to feel the effects of his time in the field, suffering from a traumatic brain injury and multiple muscle and ligament tears in his knee.“It's not that I had enough of the Army,” Green says of his retirement. “But it was time for me to step aside and let soldiers that I had trained before me to step in to my role.”Project Healing Waters has helped Green prepare for his next important life -- role as a father. When life’s stresses begin to eat at him, he takes to the water.“I have days where I have trouble coping with different stresses of my life,” Green said. “So if I have a bad day, I can grab my fly rod.”Green also sits with others at a fly-tying station designed to help them focus, an activity offered every Thursday by the project to military personnel.“It's not easy for me to talk to somebody in uniform, somebody that had been there before,” Aponte explained. “They didn't live what I lived. They know where I've been and I can tell them and release that pressure I had on myself. Honestly. I'm not thinking about anything at all, and that's one of the good points about it -- because someone with PTSD, they have a lot of intrusive thoughts or flashbacks.”Instead, the two retired soldiers and others like them sit back, finding comfort in nothing but the sound of those near them who have shared their struggle.Last year, Project Healing Waters’ Alaska staff provided 5,400 volunteer hours while helping 78 individuals. So far this year, the project has assisted 32 people.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

John has seen Circle’s population rise and fall much like the Yukon waters the village was established near. Of course, the particular shores of this arm of the Yukon were much narrower back when Circle was founded.For John, the village and its people represent serenity and a bastion of G’wichen culture housed within the community.Traditions endure. Some endure many would rather see diminish while others diminish many would rather see endure.For the former, John, like his neighbors have grown used to annual flooding. At the onset of the Yukon’s 2014 breakup, waters crept well beyond their typical shores and into the streets and homes of Circle. With any flood, the community of roughly 80 residents banded together to help those in need. Luckily the flooding wasn’t devastating, but damage remains.There is a way of life in Circle John would like seen preserved.John knows the culture of his village is threatened by the youth’s general disinterest in the cultural G’wichen language and traditions.“They’re the ones who are going to takeover,” John said. “We (the elders) won’t be here forever.”The language isn’t easy to learn, John admits, but there’s more to his village’s heritage than language, even though he knows its importance. It all starts at home, John believes. Whether it’s imparting the cultural teachings, teaching subsistence fishing and hunting, John feels it’s more than just preserving traditions. John sees a spiritual connection between the teachings his elders imparted on him and the youth he now passes on those traditions to.The village of Circle means more than providing roofs over residents’ heads. John believes Circle’s peaceful streets and scenic river vistas are worth preserving just as much as the cultural heritage the village represents.No email address was supplied by.

It's a long battle here, and there are probably a lot of issues,” said East Side Set Netter Brent Johnson.The current escapement range for early run kings on the Kenai River is between 5,300 and 9,000 fish.The board is expected to take up that issue as part of the Management Plan for the River on Wednesday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

What the new regulations hope to find is what the impact of fishing will have using shallower nets and if kings can really pass through them.Jim Butler, a set net fisherman on the Kenai said the decision is a lost opportunity and it’s something he’s still trying to understand.“There’s been no scientific method applied to making a determination on whether it makes a difference or not,” said Butler. “There have been studies in the past that have said you can’t measure it.”The hunt for trophy kings on the Kenai has built a lot of the areas businesses, but the declining number of kings on the Kenai River in the past 10 years has driven the economic value down.“When you stop and think that there is probably anywhere from $600 to $800 million on direct expenditures on sport fisheries in South Central, Alaska and 60 percent of sport fishing takes place in Cook Inlet, 60 percent of that is right out of the Kenai River,” said Delaney.“I like to think that there is a lot more to coming to Alaska than coming to one fishery and catching one type of fish,” said Butler.It’s a decision that will hopefully boost the number of runs but a decision that holds an unknown future for kings on the Kenai.The board’s decision Wednesday will be effective once the new regulations are finalized.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Last week committee members heard public testimony, where each speaker was given just three minutes to talk.In committee sessions, fishermen and other stake holders had more opportunities for conversation with board members, where they looked at specific proposals.Board Chair John Jensen has been on the board of fisheries for 12 years. He's also a commercial fishermen. Jensen said he's seen many of the same topics come up every year, but the shortage of king salmon have been a central theme this year."It's not just localized. It seems to be a state wide issue. They say it's ocean conditions and might be linked to this problem."Howard Delo, a member of the Mat-Su Fish and Wildlife Commission said the smaller groups allow for better conversation between different stake holders. He said, "It's a chance to the user groups to give more information they're looking for new stuff they haven't already heard. People can flesh out a little bit more why they made a proposal or why they're opposed to a proposal."The Board of Fisheries meeting will run through this Thursday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Staff at the group’s Anchorage called troopers in King Salmon.“The totes were inside a chain link enclosure and appeared to have been set on fire from outside the fence,” troopers wrote. “Each tote had a value of $1,000 and all ten totes were completely destroyed. Some of the wiring at the site was also damaged due to the heat from the fire.”In an email to Channel 2, AST spokesperson Megan Peters says the totes, on the leased site of the Pebble-owned incinerator, were large containers similar to those used for fish at canneries. One held a load of ash, while the others were empty; the resulting fire also melted a switch near the fence’s entrance gate.“Apparently locals put the fire out and left a message for the Iliamna trooper,” Peters wrote. “Now they are just bits of melted plastic.”Pebble Partnership spokesperson Mike Heatwole says crews which maintain the Iliamna incinerator first learned about the incident early on Feb. 1."They got a call in the morning that 'Hey, there's this big fire,'" Heatwole said.Heatwole described the burned containers as boxes about four feet square and three feet tall, used for taking trash to the incinerator. While he didn't immediately know if the containers were labeled as belonging to the Pebble Partnership, he says their ownership wasn't a secret."It's probably common knowledge that it was ours," Heatwole said.Peters says it’s not clear whether the containers were specifically targeted because of their owners.“It could just be someone wanted to burn something,” Peters said. “That happens a lot.”AST asks anyone with information on the case to call troopers in King Salmon at 246-3464 or Iliamna at 571-1871.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

To get the most out of your trip, follow these tips for fishing with kids.<COL>iStock / AlfskyMaking fishing a family event can be a fun adventure. To get the most out of your trip, follow these tips for fishing with kids.Make it about the kids:When fishing with kids – especially for their first couple of trips – you might not be hauling in a lot of fish. Try to be patient with the kids and make it an adventure for them, allowing them time to wade in the water, swim, look for insects, frogs and other creatures on the water.Teach the basic skills:When it’s time to focus on fishing, take it slow with the kids and teach them step-by-step what they need to do. Don’t bring your most expensive tackle. Bring tackle that you expect the kids to damage as they’re learning.Make it fun:Kids might get bored as they’re waiting for the fish to bite. Try to think of some games the kids can play while they are waiting to keep them engaged in the experience.Be prepared:Make sure to pack sunscreen, bug spray, water, snacks and extra layers of clothing.Be safe:Make sure adults supervise the kids at all times, especially around the fishing gear and hooks to prevent injuries. Also make sure everyone in the boat is wearing a life jacket at all times.No email address was supplied by.

The fish are safe to eat, but show telltale traces of the disaster.<COL>U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service | Creative CommonsA Seattle-based seafood company says independent testing has found “no indication” of radiation in their Puget Sound and Southeast Alaska salmon, even as two Alaska samples showed telltale “traces” linked to Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster.The March 2011 partial nuclear reactor failures in Fukushima, Japan have been the focus of Food and Drug Administration monitoring—and public scrutiny—since the disaster happened. During the crisis, radioactive material was released into the Pacific Ocean, igniting concerns of ecosystem damage and Pacific seafood stocks.The FDAsaid in a September updatethat there is “no evidence that radionuclides from the Fukushima incident are present in the U.S. food supply at levels that would pose a public health concern.”But Loki Fish Co. owner Peter Knutson said costumers continued to voice concerns over possible radiation in Pacific fish.That pushed the company to act.“What we did is go straight to an independent lab and got the analysis,” Knutson said. “Blowback” from customers “fueled by internet rumors” made paying for the tests “the ethical thing to do.”Five samples of Alaska fish caught near Prince of Wales Island and “within 100 miles of” Ketchikan in July and August of 2013 were tested by an independent lab. The samples included king, sockeye, keta/chum, pink, and coho/silver salmon.Samples of king and keta/chum salmon from Washington State’s Puget Sound were also tested.Testing was done by Eurofins Analytical Laboratories in Metaire, Lousiana, and cost Loki Fish Co. “about $1,200,” Knutson said.The tests looked for three radionuclides associated with the nuclear reactor failures: Cesium 134, Cesium 137, and Iodine 131. Levels of radiation are measured in becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg), a standard unit of radioactivity measuring “the number of particles decaying per second in each kilogram of a sample,” according to the U.C. Berkeley Department of Nuclear Engineering.Five of the seven samples had no detectable levels of any of the three radionuclides tested, measuring below 1 Bq/kg.Two Alaska samples were found to have “trace levels” of radionuclides: Alaska keta/chum salmon registered 1.4 Bq/kg for Cesium 137, while the sample of Alaska pink salmon measured 1.2 Bq/kg.“Those two samples registered something barely above normal,” Knutson said. “We’re at background levels that were internationally measured in the Pacific before Fukushima.”The FDA sets “Derived Intervention Levels” for common radionuclides. The DIL measurements are used “internationally” to measure radionuclide concentrations that would require “protective measures,” according to the FDA.TheFDA’s DIL measurementsfor Cesium 134 and 137 are 370 Bq/kg for imported foods, and 1,200 Bq/kg for domestic foods.That puts Alaska salmon at less than .1 percent of the FDA’s danger level of the Cesium radionuclides.Though the tests returned levels well below safety concerns, Knutson said the slight increase in Cesium levels is almost certainly traced back to Fukushima.Cesium 137 “is present in low-levels in the Pacific pre-Fukushima,” Knutson said, but increased levels of the substance were found in the Baltic and Black Seas after Chernoybl.  “Any (Cesium) 134 right now would have to be related to Fukushima … nuclear engineers say it’s only associated with the byproduct of a nuclear power accident,” he said.By June 2012, FDA import investigators had performed more than 32,000 field examinations for radionuclide contamination, testing 1,313 samples, including 199 seafood products.The FDA found 1,312 samples had no Iodine 131, Cesium 134, or Cesium 137 radionuclides. One sample was found to contain detectable levels of Cesium, but was below the established DIL.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

A total of $16.2 million in federal funds for the competitively selected projects, in 12 states and Puerto Rico, will be matched by $18.2 million from local governments, conservation groups and other interests.According to Jewell, the grants -- which range from $310,000 to $1 million each -- improve not only local fish and bird habitat but also water quality, storm surge preparedness and economies.“These grants, funded through excise taxes paid by anglers and boaters, give us the opportunity to join with states and territories and other partners to conserve and restore these areas that are so vital to our environment and our quality of life,” Jewell said in the statement.A list of the winning projects (PDF)on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's website indicates that the Alaska grant will help protect 2,585 acres of wetlands in five northeastern parcels of Afognak Island. The federal grant will receive a total match of $4,182,000 from other sources, as part of the first stage to cover unprotected parts of Perenosa Bay, as well as areas between the Kodiak Island National Wildlife Refuge and Afognak Island State Park.“Conservation of these lands will protect sensitive and declining coastal wetlands, estuarine and near shore habitat for Salmonids, (Steller) sea lions, and Steller eider,” officials wrote. “This project is supported by numerous conservation plans, including the USFWS Comprehensive Salmon Plan, and the ADNR Kodiak Area Plan.”Other jurisdictions receiving funds, raised under a Sport Fish Restoration Act tax on motorboats, small engine fuel and fishing equipment, include: Alabama, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Washington and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

If your cholesterol is high, consider using these suggestions to help you lower it.The Mayo Clinic suggests the first thing to do to lower your cholesterol is to lose weight.  The hospital states that carrying even a few extra pounds can affect your cholesterol.The Mayo Clinic suggests to start by making small changes -- like cutting back on fast-food items and adding more exercise into your daily routine.The next step is to try to eat more heart-healthy foods, the Mayo Clinic suggests. Eating healthier fats (lean meats, olive oil), cutting trans fats (fried foods, baked goods) from your diet and limiting the amount of cholesterol you are consuming are some ways to clean up your diet.To eat even healthier, eat whole grains and consume plenty of fruits and vegetables. You should also try to eat foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and almonds.The Mayo Clinic says that exercising can lower a person’s cholesterol – no matter their body size. Exercising will not only lower your “bad” cholesterol, but it will also raise your “good” cholesterol. The Mayo Clinic suggests – with a doctor’s approval – to exercise at least 30 minutes each day.Other ways to lower your cholesterol are to quit smoking and limit your alcohol intake.Medications can also help control your cholesterol.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Many opted instead to certify the sustainability of their catch through an alternative program known as Responsible Fisheries Management.Backed by ASMI, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, the RFM standard was a point of contention for Walmart, who said it would stop stocking Alaska seafood if it didn’t meet the MSC sustainability standards.Discussions on Alaska’s seafood sustainability led to state officials visiting Walmart’s Arkansas headquarters in September; Walmart officials continued the conversation in a visit to Juneau earlier this month.In its blog post, the company’s vice president of meat and seafood David Baskin wrote that the RFM certification caused Walmart to turn outside sustainability experts and “(take) another look at our policy.”“We’re pleased to incorporate the latest science by applying TSC’s principles to our sustainable seafood policy … ASMI is working with us to show how the RFM program meets these principles,” Baskin wrote.The decision comes as “vindication of Alaska’s seafood sustainability process,” said ASMI Communications Director.“This isn’t just about salmon, it’s about RFM certified seafood like Pollock, cod, halibut, crab, and more,” Fick said.Walmart’s decision was met by statements of support by Alaska representatives who had engaged with the retailer to keep Alaska salmon on its shelves.“Today's announcement from WalMart is clear vindication of our superior sustainable management practices. This is a significant step in confirming wild Alaska seafood as the benchmark for sustainability,” wrote Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in a release.“I have been calling on Walmart executives for months now to revise their sustainability policy,” Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) wrote in a release. “This is why I’m pleased that they have finally come full circle with a full reversal of their sustainability policies … to purchase Alaska seafood.”?Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That's second only to the $724 million harvest of 1988.State biologist David Harris says the pink salmon catch buoyed the 2013 numbers despite low figures for king salmon across the state.Tyson Fick with the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says the hefty harvest will be a financial boost for fisherman and Alaska's seafood industry as a whole.Fick says product diversification has led to increased uses pink salmon, which is not only canned but is often frozen.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Just last week, there was a rally in Seattle attended by fisherman worried about losing their jobs if the proposed mine were to happen.“When the EPA came out with the science, this has been three years, the EPA has used massive amounts of science that pebble themselves has produced and advertised that they’ve been studying for years and years,” said Brian Kraft, owner of 3 fishing lodges in Bristol Bay.Leaders from the fishing industry and representatives from the Bristol Bay region who attended Monday’s panel discussion say there’s a reason for the increased opposition.“I think talking to people all over Alaska this is an issue we’ve been dealing with for a long time and I think people are starting to make up their minds more and more,” said Katherine Carscallen, a commercial fisher in Bristol Bay.But CEO of Pebble Partnership, John Shively, thinks the EPA’s study was rushed and that the conclusion was just what could happen, not will happen if the mine were to go through.“We think people should wait, now our opposition wants EPA to move in, shut us down before we even get a permit,” said Shively.For now, the future of Pebble Mine is still unknown until the state issues a permit, but anti-Pebble Mine voices plan to grow louder and stronger.Meanwhile, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has not made any comments about Senator Begich’s position. She has criticized EPA for conducting the assessment based on a mine that hasn’t happened before any plan or permit hat been filed.Senator Murkowski said in a statement that she and her staff plan on continuing to review the full document.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Purple mountains and a cityscape with an old ramshackle house are in the background.It's beautiful and eye catching.The barista working when I stopped by last week told me the construction took about six months.

He said the only way to solve the problem is if all fishing groups pitch in."It's going to take all users, harvesters, resources to change some of their ways and depart it to this movement of bringing the runs back to health," Engel said.Orville Huntington, a member of the Board of Fisheries, said the board will be carefully considering the data presented on Friday.Huntington said one of the main concerns right now is how to return the Chinook salmon to a healthy population."A lot of the other salmon species are just fine, it's just the Chinook salmon in particular that really having a lot of problems," Huntington said.The deadline for people to testify was extended to 11 a.m. on Saturday. The board will take public testimony beginning Saturday morning.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They would meet back in the spot they left their truck.Jessica was excited to break in the new orange running shoes she bought to use in a half marathon, but her iPhone died the night before, so she ran with only the sounds of the forest: wind whispering through spruce and birch, ravens cawing, moose brushing around.Moments after her husband ran out of sight, a little after 11 a.m., just 20 minutes into the run, Sarah spotted something that brought her to a halt: a ball of fur on the horizon.“I saw a little cub right there, very close to the left side of the road,” Gamboa, a native of Sacramento, Calif., told Army Sgt. Eric-James Estrada in an interview from a hospital bed. “Immediately my thoughts were, where’s the mama bear?“If cubs are around, the mama bear’s not very far.”Soon thereafter the sow appeared and trotted her way. The rest was something of a blur.Despite assuming a posture she thought would convey her innocent intentions, the sow felt threatened and instincts kicked in. Jessica was bitten and clawed, and the grizzly clamped onto her buttocks and carried her across the trail and toward the cubs.“This is pretty much how I’m going to die, this is it,” she thought as she curled into the fetal position and played dead.But the sow, after an attack that spanned “several minutes,” sauntered away with her cubs in tow.Maj. Angela Webb, a JBER spokesperson, described what happened next as “heroic.”“The trauma she went through and the walk out was heroic,” Webb said.After laying and waiting to make sure the sow would not return, Jessica got up and made her way to a clearing. Her bright orange shoes took on a different meaning than they had a while earlier.“My first thought was get somewhere where you’re more visible,” she said. “Even if it was my last moments, at least I would be found more easily.”There was blood everywhere, pulsing from her neck, draining from her torso and thigh. But instead of laying in the dirt and giving up, she eventually picked up and started walking toward densely occupied parts of the base.Sgt. Collin Gillikin of Rockford, Mich., had slipped away for an early morning of fishing when he spotted Jessica limping along the road. She looked at first to Gillikin like a tired marathon runner, maybe a competitor in one of the many weekend races.“She was stumbling a little bit, which is why I slowed down,” he said. And then he realized the muddy stuff caked on her face and stomach was a mix of dirt and blood, and the reality of the situation set in. “I was in pure amazement that this woman was still talking and able to comprehend what I was saying.”Gillikin is a combat medic, and he helped her into the truck and drove her to an on-base hospital. She was then transferred to the Alaska Native Medical Center, where a week and a half after the May 18 attack she is still recovering."I think everybody was kind of under shock,” Gamboa said. "They had to clean me up like crazy before they could even touch me with any medical device."Base officials believe the attack on Gamboa was an isolated incident."It was a 'wrong time, wrong place' situation," Webb said.Editor's note: An initial version of this story inaccurately gave Jessica Gamboa's first name as Sarah and has been corrected.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

His next of kin have been notified.National Transportation Safety Board investigator Catherine Gagne says the wreckage of the privately owned 1947 Piper PA-12 has been removed from the crash site for further investigation.APD spokesperson Jennifer Castro said Anchorage police and fire departments were notified of the crash at 8:25 a.m.All runways at Merrill Field were shut down in response to the crash, Castro said, while the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration were notified.Gagne also confirmed Hancock was the only occupant of the plane and the reported fatality in the crash."It's our understanding that the aircraft was taking off from runway 25 (parallel to 5th Avenue)," Gagne said. "It was in contact with the tower at the time. We do have some witnesses who saw the flight; we're interested in talking to them."Glen Alsworth, the owner of Lake Clark Air, heard the plane and went outside to watch it as it began to take off."Like any good pilot, I wanted to watch -- you always do," Alsworth said. "As it lifted up at a very steep angle of climb, at about 100 feet, it looked like the angle was so great that the airplane couldn't sustain (its climb)."Alsworth watched as the plane's nose pitched over and it came back down toward the ground, he said."It looked like a near-vertical attitude," Alsworth said.Another witness, Alaska Aircraft Engines employee Tyler Seybert, says the wreck didn't appear survivable."I saw the pilot and he seemed like he was dead on impact, and it was very graphic," Seybert said. "It's definitely sad; it's the first time I've seen something like that, so I'm a little bit -- I don't know how to explain it."Don Reed says he formed a 30-year-long friendship with Hancock after the two men met while hot-air ballooning. Reed says he and Hancock -- whom Reed's three children knew as "Uncle Charlie" -- were co-owners of the plane that crashed."He loved the Alaska lifestyle," Reed said. "He was big into air sports, skydiving, hot-air ballooning, and he and I bought this airplane years and years ago. He was a very good pilot and he loved to fish too and to hunt -- we loved to hunt."While Hancock had far-ranging interests, Reed says he took a meticulous approach to his hobbies."He wasn't reckless, though -- he loved doing what he did," Reed said. "He was very scientific in his approach to things; he liked to know how things worked, both mechanically and physically. He was one of those guys that studied things and then went out and loved to build stuff and tinker with things and have fun."Employees of the state medical examiner's arrived at the scene to move Hancock's body, at which point NTSB crews began removing the wreckage from the runway. Gagne says Merrill Field reopened shortly after the runway was cleared.Preliminary documents have been taken from the scene, according to Gagne; the plane wasn't carrying cargo in its rear area, with only a few items there in a contained compartment. The next step in the investigation will include taking witness accounts and gathering information about Hancock.Gagne says an initial NTSB report on the crash will be released in about a week. In the meantime, Hancock's friends are struggling to accept his loss."He was just one of your truly nice guys, like the Billy Joel song, 'Only the Good Die Young,'" Reed said. "He was just one of those really good guys."Channel 2's Samantha Angaiak, Ariane Aramburo,Chris Klint,Adam Pinskerand Garrett Turnercontributed to this report.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But on Wednesday, as they walked, enjoying views of the Matanuska Glacier, they said the walk is becoming easier. Their finish line is less than 100 miles away."Even with the shin splints, the blisters and everything, it got easier and easier because of the support of the people," said Fred John.Fred, Harry, and Harry's wife Diane began this journey on foot on May 1 at Dot Lake, near the Canadian border. The starting point is significant -- it's the home of Doris Charles and Gene Henry, who were plaintiffs in the fight over subsistence rights that became known as the Katie John case.The walkers plan to arrive in Anchorage on May 31, to mark one year since their mother's death. A celebration is planned for 3 p.m. at the Alaska Native Medical Center.Their trek is called "Walk for Tsucde" which translates to "Walk for Grandma." They say that's how many people knew Katie John, but they want people to remember her legacy, one they fear is in danger. That is why they walk -- to bring attention to subsistence rights."We have lost a spiritual connection with the land and the people of it, and in a way I hope this walk revives our spiritual ways and the tradition that we have lost," said Harry John."We are concerned about our subsistence rights as Native people," said Fred John. "She fought for us, for the Native people of Alaska; and she did it with kindness and she did it with, you know, determination."Along the way, some people have stepped away from their lives and walked with them for a while. Diane and her friend Pamela run the support side of the planned walk -- taking food, water and other necessities to Fred and Harry, and making sure the men are doing OK.During the first two-thirds of the trip, the group pushed themselves, walking up to 20 miles a day. Now, they're walking about half that. And while it's a struggle, they say the cause is worth every step -- one their mother would be proud of."I know she's with us. She's walking with us right now," said Fred John. "I think she'd really approve of us."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Replace junk food with these staples and try some of my tips for choosing healthier options at the grocery store.Fill your fridge with the colors of the rainbow.You really can’t go wrong with any fresh fruits or vegetables, just make sure that you choose a variety of these nutrient-rich plant foods daily and make them a part of every meal and snack. Some of my top superfood picks include: spinach, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, kale, oranges, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and squash. While it’s fine to stock up on your favorites, consider trying a new food from the produce section every week. Not only will you improve your nutrient intake this way, but you’ll expand your taste buds too!Whole grains should get first dibs in your pantry to help maximize your weight loss efforts.Researchers have shown that women who eat more whole grains consistently weigh less than those who eat less of these fiber-rich foods. The great thing about whole grains is they can last a long time in your pantry, so stock up. Be sure you choose “whole” rather than refined grains, and avoid the processed versions, which typically have much of the nutrition stripped away–not to mention added salt, sugar, and preservatives. Think rolled oats, brown and wild rice, quinoa, ready-to-eat high-fiber cereals, and 100 percent whole grain breads and pasta.Make protein packed foods a kitchen staple.Fill your fridge and pantry with poultry, fish, shellfish (e.g., shrimp and scallops), eggs, non-fat milk and Greek yogurt, low-fat cheese, soymilk, tofu, beans and lentils (dried and/or canned), nuts/seeds, and nut butters. If you include protein-rich foods as a part of every meal and snack you will stay satisfied, eat less, and lose weight faster than if you skimped on the protein.It’s easy to sabotage your weight loss efforts if you aren’t careful with your fat intake.Fat is one of those tricky components of any weight loss endeavor because it contains more calories per gram than protein and carbs. In other words, a little fat goes a long way. First off, don’t buy the fat-laden sweets and snacks like pastries, chips, processed meats (e.g., bacon, sausage, and hot dogs), butter and full-fat dairy (e.g., whole milk, ice cream). If they aren’t in your house, you are less likely to eat them. Instead choose healthy fats from foods like salmon and tuna (fresh and canned in water), nuts/seeds, nut butters, avocado, and olive oil. Importantly, eating fewer saturated fats and choosing more unsaturated and essential fats can shift your body’s fat-burning mechanisms into high gear.Beverages can make or break your weight loss efforts.If you’re drinking sodas, Frappuccinos, lattes, and sweetened juice or energy drinks everyday, you could easily add more than 20 pounds to your body weight every year–from these liquids alone. Even if you’re exercising on a regular basis, consuming these high-calorie beverages means you’ll have to work extra hard to burn off these empty calories. Stick primarily to water, but mix it up with green tea and coffee (sweetened with a natural, no-calorie sweetener such as stevia if desired), non-fat milk or soymilk. For a special treat, try seltzer water with a splash of 100 percent fruit juice and a lemon, lime, or orange slice for extra zing.Wondering if you should forever avoid the snack aisle? Of course not!While processed snack foods can easily increase your daily calorie intake, if you are careful with portion sizes and make wise choices, then indulging in a healthy treat makes sense. Think 100 percent fruit sorbet, popcorn, trail mix, dried fruit (e.g., raisins, figs, dates), dark chocolate, non-fat frozen yogurt, and high-fiber muffins. Be sure to pair your snack with some produce and/or protein for staying power. For example, an apple and high fiber muffin.Don’t forget about freezer basics.Frozen fruits and vegetables provide a nourishing alternative to fresh produce and can help you prepare a healthy meal or snack when you’re in a pinch. Edamame (soybeans in the pod), peas, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, corn, and veggie stir-fry combos go from the freezer to plate in no time. Berries, pineapple, mango, and peaches are delicious to eat frozen right out of the bag or can be added to your favorite smoothie recipe.Having the right condiments and seasonings on hand can help you prepare tasty and healthy mealswithout added fat and sodium.Be sure to stock your pantry with low-sodium chicken and vegetable broth, claim juice, canned tomatoes and tomato paste, marinara sauce (no sugar added), light coconut milk (for soups and curries), low-sodium soy sauce, dijon mustard dry white wine, balsamic vinegar, fresh garlic and ginger, and a variety of dried herbs and spices (e.g., Italian blend, curry powder, chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, no-salt/no-MSG mixed herb seasoning).Source: Pure MattersCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

Sean Parnell has named a former Alaska Wildlife Troopers head the state’s new Department of Public Safety commissioner, succeeding Joe Masters.In a Thursday statement, Parnell’s office announced that retired Col. Gary Folger, 55, an Athabascan born in Anchorage, will be the next DPS commissioner. Masters retired from the post in mid-October.“Colonel Folger is a dedicated, respectful leader with a broad persepctive of the Department of Public Safety operations,” Parnell said in the statement. “He has the professionalism and skill to lead the department forward as they work to serve and protect Alaskans.”Folger joined troopers’ ranks in Fairbanks in 1981, then transferred to King Salmon in 1991. He was promoted to corporal in 1995 and sergeant in 1997, before reaching lieutenant in 1998 and transferring to Juneau and then Fairbanks to oversee local detachments with the Division of Fish and Wildlife Protection. In 2007 he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of wildlife troopers, eventually retiring from the department in May.Parnell thanked AST Director Col. Keith Mallard, whohad stepped into the commissioner's post on an acting basis,for his service.Sharon Leighow, a spokesperson for Governor Parnell, said Folger will decide on Mallard’s next position. His former position as AST director is currently being filled on an acting basis by Col. James Cockrell.Correction: a previous version of this story reported that Mallard would return to his position as AST director. The story has been edited to show that the Folger has not yet made that decision.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The State of Alaska is siding with the feds to keep state control.<COL>Fisheries ManagementA group of fish processors, permit holders and crew members are suing the federal government over a measure giving the Department of Commerce broad authority to manage and conserve coastal fisheries.The 312-member United Cook Inlet Drift Association says the state's salmon management plan is inadequate. The group is suing to make the federal government the lead regulator in state waters.The Feds say they're not cut out for that job and the state of Alaska agrees, and is backing the federal government in this case.The National Marine Fisheries Service is the defendant both groups want to take over managing all five species of salmon in the Cook Inlet region.  Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the state can regulate the salmon fisheries up to three miles off shore."One of the things that would be so cumbersome about having two management systems is that user groups would have to go through two regulatory processes for everything they do, the state regulatory process and the federal regulatory process,” said Fish & Game Commissioner Cora Campbell.Federal regulators admitted they wouldn't be able to respond to change in abundance or have the ability to enact emergency closures.Channel 2 reached out to the UCIDA and the attorneys representing the organization, but have yet to hear back.  Director Roland Maw declined an invitation to testify before a joint House-Senate Subcommittee Tuesday.“UCIDA supports the conservation and management measures necessary to prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the maximum (optimum) yield from each fishery for the United States Fishing Industry,” Maw said in a letter addressed to the committee."There are threatened species listings of Beluga in the inlet, it's uncertain how that is going to impact salmon management in the state, there are budget shortfalls happening just within the National Marine Fisheries Service," said Ricky Gease, Director of the Kenai Sport Fishing Association.Commissioner Campbell says the pending lawsuit has no effect on current management practices in Cook Inlet.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Troopers were first informed of the incident at about 12:45 a.m. Tuesday, with a trooper from King Salmon delayed by poor weather and responding later that day.“There was a Russian New Year’s celebration that night in the village,” Ipsen wrote. “People reported that Andrew showed up at this celebration intoxicated (alcohol) and was driving around the village recklessly. The kids were headed home from this celebration.”According to Ipsen, the 9-year-old was riding a 120cc Sno-Go, which was towing a sled carrying the 6-year-old. The collision occurred at a main intersection in Levelock, near the local Russian Orthodox Church.“The 9-year-old spotted the Andrew’s ATV lights up ahead and stopped to let it go through the intersection,” Ipsen wrote. “Instead, the Honda 500 ATV Andrew was driving came around the corner, hit the snowmachine and ran over the sled.

Up to 5,350 acres of wetlands, ponds and lakes also would be lost.In a Wednesday statement responding to the EPA report, Sen. Mark Begich says he will spend the next few days reviewing its findings.“I have always said I will let science be my guide, and my decision whether to support the Pebble project will be based on this report,” Begich said. “The stakes are high for Alaska -- I have heard from thousands of Alaskans on this issue -- and that is why I will be thoroughly reviewing the final watershed assessment and continuing to rely on science for any final decision.”A statement from Jason Metrokin, the president and CEO of Pebble Mine opponent Bristol Bay Native Corp., hailed Alaska Natives' role in calling for the EPA's review, while calling for the agency to take action against the proposed project.“From the very beginning, EPA was in Bristol Bay because our federally recognized tribes and Native organizations, including BBNC, asked them to be," Metrokin said. "With today’s release, science has weighed-in: Bristol Bay, its existing jobs and way of life could be irreparably damaged by a large-scale mine that is the size and scope of the Pebble project -- and therefore, our fish, our people and our cultures must be protected."The EPA has said its goal was to get the science right but The Pebble Partnership's CEO John Shively says he thinks the assessment wasn't scientific at all."I think from the beginning it's been a political based document," Shively said. "They really haven't done the kind of work that we and the state of Alaska and others have asked them to do."Shively thinks the EPA didn't find the true affects mining would have on salmon, instead it replace it with affects mining would have on streams. Opponents of the pebble mine, like Trout Unlimited Consultant Rick Halford, say the EPA's assessment falls short on estimating the potential impact."If anything they probably under estimate the potential threat because the biggest proposal they talk about is just a little more than half the size of the deposit," Halford said. "The EPA is based on their lower projections and the lowest one probably doesn't even reflect the cost of building the infrastructure."The EPA says its next step will be a regulatory action but no time table has been set for that decision.Channel 2's Chris Klint and Garrett Turner contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014,  KTUU-TV and Associated PressNo email address was supplied by.

Lisa Murkowski playing a part in the decision.<COL>CREATIVE COMMONS / whologwhyThe U.S. Department of Agriculture will purchase $20 million in canned Alaska pink salmon for nationwide distribution to hungry Americans, with a suggestion from Sen. Lisa Murkowski playing a part in the decision.According to a Friday statement from Murkowski’s office, the purchase follows $126 million in produce acquired last week by USDA’s The Emergency Food Action Program. The Alaska Republican was the lead GOP signer of a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack from a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators recommending that purchase, in light of food banks’ increased need across the country.“Every Alaskan knows that our salmon is brain food and full of protein, so I suggested the Department of Agriculture consider our nutritious and delicious salmon for food banks nationwide experiencing high levels of need,” Murkowski said in the statement.Murkowski spokesperson Matthew Felling says the money for the salmon is drawn from existing USDA funds. He says the senator’s pitch for the program to buy fish was a natural offshoot of the produce purchase.“We had them on the phone last week and we’re like, ‘We have a big surplus of pink salmon up here in Alaska,’” Felling said.Felling estimates that the money will buy about 5,000 tons of salmon. It wasn’t immediately clear Friday afternoon whether the fish would simply be certified as caught in Alaska or purchased from Alaska sources.Sen. Mark Begich’s office hailed the purchase in a Friday statement, saying the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute “spearheaded” the USDA pitch. The funds represent a sharp increase from the department’s usual annual purchases of $5 million to $10 million in salmon.“Begich said he hopes this year’s increased purchases will help ease overstocked supplies following last year’s record catch,” officials wrote. “The purchase will also benefit fishermen by reducing inventories that have weighed salmon prices down on the market.”According to Felling, once the USDA purchases the fish individual states will make arguments for their need of the program’s resources. He says the fish may be distributed in about four to six weeks.“Food banks are looking for help, and the Department of Agriculture has a program that’s in place for this exact purpose,” Felling said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"The more oil and gas we burn, the more CO2 we emit into the atmosphere, and that is the only driving force behind ocean acidification."Mathis said NOAA is studying pH levels with buoys anchored in different bodies of water, and by taking research vessels out to areas they're interested in studying.Some effects are being seen to the terapods that pink salmon feed on, but it's not entirely known how acidification will affect the pink salmon population. Researchers are trying to determine how, or if, the pink salmon can survive without the terapods.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Everybody is coming together in this moment of crisis -- from filling up pickup trucks’ water tanks to helping out firefighters and hotshot crews, the town of Tyonek is helping out.Born in Tyonek and raised on fishing, all John Standifer knows is his tiny village. He's lived here all his life, growing close to all of his fellow villagers.“Just about the whole village is my family, one way or the other,” Standifer said.Standifer says he sees panic in their eyes.“I'm worried about the whole town, the fuel tanks -- just worried,” Standifer said.Many families have sought refuge, taking in those forced out of their homes.“Nobody grabbed pots, nobody grabbed nothing to eat,” Standifer said. “We just grabbed whatever we could think of and got out of there.”For residents, fish camps near Tyonek have suddenly become personal refuges.“Right now, most of my family is here right now,” Standifer said. “We all have fish camps, like three or more down that way, that's all filled up.”Village voices echo what a lot of people in Tyonek are thinking: how big is this fire, and will it destroy the town?The Alaska Division of Forestry says the fire has burned more than 1,000 acres, with hotshot crews and firefighters working around the clock to contain it by building a fire break on its southern edge. Forestry officials say the fire is at zero percent containment Tuesday, forcing many to flee.On Tuesday afternoon, Tyonek’s tribal council announced the evacuation as soon as possible of all elders, as well as anyone who has lung or respiratory problems.“Everyone's been accounted for,” said Donita Slawson, the Native Village of Tyonek’s tribal administrator. “We're kind of keeping our eye on making sure we know where everyone is, because that's part of the training too, is to make sure we know where everyone is at all times.”While the fire rages, concerns have turned to food and supplies. The Tyonek Native Corp. is flying in necessities at least once a day, but resident Janelle Verduce fears that the village’s fate hinges on the weather.“Who's to know what the fire is going to do with the wind?” Verduce said. “It still is a panic attack.”Looking up at the smoke, Verduce knows the fire is near, but can't see how close it is.“We've lived her for a very long time, and we didn't want to lose our homes ‘cause that's all we have,” Verduce said.As Verduce’s hope is tested, she looks to those around her for peace.“We have each other and our strength is living within each other,” Verduce said.Tyonek Native Corp. is taking donations for the village at any Wells Fargo Bank branch through the Tebughna Foundation’s account, 7758543065. In Anchorage, donated goods can also be dropped off at TNC’s headquarters at 1689 C St., Suite 219.For more information on how to donate, Debra Call at TNC can be reached by phone at 907-272-0707.Editor's note: An incorrect spelling of John Standifer's last name has been corrected.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The debate...<COL>King Cove Land Swap DeniedIt's the sights and sounds that make the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge one of the most unique wilderness areas in the world.Besides salmon, wolf, fox, caribou, and brown bear, migratory birds like water fowl and Pacific black brant take a break here during their summer migrations.It's a staging area that wilderness advocates say makes the difference between life and death."Virtually the entire world population of Pacific black brant stop to feed and gather fat stores at Izembek. They feed on some of the largest eel grass beds in the world," said Tim Woody of The Wilderness Society.It's one reason why the environmental group applauded the Department of the Interior's decision Monday to not allow a road to pass through the refuge, despite years of lobbying for the road by residents of nearby King Cove."It isn't just that the species themselves are important, but it's the importance of the refuge to those species," said Woody.But King Cove residents said the federal government is inconsistent."You've got skiffs over there riding through the eel grass beds that they're talking about, that are so special to the birds," said King Cove Mayor Henry Mack.The government determined that Izembek is vital to a rich diversity of species, and that more long-term solutions are needed. Solutions that don't involve a road cutting through the refuge.Mack said there is already activity in the protected land."They already have 40 some odd miles of road and trails that two or three thousand hunters come in on every year, guided hunts for bird hunting," he argued.Woody said the Wilderness Society understands the frustration of King Cove residents, but insists they're focused on long term protection for all."The argument that we are putting birds in front of people is just false," he said.  "We are sympathetic to King Cove's needs for improved transportation and medical evacuation capacity. We just feel the road is not the best solution for that."Mack said he, and others in King Cove, disagree. "I've had to medevac two of my young grandchildren out in the last two years," he said. He argued that a road could help with those kind of emergencies.It's an ongoing debate over a road that, for right now, is going nowhere.The Department of the Interior press secretary Jessica Kersaw wrote in a statement that "the birds are federally protected because they inhabit or stop over in a National Wildlife Refuge and wilderness, which constitutes federally protected lands and waters."Unless otherwise specified, no motorized equipment or mechanical transport (with the exception of wheelchairs) is allowed on the refuge.A restriction that Kersaw said is generally true for all federal lands managed as designated wilderness.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The Mediterranean diet incorporates the basics of healthy eating — plus a splash of flavorful olive oil and perhaps even a glass of red wine — among other components characterizing the traditional cooking style of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.Most healthy diets include fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains, and limit unhealthy fats. While these parts of a healthy diet remain tried-and-true, subtle variations or differences in proportions of certain foods may make a difference in your risk of heart disease.Research has shown that the traditional Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease. In fact, an analysis of more than 1.5 million healthy adults demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of death from heart disease and cancer, as well as a reduced incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends the Mediterranean diet as an eating plan that can help promote health and prevent disease. And the Mediterranean diet is one your whole family can follow for good health.The Mediterranean diet emphasizes:The diet also recognizes the importance of being physically active, and enjoying meals with family and friends.The Mediterranean diet traditionally includes fruits, vegetables and grains. For example, residents of Greece average six or more servings a day of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables.Grains in the Mediterranean region are typically whole grain and usually contain very few unhealthy trans fats, and bread is an important part of the diet. However, throughout the Mediterranean region, bread is eaten plain or dipped in olive oil — not eaten with butter or margarine, which contains saturated or trans fats.Nuts are another part of a healthy Mediterranean diet. Nuts are high in fat, but most of the fat is healthy. Because nuts are high in calories, they should not be eaten in large amounts — generally no more than a handful a day. For the best nutrition, avoid candied or honey-roasted and heavily salted nuts.The focus of the Mediterranean diet isn't on limiting total fat consumption, but rather on choosing healthier types of fat. The Mediterranean diet discourages saturated fats and hydrogenated oils (trans fats), both of which contribute to heart disease.The Mediterranean diet features olive oil as the primary source of fat. Olive oil is mainly monounsaturated fat — a type of fat that can help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when used in place of saturated or trans fats. "Extra-virgin" and "virgin" olive oils (the least processed forms) also contain the highest levels of protective plant compounds that provide antioxidant effects.Canola oil and some nuts contain the beneficial linolenic acid (a type of omega-3 fatty acid) in addition to healthy unsaturated fat. Omega-3 fatty acids lower triglycerides, decrease blood clotting, and are associated with decreased incidence of sudden heart attacks, improve the health of your blood vessels, and help moderate blood pressure. Fatty fish — such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon — are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Fish is eaten on a regular basis in the Mediterranean diet.The health effects of alcohol have been debated for many years, and some doctors are reluctant to encourage alcohol consumption because of the health consequences of excessive drinking. However, alcohol — in moderation — has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in some research studies.The Mediterranean diet typically includes a moderate amount of wine, usually red wine. This means no more than 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine daily for women of all ages and men older than age 65 and no more than 10 ounces (296 milliliters) of wine daily for younger men. More than this may increase the risk of health problems, including increased risk of certain types of cancer.If you're unable to limit your alcohol intake to the amounts defined above, if you have a personal or family history of alcohol abuse, or if you have heart or liver disease, refrain from drinking wine or any other alcohol.The Mediterranean diet is a delicious and healthy way to eat. Many people who switch to this style of eating say they'll never eat any other way. Here are some specific steps to get you started:No email address was supplied by.

Giving up dairy products doesn't mean you can't get enough calcium. Calcium is found in many other foods, such as:If you forgo all dairy products, it's also important to make sure you get enough vitamin D. There aren't too many foods with significant amounts of vitamin D, but eggs, liver and yogurt contain vitamin D. Your body also makes vitamin D when exposed to the sun. But, this doesn't happen when you're wearing sunscreen, which is necessary for protecting your skin from skin cancer.Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can help you plan your meals.

Sean ParnellWalmart leaders visit a Juneau laboratory as part of a visit to discuss sustainability issues with Alaska political leaders.Walmart decided this summer that Alaska salmon fisheries may not be up to par ecologically, prompting state leaders to embark on a lobbying effort to make sure the state’s famous fish stay on the shelves of the world’s largest retailer.A few months ago, a group of state leaders trekked all the way to Bentonville, Ark., where Walmart is headquartered, to make a sales pitch that continued Wednesday in Juneau.Controversy stems from Walmart’s insistence that fisheries providing the company salmon hold a sustainability certification issued by London-based Marine Stewardship Council.The Alaska Congressional Delegation, fishing industry leaders and an array of state-level government officials argue the certification is unnecessary for Alaska.“Alaska is the pioneer of sustainability,” Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, told KTUU. “We understand it, we built our fisheries around it, our Constitution dictates it.”But the state still has no independent, third-party certification proving that the state’s fisheries are sustainable, a distinction that is used as a marketing tool.The state Department of Fish and Game sponsored the certification twice but declined to do so again in the fall of 2011, in part because of the program’s cost.The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute developed an alternate sustainability certification it hopes will be approved by Wal-Mart.Gov. Sean Parnell met Wednesday with Walmart executives at the Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute to try and get closer to a resolution.There was no immediate resolution, but Commerce Commissioner Susan K. Bell said there was progress by showing firsthand the commitment to maintaining world-class fisheries.“Alaska seafood is very important to them, so is sustainability,” Bell said. “They need a third-party that they can point to so they’re consistent with all the products that they source.”Part of the problem from Walmart's perspective was a perceived lack of transparency – the certification program developed by ASMI is not published online – seems to be fixable, Bell said.Walmart said in a release described the meetings as “very productive.”“Walmart remains committed to buying Alaska seafood,” the company said in a release. “By working together…we’ll continue to source quality seafood from Alaska for years to come.”No immediate timeline for a resolution came out of the meeting.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Before you haul your next can to the curb, take a moment to survey what you’re throwing out. Much of the stuff that we regularly discard -- from beer cans to banana peels -- is actually worth real money. Sure, maybe it’s not exactly King Tut’s tomb, but if you know what you’re looking for, you could add a little walking around money to your pockets. Here are some of the most valuable things people throw out on a regular basis.Bottles and Cans:A handful of statesoffer a cash reward for your green behavior, or, more accurately, punish you for your wastefulness. Every time you buy a case of beer of a six of soda, you’re coughing up 5 to 10 cents a container. You can get that money back if you take the time to take your bottles and cans back to a recycling center. But judging from the legions of shopping cart-pushing Dumpster divers fishing containers from the trash in my San Francisco neighborhood, many people don’t. Even with the shrewd scavengers cleaning up after us, the California government estimates that 3.5 billion of these containers end up in landfills each year.In addition toCalifornians, residents of Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,Michigan, New York, Oregon and Vermont can also cash in their cans and bottles. You might not think that these nickels and dimes add up to much, but you could earn $182.50 per year by redeeming one bottle per day.Scrap Metal:Nickels and dimes from bottles and cans are fine, but if you want to land a really big score, there’s only one place to turn: scrap metal. Scrap metal prices have been on the rise in recent years.Copper, for instance, will fetch you around $3.65 a pound. While scrap metal isn't one of the most plentiful items in the trash, you probably have a lot more sitting around than you think -- for instance, left over metal posts from a fencing job, a old cast iron sink slowly rusting in the garage, or broken-down appliances that have finally kicked the bucket. Rather than just chuck this stuff, or even worse, pay someone to haul it away, do your research and figure out if you’re sitting on a goldmine. Or at least a copper mine.Compost:At $5 for a large bag, potting soil isn’t exactly expensive. But if you’re looking to fill an entire garden with the stuff, it isn’t exactly cheap, either. Fortunately, composting has never been so easy! An open bin, a little sunshine and some water, and you’ll be producing rich compost in no time. You’ll be surprised at how many pounds ofcompostable materialyou’ve been wasting all these years. And not only will you be saving money on soil, but think about how much you’ll be saving at the grocery store with all the vegetables you’ll be able to grow.Cooking Oil:With the price of gas sky high, biodiesel -- an environmentally friendly alternative -- has been commanding record prices. Made from refining used cooking oil, biodiesel is an ingenious method of turning something that was once a waste product into a useful source of energy. However, prices for the stuff have risen so much in recent years thatthieves are now casing fast food restaurants to plot sly grease heistswhere they surreptitiously drain the vats of fat behind burger joints. So if you’re a deep-frying fiend, don’t let the thieves steal your grease. At 40 cents a pounds, you should cash it in. Not only will it put money in your pocket, but you’ll be helping out the environment.Found Art:If you live in a fashionable zip code, you can pawn your garbage off on foolish art lovers. At least that’s one New York artist has done. Clad in a sleek transparent cube, these pieces of repurposed refuse fetch as much as $100. Of course this isn’t any old trash. This garbage iscurated.Artist Justin Gignac has selected only the best of New York City’s trash, including crushed coffee cups, spent MetroCards, and the detritus from a Yankees parade. Sure, it’s a silly way to drop $100; but don’t you wish you’d thought of it first?Source:http://www.networx.com/article/cash-in-your-trashDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But the Russian Old Believers of Nikolaevsk know that preserving tradition requires a lot of work.<COL>In a community tucked away outside of Anchor Point, the warm spring weather reminds dozens of people living here of all the work that the upcoming summer holds. But the Russian Old Believers of Nikolaevsk know that preserving tradition requires a lot of work.As a fisherman, Artem Kuzmin is busy preparing for the summer fishing season. He expects to spend about four days hanging line in his driveway. Nearby, under the freshly-tilled soil, are radishes and potatoes.Kuzmin says while it's early, he's hopeful they will sprout soon. He will likely get about a thousand pounds of potatoes from that patch, he says. Along with potatoes and radishes, Kuzmin grows green onion, rhubarb, raspberries and strawberries. In Nikolaevsk, he says, living off the land in the summertime is easy."You can, pretty much -- everything grows, and you can store it underneath the house," Kuzmin said.Living as a farmer and fisherman takes a little faith -- something the Russian Old Believers who make up a majority of Nikolaevsk’s roughly 300 residents embrace. Four families settled Nikolaevsk in 1968, seeking a quiet life where they could practice their religion and preserve their culture.Dennis Fefelov's father, Kondraty Fefelov, came to Nikolaevsk in 1969. He was ordained in 1983 as the village's first priest -- but that led to a divide in the community."Once we accepted priesthood the community started splitting," Dennis Fefelov said. "Some people accepted priesthood and some people didn't."The Russian Orthodox Church saw a similar rift in the 1600s, when the Old Believers left the faith to protest church reform. Old Believers settled down in communities all over the world before coming to the United States; Nikolaevsk’s founders moved to Alaska from Oregon. Until they came to Alaska, they did not know how to fish or build boats, says fisherman Nikolai Yakunin."We needed to find work and jobs were not really available, so we got into fishing," said Yakunin, who is also the village priest -- making him both a fisherman and a fisher of men.For the Old Believers, life revolves around religion. The Church of St. Nicholas is seen as the center of the community. Old Believers gather at the sacred place on Sundays, each of their several holidays, and for communions, baptisms, marriages and other religious events.The church is ornate, decorated with painted icons on the inside and outside. A bright blue and white cupola tops the bell tower, where church bells ring before each service. In church, men stand in the front, women are in the back. Non-believers can observe and learn the religion from the church entryway.Keeping with tradition, services are performed in Old Slavonic, but it's a language that few people understand. Father Nikolai says this is the church's biggest challenge."We've been discussing the issue. Maybe we should slowly start changing it into English because everybody speaks English a lot better than Russian," Yakunin said. "Of course, some community people don't want it to be changed."For the church, other changes are in the works. Two years ago, the community decided to build a bigger parish. It sits directly behind the current church and is still under construction. The Old Believers of Nikolaevsk want a church that will attract people seeking God, says Father Nikolai."You go into a community and the first thing people want to show you is their church. That's their pride," he said.The project still has a long way to go and the community is seeking more funding and donations. They are planning a big consecration, inviting all who have helped out, once the church is complete.Many residents of Nikolaevsk say the village is becoming more modernized and less private than it used to be. Some people continue to wear traditional Russian clothes, made by women in the village.At the school, the student population of non-Old Believers is growing, says principal Michael Sellers. Currently, nearly 60 percent of students are from an Old Believer family. Today, more students are pursuing education beyond high school."In the past, eighth grade was a common finishing point for boys and girls," said Sellers. "The boys were going off and fishing, doing other things of that nature, the girls were getting married and starting their own families -- and so things have changed over the years."Vera Fefelov, an eighth grader at Nikolaevsk School and an Old Believer, says her two older brothers, who both attended Georgetown University, have inspired her to set the bar high. She says she wants to pursue a degree in medicine at Stanford."Where you're from doesn't really define where you're going," she said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

As the town coalesced, a blend of gold miners, Han Athabaskan natives, soldiers and those just seeking a place to call their own, over time, Eagle eventually became a cohesive unit.It was gold that brought miners from the Yukon Territory across the river to Alaskan territory. By the fall of 1898, early accounts estimated as many as 1,700 people had constructed cabins and tents along the Yukon River. It wasn’t long after that Eagle was determined to be a strategic location for the transportation, trade and communications center of the Yukon and interior Alaska.Like many mining towns at the time, Eagle boomed with commerce at the turn of the 20thcentury. Serving Yukon River towns from Saint Michael to Whitehorse, steam-wheelers more often associated with the Mississippi River operated an international trade route between the United States and Canada. The waterfront became the heart of Eagle’s economy as more and more buildings and warehouses were constructed.It wasn’t a luxurious lifestyle. After all, this was a mining town in Alaska. However, like many bustling townships, Eagle did have its fair share of amenities, including a church, a saloon and even a brothel. As one may expect, the combination of businesses attracted its share of lawlessness, so by 1899 Congress authorized a military reservation be constructed in Eagle, and it was that Fort Egbert – named for infantry Col. Harry C. Egbert – was established.As time passed, much of the mining activity in Eagle began shifting further west toward Nome and Fairbanks. By 1911, Fort Egbert was all but abandoned and Eagle began to settle into the city it would remain as today.The lawlessness of the late 19th/early 20thcentury Eagle had settled, but the rough and rugged nature of the city’s early settlers remained. “The misfits that live at the end of the road” became a welcome moniker for the residents of Eagle and it remains that way to this day.These days those who live in Eagle and/or those who choose to move there come for the challenge. Don’t come to Eagle looking for the height of fashion, unless it means wearing whatever is suited best for the day’s activity. And activities there are aplenty in Eagle for those interested in wide-open spaces, camping, fishing, mining and hiking.Eagle Bluff, for which the town earned its name, may not be home to as many eagles as it once was (peregrine falcons took over roost years ago), but it still provides a rigorous workout and some of the best vistas the city can afford.However, it’s the town’s history that is truly on display in Eagle. Residents work hard to preserve it. Homes as old as the city itself remain much the way they were when they were originally built and just as functional. Pat Sanders, president of Eagle’s Historical Society, believes that has a lot to do with the fact that the city looks after its own just as much as it looks after the town’s history.Despite its eclectic, no nonsense, history, Sanders calls the town a “wonderful, compact, dysfunctional family.”People wave at each other as they pass by, and they’ll do it again 30 minutes later when they see each other again. And then again 30 minutes after that, and so on. If they don’t wave back, they know there’s a problem, but “they’ll be there to help you the next day,” Sanders said.That’s the way they like it in Eagle, Sanders said. It may not be the most luxurious lifestyle, but if it's luxury they wanted, residents wouldn’t have moved to Eagle.Just like the Han tribes name translates, the residents of Eagle are the people by the river, the misfits at the end of the road. And that’s just the way they like it.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Dear Rural Alaska Caucus Member: I wanted to let you know that GCI pulled KTUU-TV from its rural cable systems and over 7,000...<COL>Below is a letter sent by KTUU-TV president and general manager Andy MacLeod to members of Alaska's rural caucus on November 9, 2013.Dear Rural Alaska Caucus Member:I wanted to let you know that GCI pulled KTUU-TV from its rural cable systems and over 7,000 subscribers1at midnight on November 8th. While the parties were only pennies apart on a multi-year deal, GCI demanded non-economic concessions that would have restrained our ability to operate as a media company and an independent news source for Alaska.The midnight deadline was of GCI’s choosing, and as late as 11:49 p.m. we repeated our offer of free carriage through 2014 for the rural areas. GCI rejected it as it has repeatedly done since tying rural carriage to negotiations for a longer term deal for Anchorage.GCI recently completed its purchase of three television stations – CBS affiliate KTVA in Anchorage and NBC affiliates KATH in Juneau and KSCT in Sitka – and the restraints it sought are clearly designed to give advantage to its TV stations at the expense of KTUU-TV.The GCI demands to which we would not agree include:1. GCI insists that KTUU allow it to carryanotherNBC signal on its rural systems (likely, its own NBC station from Juneau). KTUU has provided coverage to the rural areas since 1977 and on GCI since the mid-1990s. While GCI is free to negotiate with program providers, KTUU will not bow out of the way so GCI can feather its own nest and eliminate an independent source of Alaska news that has served rural residents for 35 years.2. GCI insists that KTUU grant it the right to place the station on a "tier". The FCC has required, for 20 years, that broadcasters be placed on the so-called "basic tier", traditionally the lowest cost option on a cable system. Despite KTUU’s offer to renegotiate “tier” positioning if the law eventually changes, GCI demanded KTUU-TV blindly consent to any such change now. This is an anti-consumer move on GCI's part as it would require rural Alaskans to pay more to receive KTUU-TV, the highest viewed channel on GCI's system.3. KTUU asked to be carried in High Definition (HD) to rural Alaska if, and only if, GCI carries another broadcaster in HD. GCI refused. Since GCI/Denali Media is advertising that it will carry its newly acquired CBS station in HD, this appears to be another attempt to use the pay cablesystem to disadvantage KTUU, GCI’s main televisioncompetitor. The subscribers paying GCI have made KTUU thetop rated channelon GCI's systems. It is anti-consumer to deny customers their favorite channel in HD to favor a station owned by GCI.4. We also sought the right to add a second signal onto our primary signal, which is called D2 in our industry. We offered GCI this additional programming for free, unless the station was another major network (Fox, ABC or CBS). Of course, GCI would have the right to reject such compensation if it chose not to carry the D2 signal. As such, it was a balanced offer – we could seek compensation, and GCI could refuse. GCI demanded any D2 be locked in at zero compensation.GCI’s demands, in addition to being anti-consumer and anti-competitive, appear to be unparalleled. We cannot find an example anywhere where a station has been pulled when the cable operator had the right to carry that station foranother year.GCI is suggesting that KTUU-TV is demanding “unreasonable” payments for its programming. At GCI's request, KTUU has been attempting to negotiate a long-term arrangement in which it would be fairly paid for the content it produces starting in 2015. (For nearly 20 years, GCI has been collecting fees from customers for this content, but paying local broadcasters nothing). By GCI's own admission, our fee request for 2015 islessthan the average NBC affiliate is being paidin 2013. Our request is less than 5-cents a day, 1/5 the rate GCI pays for many channels with much smaller viewership.GCI chastised KTUU-TV for stating the dispute between the cable operator and KTUU-TV “… is about choice in news…” and argued instead it is about money2. That is patently not true.Although the parties were pennies apart on economics, in its last offer to KTUU, GCI did not even address rates. Instead, GCI insisted KTUU accept the carriage terms we described above. These are thin veils on GCI's strategy to increase its monopoly position in rural distribution by favoring television content it now owns. By attempting to squeeze out competition and limit consumer choice in news and information, GCI is engaging in precisely the activities it promised it would not undertake when seeking FCC approval of its television purchases.KTUU’s main objective has been to avoid putting Alaskans in the middle of a complex business dispute and at 11:49pm on November 8th, we reiterated our offer to allow carriage at no charge through 2014. GCI refused and darkened the signal.We wanted you to know why KTUU-TV, the station more Alaskans watch than any other on GCI or over the air, is being blacked out in rural Alaska on cable, an area with some of the most limited choices in video and news in this country and where such information is often a matter of health and safety.Regards,Andrew MacLeodKTUU-TV President and General Manager1Affected communities are: Barrow, Bethel, Cordova, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Nome, North Slope oil fields, Valdez, Adak, Akutan, Anaktuvuk Pass, Whittier, Galena, Unalaska, King Salmon, Kaktovik, McGrath, Nikolski, those served by the Chugach McKinley system, Skagway, and Tanana.2 Nov. 1 letter to state legislators, Greg Chapados, Executive Vice President and COO GCI.No email address was supplied by.

The valley has seen enormous growth this past decade and Executive Director of Earth Economics David Batker says the watershed must be kept in mind as more land is developed, “We’ve got to have the right perspective of natural systems, you can kind of work with nature or you can work against it and mother nature is pretty tough to work against,” said Batker in front of a large crowd in Palmer.Along the Matanuska River human development is easy to see, and it’s accelerating but so are flooding concerns with their own economic toll. “Maybe we don’t want to build in the flood plane, maybe we want to value those natural services and that cuts down the cost of everybody in the borough that does not have to pay for emergency services to deal with flooded homes,” said Andy Couch with the Mat-Su Fish and Wildlife Commission.The goal is to be smart about development as the valley grows, while recognizing the value of the fish that swim nearby. “There needs to be a realistic economic evaluation of the overall view. You need to determine what might be the best use for any particular parcel of land,” said Howard Delo with the Mat-Su Borough Fish and Wildlife Commission.The Salmon Symposium continues Thursday at the Palmer Community Center Depot with discussions on conserving and restoring salmon habitat. The event is free and open to the public.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

GCI has stated it because of “costs” the telecom/cable operator has in delivering the signal to rural cable systems. That argument belies the fact that CHARGES subscribers for that signal every month.Why is rural Alaska being tied now to carriage for the Anchorage area for 2015 and beyond?GCI has stated it wants a deal that covers both rural Alaska and the Anchorage area for 2015 and beyond. While the parties came within pennies of each other for a four-year agreement before GCI pulled the plug Nov. 8, after GCI demanded concessions that would have hobbled KTUU-TV’s ability to compete against the newly acquired broadcast stations that GCI has bought in Alaska, KTVA and KATH and KSCT in Anchorage, Juneau and Sitka respectively.Does GCI’s entry into the TV business have anything to do with this blackout?Of course it does. GCI does not want to compete with KTUU-TV and its Channel 2 News product on a level playing field. So it is using its monopoly position in cable and telecom in Alaska in an attempt to hobble KTUU-TV and win the viewers’ choice by default. Simply put, if KTUU-TV is not a choice because GCI pulled it from the lineup, then GCI owned KTVA CBS news and GCI’s newly acquired Juneau NBC affiliate will be the only choices rural Alaskan GCI subscribers will get in news, information and entertainment. Rural Alaska also is served by ARCS programming, which carries some Channel 2 News and NBC entertainment. Click here to see the ARCS schedulehttp://www.arcstv.org/What is carriage and how does it work?To serve viewers who use a pay TV provider, KTUU-TV licenses the rights to carry our signal to cable companies like GCI Cable. These kinds of agreements are common throughout the United States and normally are reached without any disruption of service.What communities are affected?Communities affected are: Barrow, Bethel, Cordova, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Nome, North Slope, Valdez, Adak, Akutan, Anaktuvuk Pass, Whittier, Galena, Unalaska, King Salmon, Kaktovik, McGrath, Nikolski, Chugach McKinley, Skagway, and Tanana.How does this affect Juneau and southeast Alaskans?KTUU-TV provides all its Channel 2 News casts to KATH and KSCT, the NBC affiliates in Juneau and Sitka on an agreement with the former local owners that dates back over a decade.  GCI has demonstrated no willingness to pursue a similar business relationship, as its actions taken against rural Alaskans prove. The deadline for southeast losing access to Channel 2  News is Friday, Nov. 22..Will Juneau and southeast still get NBC programming without Channel 2 News if GCI pulls the carriage?Yes. GCI owns both KATH and KSCT and has an NBC license for those stations.If I live in rural Alaska what are my alternatives?In rural Alaska, you can cancel GCI cable and seek alternative delivery that includes KTUU-TV’s full lineup of NBC and Channel 2 programming. Those alternatives include Dish Network and DirecTV satellite TV. Microcom in Anchorage sells and installs both services and can be reached at 1-877-696-3474 orwww.microcom.tvMuch of KTUU-TV’s newscasts and some of NBC’s entertainment and sports programming is carried on the composite Alaska Rural Communication System (ARCS) and that lineup can be found listed atwww.arcstv.orgFor Channel 2 News, you can also download the free Airwave app on iOS or Andriod devices. The app streams Channel 2 News newscasts and stores them for five days in the cloud for video on demand.If you stay with GCI, tell them to lower your bill for the content you have lost. KTUU-TV is typically the most-watched channel in most Alaska households. You should not be paying for a service you are not receiving.You can also contact the Alaska Congressional delegation and the FCC along with the Attorney General of the state of Alaska and your local lawmakers if you believe you are being treated unfairly and not given the same access and rights as urban Alaskans, especially in regards to receiving an independent news source.Those addresses are listed at the bottom of the next page:You can learn more about how consumers in the lower 48 are dealing with similar cable pricing issues by viewing this Wall Street Journal article on the matter: Customers Say to Cable Firms, “Let’s Make A Deal”http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203479104577124494272500550.htmlIf I live in Juneau and southeast, what are my options?Unless you receive ARCS there, there are none since GCI now controls NBC for southeast and can decide what news you receive.When is the deadline and will the Anchorage area be affected?Anchorage and south central Alaska are under an agreement through Sept. 30, 2014.How does all this affect my monthly cable bill, which is already too high? Will it go up even more if GCI reaches an agreement with KTUU-TV?Your cable will not go up in 2014 based on any agreement KTUU-TV reaches with GCI. What will happen after 2014 depends on a variety of factors, but it is GCI that has sole discretion to raise or lower your bill. Programming costs are going up in the Pay TV business as are the costs faced by content companies like KTUU-TV of obtaining and generating programming. KTUU-TV has offered to provide its program feed to GCI for free through the end of 2014, and then will be asking for only pennies a day for the most watched programming on GCI cable. By comparison, independent Nielsen data indicates that GCI already pays far more for less popular content.GCI says it spends over $1 million a year to put signals from broadcasters up on a satellite for delivery to rural Alaska and that it cannot afford to pay that delivery cost. Is that true?Let’s do some basic math to estimate an answer:I. GCI’s 2012 SEC filing states it earns revenue from the average monthly video subscriber of $77.98II. GCI has about 7,000 residential subscribers on its rural system and an additional 3,000 subscribers on North Slope oil fields. That is 10,000 subscribers in total. However, based solely on the 7,000 primary residential subscribers, we can conservatively estimate that GCI earns 6-7 million dollars serving these viewers.III. GCI also has other revenue from the uplink, which is part of video revenues that GCI reported to be $115 million in 2012. Its total revenues were reported to be $720 million that year. As you can see, GCI has a very profitable business in rural Alaska, and its satellite costs are a small expense against the revenues it generates there. (For comparison, the revenue from all the commercial broadcasters in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau combined would not add up to 10 percent of GCI’s total revenue).Math aside, the reality is that GCI will save nothing in 2014 by pulling KTUU-TV as it will have to replace KTUU-TV with another signal. Further, you can learn more about the costs GCI alleges it has athttp://www.ktuu.com/about/ktuutvs-last-offer-to-gci-before-rural-alaska-blackout/-/21044658/22992632/-/13cmptmz/-/index.htmlGCI has stated that KTUU-TV wants $2 million for its carriage rights. Is KTUU-TV being greedy by looking for such payment?By its offer to allow free carriage of its signal in rural Alaska through 2014, KTUU-TV has offered GCI a way to continue complex business negotiations for 2015 and beyond without impacting customers. The companies have not reached a final deal and it is premature, to say the least, to speculate about what those final terms may be. For its part, KTUU-TV remains willing to negotiate in good faith, but it expects GCI to join that effort as well.  GCI says that it has never paid to retransmit a local broadcast signal.  That makes it almost unique among US cable operators.  That is only because of GCI’s monopoly position in video, broadband and wireless in rural Alaska and the size of the family owned and small corporations that make up the bulk of Alaska broadcasting.Let's be clear: GCI has been charging customers for local broadcast stations for years and keeping 100% of that money. KTUU-TV spends millions of dollars each year to bring Alaskans more than 22-hours of local news per week. Additionally, KTUU-TV incurs costs to bring viewers public affairs, network and syndicated entertainment programming. KTUU-TV is simply asking for a fair price for the valuable content it creates, which is among the most-viewed on GCI's lineup.Why does this dispute just affect KTUU-TV?All local television stations negotiate independently and may be on different timetables.How do I get in contact with some one at GCI?In Anchorage, 907-265-5400 and 1-800-800-4800 Statewide.Who can help me get the programming I pay for and ensure that NBC and Channel 2 News continue to come into my home in rural Alaska:Senator Lisa Murkowski709 Hart Senate BuildingWashington D.C. 20510PH 202-224-6665www.murkowski.senate.govSenator Mark Begich111 Russell Senate Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510PH 877-501-6275www.begich.senate.govCongressman Don Young2314 Rayburn House OfficeWashington, DC 20515PH 202-225-5765www.donyoung.house.govWilliam LakeChief, FCC Media Bureau445 12th Street, SWWashington, D.C. 20554Attorney General Michael C.

The men were issued fines and placed on parole earlier this year.According to recent court filings, 13 of them say the court made the wrong decision. A district court judge ruled the state's management of fish supersedes fishing as a spiritual practice.James Davis, attorney with the Northern Justice Project, says the state must reduce bi-catch from pollock fishermen, instead of restricting subsistence fishing.“The first thing the fishermen say is stop these outside interests from wasting king salmon before you interfere with our use of king salmon,” said Davis.Laura Fox, Assistant Attorney General, says the state will file a response to the appeal in January.“Those restrictions have to be enforceable in order to work so the people who were caught violating were prosecuted and fined and the state's division on appeal is those convictions should be upheld,” said Fox.Last summer, the Department of Fish and Game declared an emergency order for the river, shutting down subsistence fishing.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

However, I haven't joined him in that boat since I was a kid.If your dad is an outdoorsman and you just don't get it, don't worry. You can still find a Father's Day gift he'll love; it will just take a little more work.CampingIf Dad likes to camp, he probably has the basics -- a tent, sleeping bags and pads, rain gear, probably even a cookstove of some variety.So what can you provide?You could opt for an updated sleeping bag; the high-end ones keep you warm in freezing weather and fit like a glove. Or, if camping has become less and less about "roughing it" and more about relaxing, a hammock might be a fun choice. They come in either fold-up or hang-from-trees varieties. Speaking of fold-ups, how are your Dad's lawn chairs? If they're starting to show their age, you could upgrade to some fancier ones -- complete with the cutout hole for his beer.How about a pocket knife? If he doesn't already have one, it would be a good addition to his camping gear; you never know when those things will come in handy.Other camping gift options: updated cookstove, lantern, flashlights, hiking boots, or compass. And for the time Dad spends thinking about camping, some nature-related books might go over well --  find one that details the plants and wildlife around his favorite stomping grounds or one with new campfire recipes.FishingFishing gear has come a long way beyond the simple pole, bobber and tacklebox. Take inventory of what Dad already has (ask Mom for help if you need it), make sure you know what kind of fish he's fishing for, and head to the sporting goods store to find a lure that's sure to help reel them in. If your dad is like mine, he can't have enough lures to try.If he doesn't already have one with which he's in love, a fishing vest would also be a good gift. Get one with all sorts of little pockets in which he can stick his most often-used fishing tools, extra weights, lures, etc. However, I suspect that most dads who already have vests they like won't give them up for something too fancy, so make sure you know going in that it's something your dad will use.If you're looking to spend some money, you could surprise Dad with a new rod and reel. However, there are dozens -- OK, hundreds -- of varieties, so get some help with that. Ideally, get advice from one of his fishing buddies or, at the very least, a sporting-goods store clerk. And if you're still unsure, a gift certificate can be wrapped up, too.HuntingNow, I know very little about hunting, but I do know this: The gear depends entirely on what you're planning to hunt. If your dad is a deer hunter, you might invest in some extra orange gear for him or some of those cool battery-heated socks. It gets chilly in those tree stands! Along the same lines, a thermos or thermal lunchbox might also come in handy.For just about every other kind of hunting: Get out the camo! Can Dad really have enough camouflage gear? I think not. And if he's like most dads, he's not going to update his hunting wardrobe unless prompted. That's where you come in. Find another vest -- same style as the fishing one, but in camo -- as well as water-resistant pants for all the hiking through the wet fields in search of prey. You might also spring for binoculars or new boots.As far as the gun goes, you might want to leave that for Dad. But feel free to find him a new case and extra ammo.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Never earning a college degree, he is a self-made man and his tenacity and big ideas have helped him find success through a number of his endeavors.For as many big ideas Karl has seen succeed, there have also been big failures. And when those ideas have failed, it’s only pushed him to try it again, and learn why it failed in the first place. The most notable example of this may have materialized back in 2004 when Forbes Magazine hailed him the owner of the “Dumbest Business Idea of the Year,” the Aurora Ice Hotel. Karl had paid a team of ice carvers to construct the hotel – made totally of ice – only to watch the very expensive building melt before his eyes the following summer. Karl will be the first to admit the idea may not have been fully formed, but it didn’t stop him from trying again. Forbes’ dubious title had only motivated Karl more.“Forbes can kiss me on the thing Jesus rode into Nazareth on,” he’ll tell just about anyone in ear shot. “I took a frozen asset and turned it into a liquid asset.”Karl went from owning the dubious moniker of owner of the dumbest idea of the year in 2004 to the 2010 University of Alaska Fairbanks Business Leader of the Year. Following the literal meltdown his hotel experienced, Karl began selling vials of the liquefied hotel along with postcards celebrating his dumb idea. He sold them at $4.95 a piece and he sold them by the thousands.As he opened the doors to the very much functioning (and frozen) Aurora Ice Hotel, complete with rooms, a bar and dance floor, it became clear Karl thrives on the naysayers. That negativity helps power him like the geothermal energy his resort is famous for creating.Karl talks big, because the success of his ideas backs it up. He’s an example of what can be accomplished through a little recipe that includes “H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K,” he said.Karl estimated more than 150,000 people came to swim in his hot springs in 2013, and about 20 percent of his clientele are repeat customers.Karl’s tenacity and inability to concede isn’t an act put on for media types, either.Kali Gavora, 24, is manages the resort’s dog kennel, another of Karl’s many business endeavors, and the resort’s horse stables. She came to know Karl when she was just five-years-old when she and her mother came to the resort. Her mother, Jena, has worked with Karl for 19 years and is considered his right-hand woman.“He doesn’t believe in the word ‘can’t,’’ Gavora said.From the little town outside of Fairbanks, Two Rivers, Gavora can’t imagine working for anyone other than Karl. Maybe that will change one day. Like Karl, Gavora has made a successful life for herself through her own hard work, and Karl doesn’t take that for granted. The mentality Karl presents to Gavora and the others who work at the resort is infectious.Karl’s resort is home to a number of attractions, like horseback riding, ATV riding, hiking, fishing and more. However, Karl is also responsible for piloting initiatives in geothermal energy through the hot springs. That energy has earned him recognition in Popular Mechanics Magazine as a model for clean energy. The magazine called Karl a visionary and an ingenious engineer for tapping into one of the most overlooked energy resources – not fossil fuels – to produce electricity, heat and now hydrogen.That energy has helped him cultivate a greenhouse full of various vegetables, flower and herbs, all of which are used at the resort’s kitchen.Just being in Karl’s presence is enough to remind one of his infectious personality and his will to make things happen. Any idea seems possible.“I hope if I only get through to one or two people, I’ve made it, but I think I get through to a lot,” Karl said. “If I can sway just a few of them to use their imaginations, really use their imaginations, then I’ve done my job, haven’t I?”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Ice fishermen on the Noatak River say it pushed water through their fishing hole and on top of the ice. Amy Mitchell, a health aide in training at the Noatak clinic, said the quake caused a commotion there.“We have a VHF (radio) here and people were going on that,” Mitchell said. “Our other health aide and our supervisor were telling people to go under tables and under the doorframe -- interesting and scary for me.”Despite rattling buildings, no damage or injuries have been reported. Alaska State Troopers say they’ve received no calls asking for help or reporting damage. No tsunamis are expected, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.According to West, there’s no evidence suggesting the quakes are a prelude to something bigger. Dozens of aftershocks continued through Friday, but West says the seismic activity should die down by next week.“Our alarms have been going crazy all morning with each one of these sort of updating into our system, but they’ll die off into the coming days,” West said.The Earthquake Information Center says the quake was felt as far away as Kotzebue, but just barely.KNOM RadioNo email address was supplied by.

Replace junk food with these staples and try some of my tips for choosing healthier options at the grocery store.Fill your fridge with the colors of the rainbow.You really can’t go wrong with any fresh fruits or vegetables, just make sure that you choose a variety of these nutrient-rich plant foods daily and make them a part of every meal and snack. Some of my top superfood picks include: spinach, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, kale, oranges, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and squash. While it’s fine to stock up on your favorites, consider trying a new food from the produce section every week. Not only will you improve your nutrient intake this way, but you’ll expand your taste buds too!Whole grains should get first dibs in your pantry to help maximize your weight loss efforts.Researchers have shown that women who eat more whole grains consistently weigh less than those who eat less of these fiber-rich foods. The great thing about whole grains is they can last a long time in your pantry, so stock up. Be sure you choose “whole” rather than refined grains, and avoid the processed versions, which typically have much of the nutrition stripped away–not to mention added salt, sugar, and preservatives. Think rolled oats, brown and wild rice, quinoa, ready-to-eat high-fiber cereals, and 100 percent whole grain breads and pasta.Make protein packed foods a kitchen staple.Fill your fridge and pantry with poultry, fish, shellfish (e.g., shrimp and scallops), eggs, non-fat milk and Greek yogurt, low-fat cheese, soymilk, tofu, beans and lentils (dried and/or canned), nuts/seeds, and nut butters. If you include protein-rich foods as a part of every meal and snack you will stay satisfied, eat less, and lose weight faster than if you skimped on the protein.It’s easy to sabotage your weight loss efforts if you aren’t careful with your fat intake.Fat is one of those tricky components of any weight loss endeavor because it contains more calories per gram than protein and carbs. In other words, a little fat goes a long way. First off, don’t buy the fat-laden sweets and snacks like pastries, chips, processed meats (e.g., bacon, sausage, and hot dogs), butter and full-fat dairy (e.g., whole milk, ice cream). If they aren’t in your house, you are less likely to eat them. Instead choose healthy fats from foods like salmon and tuna (fresh and canned in water), nuts/seeds, nut butters, avocado, and olive oil. Importantly, eating fewer saturated fats and choosing more unsaturated and essential fats can shift your body’s fat-burning mechanisms into high gear.Beverages can make or break your weight loss efforts.If you’re drinking sodas, Frappuccinos, lattes, and sweetened juice or energy drinks everyday, you could easily add more than 20 pounds to your body weight every year–from these liquids alone. Even if you’re exercising on a regular basis, consuming these high-calorie beverages means you’ll have to work extra hard to burn off these empty calories. Stick primarily to water, but mix it up with green tea and coffee (sweetened with a natural, no-calorie sweetener such as stevia if desired), non-fat milk or soymilk. For a special treat, try seltzer water with a splash of 100 percent fruit juice and a lemon, lime, or orange slice for extra zing.Wondering if you should forever avoid the snack aisle? Of course not!While processed snack foods can easily increase your daily calorie intake, if you are careful with portion sizes and make wise choices, then indulging in a healthy treat makes sense. Think 100 percent fruit sorbet, popcorn, trail mix, dried fruit (e.g., raisins, figs, dates), dark chocolate, non-fat frozen yogurt, and high-fiber muffins. Be sure to pair your snack with some produce and/or protein for staying power. For example, an apple and high fiber muffin.Don’t forget about freezer basics.Frozen fruits and vegetables provide a nourishing alternative to fresh produce and can help you prepare a healthy meal or snack when you’re in a pinch. Edamame (soybeans in the pod), peas, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, corn, and veggie stir-fry combos go from the freezer to plate in no time. Berries, pineapple, mango, and peaches are delicious to eat frozen right out of the bag or can be added to your favorite smoothie recipe.Having the right condiments and seasonings on hand can help you prepare tasty and healthy mealswithout added fat and sodium.Be sure to stock your pantry with low-sodium chicken and vegetable broth, claim juice, canned tomatoes and tomato paste, marinara sauce (no sugar added), light coconut milk (for soups and curries), low-sodium soy sauce, dijon mustard dry white wine, balsamic vinegar, fresh garlic and ginger, and a variety of dried herbs and spices (e.g., Italian blend, curry powder, chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, no-salt/no-MSG mixed herb seasoning).Source: Pure MattersCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

In 2011, the Legislature approved funding to pursue the project.AEA is conducting research in the area on wildlife, geology, water flow and fish. Its findings show that few salmon make it past the class-6 rapids where the dam would be built. As a result, the authority believes the hydroelectric project would be a safe and renewable resource."By understanding the environment a little more, we can help predict what impacts of the project might be," says Ford.Ford is optimistic that Susitna-Watana will be good for Alaska, but not everyone shares that optimism."I'm very challenged in my thinking to how they could go out and decimate a giant wilderness area on the Susitna River and call this green," says Stephen Mahay, the owner of Talkeetna-based Mahay Jet Boat Adventures. "It's about as far away from green energy as anything could be."Mahay says he's against the dam because of the harm it will do to the environment.  He says the state has other options."My concern is looking at the larger picture and looking at the future of the state of Alaska," Mahay said. "We have incredible quantities and hundreds of years of natural gas."AEA says there may be some tradeoffs, but that the positive outcomes of building the dam will far outweigh the negatives.“There is a construction period and there will have to be a physical project constructed, but we're talking about 100 years of clean, reliable power," Ford said.The project is still in its initial stages of research and more information is expected to be released by the beginning of next year.No email address was supplied by.

He says he's worried about low king salmon returns, and blames set nets for decimating the population."The 210-foot-long set nets are indiscriminate killers that catch everything that swims near them," Connors said.Connors says king salmon stocks in the Kenai River are at and all-time low."We are basically going to run out of king salmon in Cook Inlet if we don't do something about it. And that's why we need to be conservative at this time," Connors said.But Travis Every, a Kenai set netter, says when he fishes in the summer time, 98 percent of what he catches is sockeye.According to Every, the state has seen low king runs before. The population goes through cycles, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is already setting limits on set netters."The department is doing the best they can do as far as controlling us, because they have put severe restrictions on us," Every said. "You know, in 2012 I fished one day in July due to a king type issue."Every says there is room for everyone on the Kenai."I'm the last guy that wants anything to happen to this resource," Every said. "I'm a third-generation Cook Inlet fishermen, raising a fourth. I want this thing to be around for my kids and grandkids."AFCA wants to get its ballot initiative on the August 2016 primary ballot.If the ballot initiative goes through it would affect five non-subsistence areas including the Kenai Peninsula, among others.The Division of Elections must first certify the ballot initiative application.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

This unprecedented move leaves approximately 7,000 cable subscribers without Channel 2 News broadcasts and NBC entertainment and sports programming on GCI cable.<COL>Effective at midnight on November 8th, GCI removed KTUU-TV programming from its rural Alaska cable systems. This unprecedented move leaves approximately 7,000 cable subscribers without Channel 2 News broadcasts and NBC entertainment and sports programming on GCI cable.GCI imposed a November 8thdeadline for removing KTUU-TV’s signal in rural Alaska, despite KTUU-TV’s repeated offers of free carriage through 2014. “The bottom line is that its GCI’s doing and GCI’s decision,” says KTUU-TV marketing director Brad Hillwig. “GCI has chosen to unnecessarily put Alaskans in the middle of a complex negotiation that only impacts 2015 and beyond. We offered our signal for free through 2014 and GCI chose to reject that offer. We’re disappointed because it limits choice in rural Alaska.”The action comes at a time when GCI is entering the television news business by launching its own news product on KTVA in Anchorage. “That GCI appears intent on launching its own news product while simultaneously restricting access to KTUU-TV and Channel 2 News should cause Alaskan’s serious concern,” Hillwig stated. “KTUU-TV welcomes competition from all news outlets, including GCI’s own news products. However, we find these types of anti-consumer and anti-competitive tactics to be quite troubling.”During negotiations, GCI also threatened to end KTUU’s ability to distribute its programming on the Alaska Rural Communications Service (ARCS) on November 15th, by removing its signal from the satellite that feeds the popular rural network. The threat came despite numerous assurances from GCI officials that ARCS would continue to be a viable resource for Channel 2 News viewers in rural Alaska in the event of a GCI cable blackout.The affected communities are:  Barrow, Bethel, Cordova, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Nome, North Slope, Valdez, Adak, Akutan, Anaktuvuk Pass, Whittier, Galena, Unalaska, King Salmon, Kaktovik, McGrath, Nikolski, Chugach McKinley, Skagway, and Tanana.Viewers in these communities may also receive KTUU-TV on Dish Network, DirecTV and on the ARCS network. Channel 2 News is also available on Airwave -- a free live streaming and on demand mobile application available on iOS and Andriod.The failed negotiations also mean that southeast Alaska and Juneau may soon be without Channel 2 News, although the two parties agreed to extend the current agreement until November 22ndin order to discuss the terms of carriage going forward. If a deal is not reached by the deadline, Juneau and southeast residents would lose Channel 2 News on KATH-TV and KSCT-TV. GCI recently finalized its acquisition of KATH-TV in Juneau and its sister station KSCT-TV in Sitka, along with KTVA-TV in Anchorage. Prior to GCI’s acquisition of KATH-TV, KTUU-TV supplied Channel 2 News broadcasts to the Juneau station in a decade-old agreement with the former owners.Contacts:Brad Hillwig, Marketing Director KTUU-TV 762-9203bhillwig@ktuu.comAbout KTUU-TVKTUU-TV’s early beginnings date back to 1953. Over the ensuing six decades, the station has built a reputation of excellence as Alaska’s most watched news source, producing more than 22-hours of news and sports content each week on television. Online, KTUU.com has become a digital news leader, and Channel 2’s mobile News and Weather applications are on the leading edge of mobile journalism in Alaska.  Nielsen Media research shows that Channel 2 News products reach more than 89-percent of the adults who watch local news in a week, and more than 85-percent of those viewers watch Channel 2 News exclusively. That strong reach and brand loyalty are augmented by added distribution to the state’s capital and more than 244 rural communities throughout Alaska.No email address was supplied by.

KTUU-TV alleged that GCI threatened to end KTUU’s ability to distribute programming via ARCS, despite numerous assurances.On Friday evening, both parties agreed to extend the current agreement for carriage of Channel 2 News newscasts on KATH-TV in Juneau and KSCT-TV in Sitka until November 22.OnOctober 30, the Federal Communications Commission granted Denali Media Anchorage, Corp’s, a GCI subsidiary, acquisition of three TV stations, including KATH-TV in Juneau, KSCT-TV in Sitka and KTVA-TV, the Anchorage CBS affiliate.This is a developing story.

The charges include wire fraud, theft of government funds, Federal Employees’ Compensation Act fraud, and Social Security fraud.Assistant U.S. Attorney Yvonne Lamoreaux, the prosecutor in the case, says the case stems from a lower back injury Agcaoili began receiving Social Security and worker's comp payments for in November 2001. She refused to comment on whether any of those payments are considered fraudulent, with the case at hand only covering payments since Feb. 12, 2009."He was arrested yesterday, he was arraigned today, and a continuance hearing is set for Tuesday," Lamoreaux said.Prosecutors say Agcaoili collected at least $334,000 in payments since 2009, in what they call “a scheme to defraud the federal government about the nature and extent of his injury and about the other work he was performing and income he was receiving.”Agcaoili allegedly did additional jobs, including preparing income tax returns and immigration forms, but lied on federal forms and said he hadn’t had other work in order to still qualify for payments.“The indictment alleges that despite Agcaoili’s disability claims, Agcaoili went dipnetting and fishing on multiple occasions every summer between 2009 and 2013,” prosecutors wrote.In the statement, Kevin Feldis, chief of the criminal division of Loeffler’s office, says prosecutors are committed to fighting cases of fraud against the federal government.“Each time someone intentionally defrauds the United States in order to receive federal benefits, such as workers’ compensation and disability payments, it undermines the integrity of those federal programs, and harms all law-abiding citizens,” Feldis said.Both the Department of Labor Office of Workers’ Compensation Program and the Social Security Administration Disability Insurance Benefits program were allegedly defrauded in the case. Loeffler’s office credits inspectors general at both the USPS and Social Security with jointly conducting the investigation.Lamoreaux says that if convicted, Agcaoili would face prison time subject to federal sentencing guidelines. Those include maximum sentences of 20 years for each of 10 counts of wire fraud in the indictment, 10 years apiece for two counts of theft of government funds, and five years apiece for five counts of FECA fraud and one count of Social Security fraud.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

State Attorney General Michael Geraghty's office hasblasted the EPA's move as an example of federal overreach,saying that without an application from Pebble the EPA would be basing any decision on hypothetical assumptions.Murkowski says she supports the bill because the EPA needs to have boundaries, not specifically because of the situation involving Pebble."This is not about Pebble; this is about a process," Murkowski said. "I think it's important to recognize that there is a process through the Clean Water Act where the EPA can veto this project, but what this bill is designed to do is, is -- say if there is going to be a veto -- it need to be during that time period when there is actually an application."Some members of the resource-extraction industry say the process of permitting needs to be respected. At the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, general manager Rebecca Logan says the EPA's actions are hindering development. She says major companies will invest in other countries and the United States, and Alaska will lose jobs."People who are investing money have to have a certainty.," Logan said. "They have to know that if they invest money and do the right things, that they're going to be allowed to proceed."In the Bristol Bay area, some locals support the EPA's position. Brian Kraft, who owns three lodges in the region, is opposed to both Pebble and the Regulatory Fairness Act. He says the EPA should retain its right to restrict development before a permit is issued, because it could save the companies millions of dollars."It doesn't make any business sense at all to allow the business to go forward," Kraft said. "Go through all the steps, apply for the permit and get the permits from the (Army) Corp of Engineers -- and then after that, the EPA come in and tell them, 'Oh no, you shouldn't have that that permit.' So, in my opinion, knowing up front from the EPA is a good thing."The EPA says it stands bythe wording of Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act,which outlines the agency's relevant powers over projects. Under the section, after holding public hearings with appropriate notice, its administrator may prohibit or restrict projects upon determining that material discharges "will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas."Inan overview of Section 404(c) posted online (PDF),the EPA says it has "very sparingly" used its veto authority, employing it 13 times since 1972.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Fish and Game. "Getting the fish up to where they need to go is critical to continue the success of the species here."Last legislative session, the Mat-Su Borough received $2.5 million to help its fisheries management policy.“It has a lot to do with how the inlet is managed and where the commercial fishing takes place and what time of the season,” said Jim Colver, with Mat-Su Borough Wildlife Commission.The Borough says over a million dollars is spent each year fixing culverts. Fish passage is the primary concern when it comes to roads over fisheries. The Mat-Su Borough is also concerned with the actions of commercial fisheries.According to the state, there were thousands of culverts needing repair more than two decades ago. In 2013, the number is down to just a few hundred that need to be fixed."If there's salmon in them we're concerned about it," Benkert said. "Whether there's a run of 50 fish up it or 5,000 fish up it, they all contribute to the genetic diversity  of the stock."Here at the end of the season, parts of Alaska are judged by salmon run size. It's people's actions on both land and sea that affect the final verdict.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Currently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has authority to define fishing standards of sustainability.Alaska seafood groups have been using a standard established by the United Nations, instead of certification from the Marine Stewardship Council.Walmart has many contracts with the feds and has a policy that its fish must have approval by the MSC. The issue gained traction when Walmart announced that it might pull Alaska salmon from its store shelves.Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) has been critical of the nation’s largest retailer over certification and criticized MSC’s increasing cost for logo fees and inconsistent standards.On Tuesday, Sen. Begich chaired a hearing in Washington, D.C. on the topic of fishing sustainability and applauded the GSA’s guideline changes."It also showed to the private sector that there are ways to do sustainability certification without having to have a third party do it," said Sen. Begich. "So the private party still has to go through their part of what they need to do so their meeting with our Alaska group and I believe they'll come to a conclusion."A Walmart Senior Director of Sustainability said a decision on Walmart’s policy could come by the end of the year.Contact Mallory PeeblesCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

On Friday, the Campbell Creek Estuary had a ribbon cutting.“We're really excited to have this be part of Anchorage's park system because it provides this wildlife sanctuary right here in the middle of Anchorage,” said Phil Shephard, Executive Director with Great Land Trust.Five years in the making, GLT and Municipality of Anchorage raised money to build a trail head, parking lot, trails and overlooks to show off the estuary, downstream from Campbell Lake, where the creek meets Cook Inlet.“It’s an estuary that's really productive wetlands and so where all those salmon are coming up the belugas chase the salmon, so it’s very exciting to be able to see belugas out here,” said Shephard. “There's lots of water fowl and birds in the area.”The property has more than a mile of trails with the main loop being handicap accessible along with three overlooks.The estuary is located at 531 Selkirk Drive and is one of the few public access points to the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge and is known for attracting bald eagles, Sandhill cranes, river otters and five species of salmon.“It’s a quiet contemplative place where nature takes center stage,” said Shephard.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

This means that GCI's threat to take KTUU-TV off of its rural cable systems has been postponed until November 8th.The extension gives the parties an opportunity to negotiate to resolve the dispute that would affect some 7,000 Alaskans in rural areas. The November 8th extension date was chosen by GCI because it is the first day GCI can remove KTUU-TV’s NBC and Channel 2 News programming from GCI Cable systems in rural Alaska based on the regulatory requirement that subscribers receive a formal 30-day notice of the programming change.According to GCI’s statements, the company still plans to drop KTUU-TV in many rural Alaska communities unless a “fair and long-term agreement” is reached. KTUU-TV has offered to provide its signal to GCI for free in rural Alaska through 2014 to allow plenty of time to discuss business terms for 2015 and beyond. GCI has rejected that offer. Instead, GCI has tied viewership of KTUU-TV for rural residents to a long term deal for Anchorage, where the majority of subscribers reside.Viewers watch KTUU-TV more than any other channel on GCI's system. GCI has taken that content for free and re-sold it to customers. KTUU-TV is simply seeking fair value for the content it creates, said Brad Hillwig, KTUU-TV marketing director. KTUU-TV will continue to do everything possible to achieve a solution to this dispute. “All Alaskans deserve a choice in news and entertainment, particularly those that pay a cable company each month for that content,” Hillwig said. “A source of independent news is important everywhere, especially in rural Alaska where access to news, information and entertainment is far more limited than in urban areas,” Hillwig added.The affected communities would be: Barrow, Bethel, Cordova, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Nome, North Slope, Valdez, Adak, Akutan, Anaktuvuk Pass, Whittier, Galena, Unalaska, King Salmon, Kaktovik, McGrath, Nikolski, Chugach McKinley, Skagway, and Tanana.Viewers in these communities can also see KTUU-TV on Dish Network, DirecTV and on the public Alaska Rural Communication System (ARCS). Channel 2 News is also available on Airwave -- a free live streaming and on demand mobile application available on iOS and Andriod.Contacts:Brad Hillwig, Marketing Director KTUU-TV 762-9203bhillwig@ktuu.comAbout KTUU-TVKTUU-TV’s early beginnings date back to 1953.

The views presented Tuesday on a media tour were chilling: shredded homes and twisted cars.More than 10 days after a large section of a rain-soaked hill crashed down on a neighborhood in the small community of Oso, teams with cadaver dogs are still sifting through debris and soil to determine exactly how many people died in the March 22 mudslide.A mother and her son from Cordova are among the victims of the mudslide. Officials have confirmed Julie Farnes, 59, lost her life in the landslide, while her son Adam remains missing.KING Channel 5 in Washington reports Adam grew up fishing in Cordova and moved to Washington when his mother and father Gerald “Jerry” Farnes retired and purchased a home in Oso. Adam was at home with his mother when the slide occurred, according to KING. Gerald was not at home at the time of the slide.The mudslide partially dammed up the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing water to pool. Heavy rain last week added to the flooding. But early this week, the weather was dry and sunny - at least for a few days - allowing more crews to switch from water pumping to searching."A lot of logjam areas, that's where we're finding human remains," search effort division supervisor Steve Harris said on Tuesday.The National Weather Service forecast rain to return Thursday and Friday with a chance of showers through the weekend. Any rain complicates the job of workers in the muck and increases the risk of flooding.Here are some facts and observations in one of the worst natural disasters to hit Washington State in this century:THE DEAD:Officials have so far confirmed the deaths of 29 people, although only 22 have been officially identified in information released Wednesday morning by the Snohomish County medical examiner's office. They range in age from 4-month-old Sonoah Heustis to 71-year-old Lewis F. Vandenburg. A total of 18 people are missing. They range in age from 2-year-old Brooke Sillers to Bonnie J. Gullikson, 91. Some of the missing and dead are related.It's unclear whether any of the seven unidentified dead are among the 18 missing, joint information center spokeswoman Brielle Nicholas said Wednesday.THE MUDSLIDE SITE:From a vantage point about a mile from the collapsed hillside, the magnitude of the slide is chilling, even if only a part of it can be seen. Where there was a state highway, there's now a bed of mud and debris as much as 80 feet deep in some spots. There are few signs that a community existed here, replaced now by a field of debris of hundreds of acres. Heavy machinery is dwarfed by the mounds of mud. Crews wearing bright safety clothing trek carefully on paths made of plywood or through deep mud, using poles to assure their footing. Piles of downed trees and branches dot the brown mud field. What were houses, they're now shredded remains. Cars were pancaked and twisted."The mountain didn't slide like an avalanche that starts at the top and slides down. It actually blew out at the bottom. And all of that energy, because of the weight of top on it, blew across the river and brought all that water and material in it," said Lt. Richard Burke, a firefighter and incident spokesman.The valley then channeled the slide like a bowl.He added: "Like a big soup bowl, it kind of sloshed up the bank and came back down."Nothing has yet been removed from the field. The debris is contaminated with remains of septic tanks and other "contaminants" found in cars and garages. Crews have begun piling up trees and house items in different sections, Burke added.Said Harris: "It's very likely it (a lot of the stuff) won't be recovered. It's just buried there."THE SEARCH FOR HUMAN REMAINS:Crews are being careful in their search for human remains. Harris said boats with sonar are among the pieces of equipment put to use. "Everything moved so much across the landscape, where we find logs and debris is where we're going to find (remains)."The weather helped Tuesday. It was sunny and dry, a stark contrast to the first few days of the recovery operations when a significant percentage of rescue crew members had to focus on de-flooding the area. There were 270 tactical personnel and volunteers present."We've been able to channel the water. We got less folks controlling the water and more folks with their hands on the ground. And that's what we need," said Burke.The search is painstaking. In expanding their area, crews are using a grid system. But despite the progress, there are parts of the debris field that have not been examined because they are not yet stable.The rain, though, is forecast to come back. As much as 3 inches of rain are expected to fall between Thursday and Sunday.FINANCIAL COSTS:Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says the mudslide caused about $10 million in damage to homes destroyed in the slide area and their contents. He estimates further costs of $32.1 million for search and recovery efforts, and to remove all the debris. But he says the costs could go higher.HOW LONG WILL THE SEARCH LAST?Harris said: "From what I've seen, it's going to take a long time."Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Weather conditions were clear and calm at the time of the crash. There are no survivors from the incident."A National Transportation Safety Board on-scene investigation is expected to begin Thursday, with troopers saying logistical issues prevented them from reaching the crash site Wednesday.Clint Johnson, chief of the NTSB's Alaska section, says much remains to be discovered at the crash site.“It's very important to be able to look at the accident site, look at the area again," Johnson said. "Control positions, condition of the prop -- there's a lot that goes into the on-scene portion of the accident investigation.”Investigators will have to work with evidence largely burnt in a post-crash fire.“It obviously limits our ability to be able to look at that wreckage, and determine from looking at the wreckage," Johnson said. "However, there are still a lot of parts and pieces of the wreckage that have not burned, and that's what they're going to be centering on.”According to Troopers and Ravn Alaska, the two were on a pilot training flight when the crash occurred 30 miles southeast of Bethel. Weather conditions were clear and calm at the time of the crash.The wreckage was located at approximately 6:30 p.m. "Troopers arrived on scene and observed a large debris field, and the willows around the crash site were burned," AST wrote. "Troopers were able to locate remains in the wreckage."Troopers identified the plane as a Cessna 208. Its wreckage was reached by a Blackhawk Helicopter late Tuesday night near a fishing weir by Three Step Mountain. The wreckage contained human remains and there was a burned area around the aircraft and a large debris field.Smith said the Cessna Caravan was not being used for passenger service at the time of the crash.Records from the National Transportation Safety Board show that five of the last ten Cessna 208 crashes since 2003 have been operated by Hageland. Prior to Thursday's crash, the most recent was a November 2013 crash near the Yukon River community of St. Mary's that killed four.Troopers say they will return to the crash site Wednesday to further investigate and to attempt recovery of the men's remains. Next of kin have been notified.According to a release by Ravn Aviation, Cedars is survived by his wife and two children. McGee is survived by his wife.[ORIGINAL STORY April 8 7:38 p.m.] National Transportation Safety Board investigator Clint Johnson says it’s not clear when the Cessna 208 crashed, but responders are en route to the crash site.“There appears to have been a post-crash fire,” Johnson said.Peters says the plane was reported overdue to troopers as of 6:10 p.m., with responders taking a helicopter to the crash site in the vicinity of Three Step Mountain Tuesday night."Within the hour a local pilot reported to troopers that they had spotted a burning wreckage outside of Bethel," Peters wrote. "An Army (National) Guard Blackhawk with troopers and local fire personnel responded and found a wreckage."Another Hageland Aviation Cessna 208 crashed during a passenger flight near St. Mary’s on Nov. 29, killing four people and injuring six others. The NTSB is still investigating that crash, but said in a preliminary report in December thatwitnesses were concerned about the plane before it crashed,with radio attempts to contact the pilot unsuccessful.Hageland, along with Era Aviation and Frontier Flying Service,was part of a January rebranding effortin which the three entities planned to do business under the Ravn Alaska name. Era’s CEO, Bob Hajdukovich, denied at the time that the new name had any connection with the St. Mary’s crash.Johnson says investigator Chris Shaver is leaving for Bethel Tuesday and will hopefully reach the scene “first thing in the morning."According to Smith, Ravn is working with officials to investigate the crash."Hageland is gathering information and cooperating with local, state and federal authorities," Smith wrote. "More information will be provided as it becomes available."Channel 2's Jeff Bridges, Mike Ross, Kortnie Horazdovsky and Matthew Smith contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

These days you'll find him on his 15-year old purse seine vessel named Hogan Isle working the waters to catch fish. But sometimes the spectacular views make it hard to call it "work.""I've been to a lot of places in the world and I've never seen a place that can make your jaw hit your chest on a regular basis," Culbertson said.Culbertson says 25 years ago when the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into his beloved Prince William Sound, a future of uncertainty struck simultaneously.Hard lessons were learned a quarter of a century ago during what was then the biggest and most devastating oil spill North America had ever faced.The world got a real-time education as to what could and would happen if spill prevention and response plans were not in place. It's a motivating thought that's ever present in Culbertson's mind."There's an obligation on a different level, not necessarily a social pressure obligation but a responsibility of living here and recognizing what this place is," Culbertson said.Following the Valdez oil spill, Alyeska Pipeline's Ship Escort Response Vessel System--SERVS--began its "Vessels of Opportunity" program, an emergency response team made up of local fishermen, ready to jump in and help out in the event of a spill.Mike Day, SERVS operation manager, says the vessels are needed to operate response equipment like containment boom, skimmers and the hydraulic power packs the system uses to operate as well as the oil storage barges. It's these dedicated community members that turn in to first responders if another oil spill happened again."We teach them safety tools that we use in our industry to keep ourselves safe," Day said. "I think that if you ask them over the years we've probably actually changed the culture somewhat of the fishing industry in Alaska."SERVS expects to dispatch eight vessels within an hour of any incident. Over the next six hours, 60 more vessels would be in place to serve as the backbone for the response, with 185 additional vessels dispatched within the next 18 to 24 hours to join the effort. At any given time, SERVS says 279 vessels will be on-call ready to assist, including 500 local fishermen and their own vessels, all of which are contracted and trained in advance."You have a personal responsibility to get it to where it was and to keep it where it is and not let that sort of situation happen again," Culbertson said.But if it does happen again, Culbertson and his vessel "Hogan Isle" will be standing by ready to do their part.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The sounds of power boats, four-wheelers, barking dogs, greedy seagulls fighting over fish scraps-- they create the cacophony that is Kotzebue today. For me, it was a trip somewhere new. For Channel 2 photographer, Bronwyn Saito, it was a trip back home.Our assignment to tell the history of Kotzebue first took us to the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center, run by the National Park Service. Willie Goodwin, the native liaison for NPS and a long-time member of Kotzebue's village elders council, has a wealth of knowledge of Kotzebue's most recent history. He spoke about the exhibits in the center that are aimed to help visitors learn about the importance of subsistence, a tenet of the Inupiat culture, still being practiced today. The exhibits display the food sources by season. Caribou and salmon are staples in the subsistence diet. But Goodwin says just as Kotzebue has changed, so have the migration patterns of the animals they rely on."We watch these changes you know. We know what's happening with climate change because the animals tell us," Goodwin said.Goodwin explained traditions have rarely wavered, through the missionary settlement by Russians in the late 1800s and the influx of government and military presence in the mid-1900s. In fact, Kotzebue has long served as a gathering place for trade and transportation, he said. Every summer for centuries, thousands of people traveled from all over Alaska and Russia for the annual trade fair."They traded for things that helped them survive through the winter and in their daily lives. It was the largest gathering of Inupiat Eskimos in the whole world," Goodwin said.The trade fair continues to this day.Goodwin spoke about the Inupiat culture of living off the land and sea, which led us to meet Ada Cleveland.Cleveland spends her summer days on the shore, cleaning, cutting and drying the salmon that find their way into her net. The squawking seagulls stand by, waiting to get their share. Ada jokes about how everyone in Kotzebue, including the dogs and seagulls, all want a piece."Would you believe I have guard dogs? No, I'm joking, they're seagulls,” Cleveland said. “They're hungry! They wait; they know.”While she's not too eager to share her catch with the seagulls, sharing is important to Cleveland and many others who practice subsistence in Kotzebue. A lot of what she catches is given to local elders."They're the ones that taught us how to live off the land,” she said. “So we've got to give them back something for showing us their knowledge.”She examined the hanging salmon, pointing out the fish oil that drips during the smoking process. She plans to vacuum-seal most of it and freeze it for winter. Inside the dry rack, burning stinkweed choked the salty air with smoke. Ada says green stinkweed doesn't fully ignite, that's why it's perfect for smoking salmon. But anywhere she goes, the smell of smoke lingers in her clothes – she says she always smells like it. We did too after spending some time with her.Out on the arctic tundra, the very spongy ground is speckled with ripe blueberries. We tried to watch our step so we didn't crush too much of the fruit that draws locals. One woman we met while picking berries said they were a lot larger this year, mainly due to the warm summer that Kotzebue had. Her hands were slightly stained purple.The next day we met Polly Schaeffer who was berry-picking with her niece visiting from Anchorage. She gathered the blueberries in her aimmaq, a birch basket made specifically for berry-picking. She plans to make jam and freeze the rest of the berries.We learned that the tundra holds a lot more than just blueberries: There are salmonberries, cranberries and blackberries that grow sweeter as the weather cools. But Schaeffer also pointed out Labrador tea -- or as the locals call it tundra tea. Tundra tea is used for drinking and medicinal purposes. The popular arctic herb has a crisp, distinct smell that drifts across the tundra breeze."That's the first thing you smell after the snow goes out," Schaeffer said.Locals enjoy spending time in Kotzebue's backyard. On this day, it was sunny, slightly breezy and people were taking advantage of the good weather -- perhaps one of the final few warm days of the season. Schaeffer says there are many financial benefits of subsistence, and of course, health benefits too."There are lots of vitamins and anti-oxidants in the berries -- really healthy for people,” Schaeffer said. “And look at all this fresh air we're getting. And you get the exercise.”As Bronwyn and I spent time with Schaeffer, we couldn't help but pick a few berries ourselves. There is a pleasant, isolated feeling out there on the vast tundra. I can imagine that it's somewhat similar to what life is like in Kotzebue, 33 miles above the Arctic Circle.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

She calls it Fishalicious.During the summer lunch hours, she sold her food on the corner of W 6th Ave and E Street near Town Square in Downtown.On Thursdays, Fishalicious joins other local food vendors at the Spenard Food Truck Carnival in the Chilkoot Charlie's parking lot.On Saturdays, Fishalicious was also part of the locally beloved Spenard Farmer's Market, which is also located near the windmill at Koots."It's too beautiful, so this was perfect," Jody said.

They argue it wrongly elevates the borough's role above the state's role in overseeing natural resources.The Anchorage Daily News reports the state also has told Suddock the proposed Pebble Mine couldn't be developed if the initiative stands.A borough attorney told Suddock Wednesday that with the initiative, the borough isn't prohibiting mining but prohibiting harm to salmon.No email address was supplied by.

The truck’s bed reportedly caught the lines, pulling them out and damaging several of the poles they were attached to.This is a developing story.

Oceana says its numbers come from the National Marine Fisheries Service’s own 2010 data.“The value (of the discarded halibut) is worth more than the fish they’re going after,” said Jon Warrenchuk, a marine scientist with Oceana.“This level of high bycatch affects fish populations, and we’d rather be making use of the fish we catch and count (them) toward sustaining populations,” he added.Warrenchuk said the waste acts as a “double whammy” for halibut.“Most of the fish caught are young, and they haven’t spawned yet, but they are big enough to run the gauntlet and not get eaten by predators,” he said. That means some of the most mature fish that have survived the perils of the wild are then caught and discarded by the trawl bycatch before they can reproduce.Warrenchuk said Oceana is calling on federal fishery managers to reduce bycatch as much as possible—for example, by closing areas with high bycatch during the trawl fishery—in order to reduce the impact of even the “inherently dirty” non-selective fisheries.In a Friday statement, NOAA Fisheries Assistant Administrator Eileen Sobeck defend the group’s bycatch practices and said reducing bycatch “remains a top issue” for NOAA Fisheries.The agency said success can be seen in “Alaska longline fishing and seabird numbers (are) down by 50 percent due to streamer lines,” and touted other bottom trawl fisheries, including the West Coast groundfish trawl, as seeing reduced bycatch numbers.Warrenchuk said, despite the promises from NOAA to reduced bycatch, simple measures like closing areas with high bycatch are still not able to be employed.“This has larger ecological aspects, when millions of pounds of fish are discarded,” he said. “That changes food web.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They hunted for ducks, sea lions. They caught fish. Carlough said they didn't eat at a certain time; they ate when they were hungry.“We lived off the land, you know,” Carlough said.On Good Friday in 1964, the earth started shaking. Carlough and her sister were bathing their small children. They dressed quickly. Carlough said she didn’t have time to put a diaper on her baby daughter. They slipped on dresses and left.Carlough ran to her house to get more clothes for her baby when she met her father.“My daddy told me, ‘Sally don’t stay too much in the house,’” Carlough said.He told her to be aware of a big wave; Carlough says he didn't call it a tidal wave or tsunami, since he spoke in Aleut. She ran uphill to get away from the incoming water, remembering that it’s hard to run with children. Her son didn’t understand why they were running.“When something happens like that, you don’t have time to be scared --your mind just goes blank,” Carlough said.Carlough stopped at that part of the story. Her eyes welled up. She was 21 years old then, and it’s been 50 years since.“I don’t know if I could talk about it,” Carlough said. “Even after so many years.”From higher ground, Sally watched the tsunami sweep in and destroy her home. There were lakes on the island, she said, but the giant wave filled them with seawater. She describes looking back at the water and seeing a giant green wave rushing toward them.“I guess it wasn’t our time to go,” Carlough said.She said it seemed as if the wave could have just washed over all of them.The waves killed three people from the village. One was her relative, Zaedar Anakenty. It was a big loss for her community which was fewer than 20 people. A list of names collected by Coleen Mielke said Anakenty was with three other men who were preparing to evacuate women and children off the hill to get them away from the tsunami.When the waves subsided, Carlough’s father led the family in prayer. He was a Russian Orthodox reader. They sang hymns meant to comfort those in great stress. The family spent the night on the hill they escaped to. Carlough said the children were miserable and cold. She held them and used body heat to keep them warm. Carlough said they all huddled under a tarp.Relief came in the form of a small skiff that transported the survivors from the island to another ship. They went from the ship to Kodiak. Carlough said she was numb and confused. They had their first meal in days at the base; she could barely eat, but she was grateful for a chance to feed her children. Carlough said reporters asked her questions while she ate, but she didn't know what to say to them.From there on, everything in Carlough’s world changed. She spent a month in Anchorage where, she said it was so different.“We were just Natives,” Carlough said. “I thought my life would be just simple.”In Anchorage, she had to adjust to a culture that was largely foreign to her.“We had to do everything the white people way, which we didn’t understand much because we were just a small community, of Kaguyak,” Carlough said.There wasn’t much left on the island. Carlough and her family dressed in donated clothing when they got to Kodiak. In Anchorage a newspaper photographer took a picture of Carlough and her two small children. That photo is one of her most treasured possessions.“I’ve always cherished this because it reminds me so much of the earthquake,” Carlough said.It is one of two physical reminders Carlough has left of that place. The other is a miniature laminated birth certificate card. Carlough’s brother-in-law found it long after the tsunami, when he was crab fishing in the area. The card, sent to Kaguyak from Juneau, is the only thing Carlough has left from her former village.Eventually, Carlough and her family resettled in Akhiok. She said they had many of the same subsistence activities, but it wasn't the same. Some of Carlough’s relatives relocated to Old Harbor.“It was really hard to move to a village that’s no yours,” Carlough said. “Everybody has rules.”Carlough said she did better after she got used to the new village. She had a chance to eat the foods she loved and lived how she had grown up.Now, when Carlough sees news of disasters on TV, she always feels for people who become refugees, victims of the whims of a wild planet.“I wouldn't want anyone to go through what we went through,” Carlough said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the Parnell Administration’s appeal of what is known as the Katie John case.The news was well received by Alaska Native leaders and family of the late Katie John."I just want to say thank you, thank you to everyone and I just thank the Lord for this day,” said John’s granddaughter Katherine Martin.John was an Athabascan elder who, along with other Alaska Natives, went to court to bring Alaska's navigable waters under the definition of public lands -- allowing for a rural subsistence priority.Monday’s decision by the Supreme Court upholds rulings of lower courts enforcing a subsistence priority for rural Alaskans.Federal law mandates a rural preference for hunting and fishing resources under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, known as ANILCA. The state had argued that navigable waters shouldn't be subject to federal jurisdiction as they have been since 1999.The Alaska Federation of Natives says it is extending its hand to the state to find a solution to food security for Alaska Natives.“We are hopeful that this opens up a new and better chapter with our relationship with the State of Alaska,” said AFN President Julie Kitka.The state Department of Law reacted to the announcement in a written statement Monday.“The State is disappointed today by the news that the Supreme Court has denied hearing the case between the State of Alaska and the Department of Interior and will not move forward to clarify the lines of management authority between the state and federal subsistence programs in Alaska," officials wrote. "Until this ambiguity can be removed and a clear definition of jurisdiction can be drawn, the dual management program will continue to lead to litigation and further uncertainty to the detriment of the Alaskan people as a whole."The AFN says it will double its efforts to protect the rights of Alaska Natives.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The above-ground option would cost an estimated $261 million.“We originally looked at a below-ground pipeline and determined that it wasn't feasible because of ground movement, primarily due to permafrost conditions, the normal freeze, thaw-off cycle, which could cause rupturing of the line,” Hall said.Hall says extensive monitoring of the creek is continuing, and thus far the Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Environmental Conservation do not object to the mine’s current handling of the situation.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

According to storytellers, Eklutna gets its namesake from an angry fish.“Up at Eklutna Lake, there were two little girls out there fishing and they saw a little fish and they were laughing, making fun of it, funny little fish,” said Lee Stephan, President Traditional Tribal Council.  “The momma fish saw that, so she swam around the lake to make a big wave and swamp the kids and drowned them."It was in her anger that two rocks were washed out and fell near the mouth of the river, and that's how Eklutna got its name.While the culture and identity have remained the same over the years, the village that was once home to hundreds and these days, only 35 people live there a year round.“If you look around this village, we've got a highway there, natural gas there, railroad over there, militaries going on, all kinds of things happened to us, we didn't have a lot of say in it, it just become,” Stephan said.While rapid growth has brought change to this small village just outside of Anchorage, it’s the brightly colored spirit houses that are believed to date back to the 1600’s that attract an estimated 10-to-20 thousand visitors from all over the world to Eklutna annually.“The spirit houses were a (Dena’ina) Athabascan tradition, before they received orthodox Christianity they felt the spirit, when someone died the spirit hovered above the grave and they gave it a place to dwell," said Father Mikel Bock, St. Nicholas Orthodox Church.Villagers believe that the spirit stays on this earth for 40-days and 40-nights following their loved ones death, and according to Stephan, rather than have a dead relative live with them while the human spirit is still on this earth, they decided to build them spirit houses.It’s a place to not only house their loved ones spirit, but also their cherished possessions."Their gun, their knife, their books, whatever they had of value we would put in them houses so they could have a place of their own,” said Stephan.Spirit houses painted a variety of colors that represent the different clans in the village."You'll find houses inside of houses, that's a mother and child that passed away,” Stephan said.  “You'll find houses with fences around them, that's someone that don't live here and the more elaborate the house is made has to do with the grieving of the person who built the house."Today, more than 60 spirit houses fill the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church Cemetery today, but Bock says there are many more people buried in the cemetery.Originally, Bock says spirit houses were meant to deteriorate, and over the years without proper upkeep, that’s exactly what has happened.ContactBlake Essig(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

John Renner has been fishing for 47 years and counting. He says without commercial fishing many like he and his family would not survive."I'm a second generation fisherman, and my son is a third generation," Renner said. "We are coming off a bumper crop this year -- a bumper harvest -- and if we don't sell this stuff we are going to be in trouble."The problem for folks like Renner centers upon Walmart's current policy: It requires a certification from the Marine Stewardship Council that promotes sustainable fish.Alaska industry groups use a different standard that was established by the United Nations.Renner explained that means there's not a lot of Alaskan fish on Walmarts shelves."They are selling a small amount of product for one processor, but there are 10, 15 more that they are not selling product for," Renner said. "That's the problem, we want to see our product back in their store."Walmart officials have noted when it comes to fishing sustainability, nothing has changed. Company officials note they carry Alaska fish in their stores.In a written statement Walmart officals noted, "We continue to source salmon from Alaska and have not changed our policies or practices around how we source seafood.”But for those who catch their seafood here in Alaska, they say their standards and their fish are exactly the same."We have a culture of sustainability and Walmart executives need to know what the reality is," said Chip Treinen, who fishes in Bristol Bay.Which is why these fishermen hope the decision to sell all Alaska's fish is a no brainer."Just accept accreditation from another agency that does the same exact thing as the Marine Stewardship Council," Renner said, speaking to Walkmart’s position. "That's what we’re asking. Allow us access back into the retail market."Officials from the State of Alaska as well as members of the seafood industry will meet with the company at Walmart headquarters in Arkansas to talk about certification standards on Thursday.Contact Corey Allen-YoungFriend Corey on FacebookFollow Corey on TwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Fish and Game. "Getting the fish up to where they need to go is critical to continue the success of the species here."Last legislative session, the Mat-Su Borough received $2.5 million to help its fisheries management policy.“It has a lot to do with how the inlet is managed and where the commercial fishing takes place and what time of the season,” said Jim Colver, with Mat-Su Borough Wildlife Commission.The Borough says over a million dollars is spent each year fixing culverts. Fish passage is the primary concern when it comes to roads over fisheries. The Mat-Su Borough is also concerned with the actions of commercial fisheries.According to the state, there were thousands of culverts needing repair more than two decades ago. In 2013, the number is down to just a few hundred that need to be fixed."If there's salmon in them we're concerned about it," Benkert said. "Whether there's a run of 50 fish up it or 5,000 fish up it, they all contribute to the genetic diversity of the stock."Here at the end of the season, parts of Alaska are judged by salmon run size. It's people's actions on both land and sea that affect the final verdict.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Mageik and flown to King Salmon,” Peters said in a brief update on Saturday.STORY UPDATED AT 11:25 a.m. at 9/6/13:Alaska Air National Guard rescue crews are trying Friday to reach three occupants of a helicopter stranded by poor weather since Wednesday night on a volcano in the Alaska Peninsula.According to a Friday AST dispatch, Dillingham troopers were informed at about 6:25 p.m. Wednesday that an Egli Air Haul Inc. Bell 206B3 helicopter, piloted by company president Sam Egli and carrying passengers Taryn Lopez and John Paskieitch, were trapped at Mount Mageik’s 8,500-foot level in Katmai National Park and Preserve.The Associated Press reports that freezing rain iced on the helicopter and grounded Egli along with Lopez and Paskieitch, researchers who were working on volcano-monitoring equipment.“(Egli, Lopez and Paskieitch) have remained with the helicopter since the weather system settled on the mountain,” troopers wrote. “They are reported to have provisions and are in good condition with no reported injuries or damage to the helicopter.”With troopers unable to reach the site due to poor weather, the 11th Air Force’s Rescue Coordination Center sent an Air National Guard HH-60 Pave Hawk and HC-130 search plane, but they also couldn't get to the chopper.As of 10:15 a.m. Friday, troopers report that Guard aircraft were making a second attempt to reach the helicopter’s landing site.Egli Air Haul representatives didn't have immediate comment on the stranding Friday.In July, poor weather stranded seven people on board a Talkeetna Air Taxi flight on Ruth Glacier near Mount McKinley. They were eventually flown out by rescuers after spending four days on the glacier, during which they used supplies from the de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver.Editor's Note: KTUU's Neil Torquiano contributed to a Saturday update of this story.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Mageik, right on the edge of the caldera,” Egli said. “It had been logging data there for the last couple of months and it was time to go pull the station out of there.”Mount Mageik is located about 280 miles southwest of Anchorage at the 8,500-foot level in Katmai National Park and Preserve.According to Egli, they went in with good weather on the north side, however there were some clouds on the south side of the mountain spilling over the peak. He stayed in the helicopter to monitor the weather and situation, while the volcano researchers packed up the equipment.“There would be a small cloud that would blow across temporarily restricting our visibility and a minute or two it would blow away that happened three or four times over a period of probably 30 minutes I would guess and then more persistent, a larger cloud came across us that restricted our visibility right down to about zero,” Egli said.Egli has flown planes and helicopters for 31 years in Alaska with more than 22,000 pilot hours in various planes and helicopters.“I was watching what was going on and I could see ice building up on the rotor blades, so I called out to the volcano guys,” Egli said. “They immediately changed gears to get everything put away so we could evacuate fast instead of finishing the job.“I cranked up the helicopter and we were at that time in very low visibility in this freezing fog situation that had blown in on us, so I just had rotors spooled up ready for takeoff for the next instant when clearing would come, so we could dive off the mountain, but that clearing never came when that cloud came in on top of us it stayed and it continued to generate ice.”Egli says he ran the helicopter for about 12 minutes at full RPM, but realized the too much ice was building up and the helicopter would not have enough power to perform a takeoff. He rolled the throttle back to idle and announced they were stuck.“We shut down and spent the next hour probably getting the ice cleaned off of the rotor blades that had built up during that short ground run and we were ready to attempt another takeoff if it cleared up, but as we waited for it to clear up, the icing conditions continued to persist,” Egli said.He recalled that if they got trapped with icing conditions then they would be stuck for at least the night.“I was concerned about the safety and comfort of my passengers of course, so it was a reluctant choice that I had to make but it was the right choice, Egli said. “It was the only choice that we could make.”He began flying airplanes back in 1970 in Utah and flew helicopters with the Utah Army National Guard throughout the Rocky Mountain Region from 1979 until 1982.According to troopers, poor weather hampered initial rescue efforts by the 11th Air Force’s Rescue Coordination Center via an Air National Guard HH-60 Pave Hawk and HC-130 search plane.“We spent time on the satellite phone or on the radio, communicating with rescue efforts, communicating with family, coworkers,” Egli said. “There were many people involved on the ground in their various capacities with that effort; we couldn't just keep a telephone turned on all the time we had to conserve battery life not knowing how long the ordeal might last.”He says they would check the weather periodically to pass weather updates on to rescuers. They also chipped ice off the aircraft and put it in their water bottles and incubated them inside their sleeping bags to melt the ice to drinkable water.On Friday, the RCC told troopers they rescued all three people around 5 p.m. and they were flown from Mt. Mageik to King Salmon.“We're extremely grateful to the Air National Guard for their effort," Egli said, also noting the efforts of his two passengers. “[…] had they not been on task as diligently as they were, we'd probably still be out there today cause the weather's still bad."He says plans are in the works to retrieve the helicopter from the volcano once the weather is clear enough.“I’ve been stuck with bad weather a few times, not stuck on the mountain top like that - that was a new experience for me,” Egli said.Contact Neil TorquianoCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

DeVuyst says the helicopter had returned to base, with the Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley arriving at about 4:30 p.m.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the missing man,”Chief Petty Officer Chris Cole, a 17th District command center watchstander, said in Wednesday night's statement. “The decision to end a search is one of the most difficult choices to make as a search and rescue controller.”There was also no progress inthe search for 52-year-old Ketchikan man John Anderson,apparently overboard from his houseboat in the Tongass Narrows. Ketchikan police found the 40-foot Diver III adrift Wednesday morning, having dragged its anchor in 35 mph winds gusting to 70 mph.DeVuyst didn't immediately have full details on the Ketchikan search late Wednesday, beyond the fact that it had ended."It was suspended pretty late this evening," DeVuyst said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Command has also made the decision to start downsizing the amount of crews battling the blaze. Command has already begun bringing back crews who have been camped within the refuge. Those crews have come from many of Alaska’s rural areas as well as the Lower 48. Weston said those crews are expected to continue leaving the area, back to Anchorage where they will be flown back home.At the height of the fire, as many as 760 crewmembers were battling the blaze. As of Tuesday there were still 330 crewmembers battling the Funny River fire. Weston expects that number to continue to decrease in the coming days.The fire has been costly, Weston admits, with current projections totaling as much as $9.37 million spent battling the burn. Much of that cost has been to pay for air resources necessary to address the inaccessible areas much of the fire has affected, as well as deploy crews into those areas, Weston said.Fish and Wildlife Services are continuing the investigation into the cause of the fire, with few new details to emerge. The only thing that is known at this time regarding the cause, Weston said, is that it was human-caused. Officials have been able to rule out the possibility the blaze was caused by camp fire.Luckily crews were able to determine a general area of the fire's origin, said Steve Miller, Refuge assistant manager. At the fire's onset, aerial crews were able to see smoke from a specific area, making it easy now for crews to scour that area for clues.While evidence has been discovered, whether it is connected to this fire has yet to be determined, Miller said."I can't speak to the type of evidence, but (crews) are looking for something unnatural," Miller said. "How it got there, that's all to be determined."Officials don't want to disclose the type of evidence crews have discovered, Miller said. Nothing has been ruled out. Alternatively, nothing empirical has been discovered either, and "who knows if we'll ever come to that conclusion?" Miller said.Any members of the public who may have seen a suspicious vehicle or people along the Funny River Road area, specifically around the time of 3 p.m. till 4:30 p.m. on May 19 when the fire began can call 907-262-4453 with their information.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Warren Tanner, 75, was arrested Friday in North Pole. He was arraigned Saturday on six counts of sexual abuse of a minor.According to charging documents, authorities allege the abuse started as early as 2003 and occurred as recently as 2011.Court records show that the victim’s mother found text messages on her 14-year-old daughter’s cell phone “indicating she had been sexually abused” by Tanner.A police affidavit states that the messages “stated the abuse had taken place from the time (the victim) was three or four years old and continued until she was 11-12 years old.”During her interview, the victim disclosed “numerous incidents of sexual contact” with Tanner over several years. All but one incident took place at Tanner’s home, the victim reported. That incident outside the home allegedly took place in Tanner’s RV “during a fishing trip to Valdez when (the victim) was 11-12 years old.”On Friday Feb. 21 the victim’s mother confronted tanner about the abuse. The police report indicates Tanner admitted to the mother the abuse took place, but Tanner refused to turn himself in to Troopers and instead said he would seek counseling regarding the alleged abuse.Tanner is being held in the Fairbanks Correctional Center on no bail.

Another was found in May.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist Dave Csepp says ragfish can reach seven feet.They are common off the Bering Sea slope and hang out in waters exceeding 4,600 feet.The floppy, limp fish are long like a salmon but their skeletons are mainly cartilage. Csepp says a rap on the head with a salmon club probably would cut right through a ragfish.NOAA Fisheries spokeswoman Julie Speegle says ragfish have no scales and their skin resembles a squid's. They feed on small fish and cephalopods and are eaten by sperm whales.No email address was supplied by.

Rich Taro found it and won Seward's 58th Silver Salmon Derby.<COL>For the past nine days, nearly 7,000 anglers have been scouring Resurrection Bay for a $10,000 salmon. Rich Taro found it and won Seward's 58th Silver Salmon Derby."I knew it was big when I caught it," Taro said laughing. "After I found out it may be a winner, well then it was time for a round of drinks."The salmon Taro caught turned out to be the third largest salmon ever reeled in at the derby, tipping the scale at 21.25 lbs. Taro may have caught the biggest, but according to the Seward Chamber of Commerce, the coho salmon are getting bigger.Over the past three years both the total number of pounds of salmon caught in the derby and the average size of the fish have increased dramtically. This year there were 7,000 pounds of additionally caught salmon compared to 2012, and the average size of the salmon was almost one pound heavier."Coho are really heavily reliant on the ocean conditions that are taking place in the summer," Dept. Fish and Game Biologist Dan Bosch said. "The fish that went to the ocean last year obviously had some really good conditions. I would say it's warmer conditions but I don't know for sure."Dan Bosch says two factors limit coho salmon: the conditions of when the smolt first arrive in the ocean and if they can survive their first winter.To secure the longevity of the derby, Seward's Chamber of Commerce makes an annual investment on coho salmon smolt. At the Trail Lakes Hatchery 30 miles north of Seward, it costs about 50 cents per salmon smolt. This year the Chamber bought 50,000 smolt or $25,000 worth."If you were to remove those enhanced salmon from the system, the amount of fish returning to resurrection bay would be reduced and the derby would be affected dramatically," Trail Lakes Hatchery's Gary Fandrei said.The Chamber says the bigger the fish, the larger the derby crowd and with the way things are going now, next year Seward could reel in a big return on both.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Earlier this summer, Walmart did the exact same thing by refusing to buy anything that didn't have the MSC label.The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says because of shifting standards in that program, Alaska's fisheries dropped out of that certification in favor of the Responsible Fishery Management certification system that analyzes each of Alaska's rivers separately.ASMI's executive director Michael Cerne says there is frustration over what's going on because the state's focus has always been on creating a pristine and sustainable environment."It's been frustrating, nobody is really arguing against the management of the fishery, everybody is realizing including the MSC that it’s one of best managed fisheries in the world and the vast majority of customers are still continuing to buy it," Cerne said."We've proudly sourced salmon from the state of Alaska for many years,” Walmart said in a statement. “We want to continue to source quality seafood from Alaska for years to come while also ensuring sustainable seafood is available to future generations. That's why we have been and will continue to be engaged in open and transparent dialogue with Alaska fisheries, suppliers, NGOs, industry experts and government to push everyone toward a solution."Calls for a response from Sodexo USA were not returned.On Aug. 16, Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) sent a letter to Sodexo's president asking him to include Alaska's salmon as part of their purchases.Contact Corey Allen-YoungCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

According to storytellers, Eklutna gets its namesake from an angry fish.“Up at Eklutna Lake, there were two little girls out there fishing and they saw a little fish and they were laughing, making fun of it, funny little fish,” said Lee Stephan, President Traditional Tribal Council.  “The momma fish saw that, so she swam around the lake to make a big wave and swamp the kids and drowned them."It was in her anger that two rocks were washed out and fell near the mouth of the river, and that's how Eklutna got its name.While the culture and identity have remained the same over the years, the village that was once home to hundreds and these days, only 35 people live there a year round.“If you look around this village, we've got a highway there, natural gas there, railroad over there, militaries going on, all kinds of things happened to us, we didn't have a lot of say in it, it just become,” Stephan said.While rapid growth has brought change to this small village just outside of Anchorage, it’s the brightly colored spirit houses that are believed to date back to the 1600’s that attract an estimated 10-to-20 thousand visitors from all over the world to Eklutna annually.“The spirit houses were a (Dena’ina) Athabascan tradition, before they received orthodox Christianity they felt the spirit, when someone died the spirit hovered above the grave and they gave it a place to dwell," said Father Mikel Bock, St. Nicholas Orthodox Church.Villagers believe that the spirit stays on this earth for 40-days and 40-nights following their loved ones death, and according to Stephan, rather than have a dead relative live with them while the human spirit is still on this earth, they decided to build them spirit houses.It’s a place to not only house their loved ones spirit, but also their cherished possessions."Their gun, their knife, their books, whatever they had of value we would put in them houses so they could have a place of their own,” said Stephan.Spirit houses painted a variety of colors that represent the different clans in the village."You'll find houses inside of houses, that's a mother and child that passed away,” Stephan said.  “You'll find houses with fences around them, that's someone that don't live here and the more elaborate the house is made has to do with the grieving of the person who built the house."Today, more than 60 spirit houses fill the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church Cemetery today, but Bock says there are many more people buried in the cemetery.Originally, Bock says spirit houses were meant to deteriorate, and over the years without proper upkeep, that’s exactly what has happened.Contact Blake EssigCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Neri, Pure MattersWhen do you need a vitamin or a supplement? Some researchers say that a daily multivitamin may be a good idea for most adults, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.That's not to say you should abandon good nutrition in your daily diet. If you eat a varied diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, you're likely to get all the vitamins and minerals that you need.If you take a dietary supplement that focuses just on one or two nutrients, you may end up with too much of those nutrients, interfering with the absorption of other nutrients.Vitamins are complex organic micronutrients, which is a fancy way of saying that they work at the microscopic level to help your body carry on complex chemical processes. They have no calories themselves, and with a few exceptions, they're not manufactured inside your body. Some vitamins help in biochemical transformations, such as absorbing oxygen in the lungs. Others act as "antioxidants," protecting tissues from disease-causing damage and premature aging.Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic elements your body needs to function. Minerals allow the body to build some structures and help trigger some bodily reactions. Iron, for example, is a key to the production of hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Calcium is used to build bone and tissues. Zinc is essential for nerve transmission. Compared with vitamins, minerals have a very simple molecular structure. And unlike some vitamins, cooking does not destroy their essential nutrients.Here's a look at some of the important vitamins:Some people can benefit from taking a supplement in addition to a healthy diet, however. According to the American Dietetic Association, a vitamin supplement may be helpful if you fit any of the following profiles:If you believe you should take vitamin supplements, talk with your doctor or dietitian to make sure you are taking the correct amount and that the supplements are not causing an interaction with medications you take or conditions you have.Source: Pure MattersCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

Women also are more likely than men to develop an eating disorder, which makes it difficult to maintain healthy nutrition.Here are six nutrients that women are often deficient in, either because they lose too much of a nutrient, don't get enough of a nutrient, or both.Why you need it:Calcium builds teeth and bones, curbs premenstrual syndrome, helps maintain normal blood pressure and may protect against colon cancer.  It is also needed for muscle contraction, hormones and enzymes, and nervous system function, according to the American Dietetic Association (ADA). Nearly all of the body's calcium is stored in the teeth and bones.Women's risk for bone loss rises at menopause with waning levels of estrogen, a hormone that helps keep calcium in your bones. Getting adequate calcium, vitamin D and exercise as a child and teen can lessen the impact of bone loss later in life, the National Osteoporosis Foundation says.What you need:1,000 mg a day for women of childbearing age; 1,200 mg a day after menopause.The problem:More than three out of four women don't get the recommended amount of calcium, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), part of the National Institutes of Health. Many weight-conscious women forgo dairy products, calcium's richest source. Even when women include dairy products in their diet, however, the amount of calcium they absorb can be affected by age, pregnancy and the amount of vitamin D they consume, the ODS says. The amount of calcium you absorb declines with age. Although some plant-based foods, such as spinach and collard greens, contain significant amounts of calcium, this source of calcium may not be absorbed as well as the calcium found in dairy products.The remedy:Choose more dairy foods. A cup of low-fat yogurt, milk or cottage cheese provides about 300 mg of calcium. Good nondairy choices include kale, turnip greens, almonds, dried figs and fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals and fruit juices. Weight-bearing exercise like brisk walking prevents calcium loss from bones. Research has shown that for women at risk for fractures, taking calcium and vitamin D supplements alone after menopause is not enough to protect against fractures. Additional medicines may be necessary. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables and regular weight-bearing exercise are essential to bone health for women of all ages.Why you need it:Vitamin D helps the body maintain normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and helps form and maintain strong bones, the ODS says. It also may help maintain a healthy immune system and help healthy cell growth and development. It helps prevent rickets, a condition in children that weakens the bones. There is also evidence that vitamin D may help prevent falls by improving muscle strength.What you need:200 IU a day for women up to age 50, 400 IU for ages 51 to 70 and 600 IU for those 71 and older. For women older than 60 and for women with additional risk factors for osteoporosis or a low intake of calcium and vitamin D, 600 to 800 IU may be needed.The problem:The primary source of vitamin D is your body; your body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to the sun's ultraviolet rays. But getting vitamin D this way may be difficult for some women. People who are 50 and older don't make vitamin D as efficiently as younger people; people who live in northern climates may not get enough sun exposure, particularly during the winter months; people who don't spend time outdoors are unable to make vitamin D. Vitamin D levels also have declined because of widespread sunscreen use. Sunscreen blocks the ultraviolet rays that can damage the skin -- but these same rays cause the body to produce vitamin D.The remedy:Get 10 to 15 minutes of unprotected sun exposure at least two times a week on the face, arms, hands or back, the ODS says. After that time, you should protect yourself with a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Fortified foods are another source of vitamin D, the ODS says. A cup of skim milk provides about 200 IU of vitamin D; the vitamin is also found in eggs, salmon and organ meats. A supplement can supply vitamin D, too. Women should begin taking vitamin D supplements as teens and continue throughout life.Why you need it:Iron is used to help the blood carry oxygen throughout the body. If you don't get enough iron in your diet, you may feel fatigued. Too much iron, however, can be fatal.What you need:18 mg a day for menstruating women; 27 mg a day for pregnant women; 9 mg a day for women who are breastfeeding; and 8 mg day for women after menopause.The problem:Iron deficiency is usually a problem only for women who have not gone through menopause; women mainly lose iron from menstrual bleeding. Iron levels may also fall if you:Iron deficiency develops gradually. Anemia from iron deficiency may be caused by too little iron in the diet, inadequate absorption of iron or excessive blood loss, the ODS says. The type of iron you eat influences how well you absorb iron. Heme iron, which comes from meat, is absorbed efficiently. Nonheme iron, which is found in rice, corn, black beans, soybeans and wheat,  is not absorbed as completely. Absorption of this type of iron also is affected by other foods in the diet.The remedy:You absorb iron best from meat and fish, so adding grilled chicken to a salad is a plus. Non-meat eaters can opt for iron-rich combos. Try kale or beet greens tossed with raisins, nosh on dried apricots and nuts, and lace enriched cereals with blackstrap molasses. To boost absorption, combine iron-rich foods with orange juice and other foods that contain vitamin C. Don't take an iron supplement without a doctor's guidance, because excess iron can harm the heart, liver and other organs.Why you need it:Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin. It helps make red blood cells, prevent birth defects such as neural tube defects and spina bifida, and lower homocysteine levels.What you need:400 micrograms a day; 500 micrograms a day for women who are pregnant; 600 micrograms a day for women who are breastfeeding.No email address was supplied by.

Some environmentalists raise concerns that pollution from the mine will harm the runs and put the long-standing industry and source of subsistence at risk.Cheyette said the visit, just a month after her confirmation, is a signal that she understands the importance of the ongoing debate: "We know that she is doing all that she can to quickly come up to speed and gather as much information as possible, so that's a good thing," he said.Groups on the opposite side of the issue agree it will be good to have McCarthy on the ground."The old saying, seeing is believing and that is certainly the case here; we welcome the opportunity to have her with us," said Mike Heatwole, vice president of Pebble Public Affairs. "This is primarily for her to see for herself."The Pebble Partnership became aware of McCarthy's interest in the project shortly after she was confirmed as administrator last month.  She will be the first cabinet level official to tour the area.McCarthy is expected to meet with local leaders in Iliamna and other communities near the proposed site. She will also visit Portage and Fairbanks while in Alaska to highlight efforts by the Obama administration to fight climate change and its impact on the state.Both sides of the Pebble debate hope to shape McCarthy's views during her visit and that she will take their concerns back to Washington.Contact Adam PinskerCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Take a look at some different types of bait you can use while saltwater or freshwater fishing.Live (or dead) bait:Some anglers claim natural bait is the best choice because fish will recognize the smell. Some types of natural bait include: shrimp, worms and insects.Lures:While lures are artificial bait, they can sometimes move like natural bait and can attract fish. This type of bait can last longer and can require less maintenance than natural bait.Cut bait:Cut bait – or pieces of fish – can attract fish to the scent. This can be effective for attracting saltwater fish, as well as freshwater fish like catfish and carp.No email address was supplied by.

The area was very swampy, Ipsen said.The Air Patrol didn’t have floats for its aircraft, Ipsen said, so pilots from the US Fish and Wildlife Service flew two Piper PA-18 Super Cubs equipped with floats to land near the crash site.The FWS pilots were able to reach the downed pilot and his passengers, who were identified as Terry Wighs, 63, of Fairbanks, Brian Madros, 20, of Kaltag, Fred Huntington, Jr., 27, of Kaltag and Nathan Elswick, 32, of Anvik, respectively.The men were all shuttled to out of the area where they reported having sustained minor injuries and refused medical treatment.According to the troopers report, the men had set off taken off from Anvik en route to Fairbanks to attend a Hazmat Woofer training that starts Tuesday. Wighs had picked up his final passengers in Kaltag and was on his way to refuel his plane in Galena when the engine began to sputter and finally failed.The plane made a hard landing, Ipsen said, in the waters. The men were able to get out of the crashed plane and were able to build a fire to dry off while they waited for crews to arrive.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"We can tell its growth rate and show how many seasons it was out in salt water."While Fish and Game's latest weirs rely on old principles, their construction utilizes new technology. The panels have air in them which allows them to float, a design which makes management of the fish and the water traffic easier."They're on a pivot on a hinge and we can set them with these cables to haul the angle of attack in to the water," Erickson said. "If the water is really flowing we can change it and pop it up and make it flow at a different height."Fish and Game has never collected hands-on data on weir data from these four sites.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

According to ADF&G, the incident happened around 10:30 a.m. and no one was injured."That is a trail we always warn people about," said Fish and Game Assistant Wildlife Biologist David Battle. "There are salmon in the stream right now and it's very dense vegetation so you can't see around you."On Monday, a brown bear charged a man hiking in the Turnagain Trail area, according to ADF&G. The man shot and killed the animal with an assault rifle he was carrying for protection.Chugach State Park said the trail remained closed between McHugh Creek and Rainbow Pass due to the carcass in the area that could attract other bears to feed on it. The trail will likely stay closed until next week.The berry picking season has begun early according to some pickers and it's another hobby that has drawn people off trails and into bear territory. At Alaska Mill and Feed, sales of berry rakes have more than doubled since the same time last year.According to Fish and Game, bears have been less likely to venture into areas populated by humans during a good berry season, but have noted that it's still important to be extra cautious."Be as attentive as you can, pay attention to your surroundings," said Battle. "Yeah, don't wear headphones. Just pay attention to everything around you when you're up there in bear country, which all of Alaska is bear country.”Battle said compared to other years, so far, this year does not seem to have a high number of bear and human interactions.Contact Mallory PeeblesCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That big fish was not only big, it was the biggest: a 97-pound King salmon that to this day remains the world record.Anderson's catch further enhanced the Kenai River's reputation as a world-class sports fishery. People from all over Alaska and other countries came here for a chance at catching a trophy King.Over the past three summers that reputation has been tarnished. The low number of kings returning to spawn in the Kenai has forced the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to impose numerous regulations on sports anglers, including bait restrictions, catch-and-release stipulations and finally this season an outright ban.The uncertainty surrounding the fishery resulted in fewer visitors to places like Soldotna and Kenai. The uncertainty has hurt the economy in those towns.Jim Golden who runs Trustworthy Charters in Soldotna books fishing trips for 18 different fishing guides. He says business is down by almost 60 percent over the past three summers.Next door at Trustworthy Hardware and Fishing, co-owner Scott Miller says about 60 percent of his sales of fishing gear come during the month of July. This season those sales are down 25 percent compared to the same time last year.While business is a worry, Miller and Golden are also concerned about the reputation of the Kenai. They say each season’s set of restrictions means anglers are finding new places to fish. According to Miller, a group of sports fishermen from Germany who came to the Kenai for years recently decided to try their luck in Canada.Miller says there used to be a buzz in town when someone hooked a really big king. The fish was rushed off to be weighed. The newspaper would show up to do a story. The news stations would do stories. He says that's not happening now.Businesses are now focusing more on other species of salmon, like reds and silvers. Golden says they're fun fish to catch, but they don't generate the kind of excitement the mighty king does.No one knows for sure what's causing the low return of Chinooks to the Kenai. There are plenty of theories. Fish biologists are working hard to find a concrete answer.For now, folks like Scott Miller and Jim Golden hope the answers come soon and the luster returns to the Kenai River.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Anchorage police, as well as Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologists, quickly responded after the caller’s cellphone died, but everyone involved was able to safely return.The park encourages anyone walking on Alaska trails to be bear aware and ready to encounter a bear, as well as knowledgeable in bears’ behavior and how to respond to them.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The ship had another round of passengers set to start a seven-day cruise from Seward to Vancouver, British Columbia on Friday. The company announced that it offered guests a variety of options for compensation and/or assistance with alternate travel arrangements or "stay onboard during the repair and enjoy all the onboard experiences they have come to expect from a Celebrity Cruises vacation."According to Seward City Manager Jim Hunt, the community will face an extra strain with the Silver Salmon Derby happening from Aug. 10 to Aug. 18, along with the passengers and crew from the cruise ship. Hunt estimated the community will have an extra 3,700 people in town.Channel 2 News did speak with passengers in Seward. Chris Elliott, traveling from New Mexico, said while the problems were disappointing, his group and Celebrity Millennium are making the best of it. "We planned this trip for two years. It's my first time and all our first time. And so when they made the announcement we were kind of disappointed but the fact is it could be a lot worse." Elliott went on to say "We are living in a luxury liner. We are already here so we might as well make the most of it."Tracey Rose from San Diego was a bit more upset with Celebrity " We're really disappointed because this is our vacation and our son who has never experienced anything like this, so he was so looking forward to it. And they're saying well you're going to get a free cruise out of it, but we're not paying for your airfare or any of the other expenses to get here."Celebrity did offer each passenger a voucher for another cruise, which Elliott and his group used to book the same trip for next year.Channel 2's Ashleigh Ebert contributed to this story.Contact Neil TorquianoCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Wolf said some on the assembly were acting like "Nazis."Assembly President Linda Murphy says she was as guilty as any other member when the rules became lax and bad habits developed as the debate heated up.Along with apologies, assembly members received copies of chapter 13 of Mason's Legislative Manual, an eight-page guide to maintaining decorum during debate.___Information from: (Kenai, Alaska) Peninsula Clarion, http://www.peninsulaclarion.comCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

There was a number of wires down and lying on the ground in the area.”In an email to Channel 2, AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says about 500 homes were affected by the outage, which lasted for at least six hours.“Apparently the GCI lines, which are lower than the power lines, were drooping,” Ipsen wrote. “The truck came down the (hill) and from what the trooper can tell, the top of the bucket hit the GCI lines, which caused the bucket to come up more and grab the power lines.”Ipsen says a total of five power and telephone poles were affected, including one which was snapped in half and two others which were damaged during the incident. No injuries were reported.Workers from the City of Seward responded to restore power to Salmon Creek and Nash roads. Salmon Creek Road was closed for about three and a half hours while troopers and workers were at the scene.GCI spokesperson David Morris says the truck took down communications lines serving about 225 of its customers, with services restored after about four and a half hours. While the company often responds to incidents in which its lines are snagged, Morris says it's very uncommon for them to involve poles being taken down."Obviously, there was some kinetic energy involved," Morris said.A call to the Seward city clerk’s office for comment wasn’t immediately returned Thursday morning.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The definition covers anyone who provides “assistance, for compensation or with the intent to receive compensation, to a person who is sport fishing, to take or attempt to take halibut by accompanying or physically directing the sport fisherman in sport fishing activities during any part of a charter vessel fishing trip.”NOAA Fisheries Service drafted the new classification to bring its federal definition in line with the one used by the State of Alaska. Currently, state guidelines allow for guided charters as well as unguided fishing, with different limitations on catch and daily take for each group.NOAA Fisheries has said the new definition aims to close a “guide-assisted” loophole that allows unguided anglers to receive help from guides working from shore or on a different boat, while still allowing them to enjoy the “generally more liberal” regulations for unguided fishermen.But SEAGO, the Southeast Alaska Guides Association, says the new definition is a solution in search of a problem.“We don’t have a huge issue with this, but we don’t feel like this solves the problem it was intending to,” said SEAGO executive director Heath Hilyard.Hilyard said, of the more than 300 halibut charters in the state, he expected the new definition to impact “may seven or eight” operators.Despite the new classification not having a broad impact, Hilyard said SEAGO still opposes the regulation and said its passing “left the door open to address major issues with the guided and unguided fishing sectors.”The new definition was met with its share of detractors, including written opposition from one such “guide-assisted” operation, Doc Warner’s Alaska Fishing.“The self?guided sport fishing industry is equal in importance to the charter boat industry and should be recognized and treated as such,” wrote Mark C. Warner and Mark H. Warner of Doc Warner’s.They argued the impact the new definition would have on “the population of halibut will not be measurable, but the impacts of the businesses and law enforcement will be overwhelmingly negative.”With negligible gains to be had from enforcing the new definition, the Warners wrote that “the council would be better served addressing the by catch of the commercial fleet, the fairly unregulated and poorly controlled subsistence harvest, and other resource impactful activities.”The council’s meeting continues this week in Seattle. Agenda, documents and more for the February meeting are available online.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The trooper saw Fish and another individual exchanging items, said Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters. The trooper pulled over the driver, who was later identified as Jeremy Joel Fish.“When one person noticed (the trooper), they tried to conceal their actions and quickly walk over to and get in the vehicle,” Peters said. “The traffic stop attempt occurred soon after that."Peters noted the vehicle, a Ford Taurus, had expired registration, and Fish provided the trooper with a false identification card.Moments later, according to troopers, Fish suddenly began speeding away from the traffic stop, leading troopers on a 20-minute pursuit, speeds exceeding 90 miles per hour at times. Troopers report Fish was driving recklessly throughout the course of the pursuit, at times nearly ramming patrol cars as well as endangering the health of his passenger.Eventually Fish led troopers to Boulder Drive in Wasilla where he exited his vehicle and began fleeing on foot.Fish was eventually apprehended when the pursuing trooper used a TASER. Fish was then transported to Mat-Su Pre Trial where he’s being held without bail.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"The East Side setnetters catch the kings whether fishing for reds."The Cook Inlet Fisherman's Fund accused the ADFG of unfairly targetting setnet fishermen for a closure during the 2013 sockeye season while other fishing groups were allowed to fish.Adolf Zeman, an attorney representing the Cook Inlet Fisherman's Fund (CIFF), said his clients believe they were singled out."They feel that they're being singled out in terms of all the user groups. When other groups are out fishing, our folks are sitting on the beach watching," Zeman said.CIFF says its setnetters lost thousands of dollars during closures in 2012.In response, the ADFG told the court that CIFF has not demonstrated that its members will suffer irreparable harm and should not be granted an injunction blocking the department's actions.Jeff Regnart, the Director of Commercial Fisheries for ADFG, said the department will stand by its actions."[Cook Inlet] is one of the more complex fisheries that we deal with as far as salmon in the state of Alaska. That local staff is making decisions daily based on all the available information that comes in and following the various guidelines that the board regulations, meaning the board of fish, which sets the regulations for management of this fishery," Regnart said.The superior court will hold a hearing on the issue next week and will consider all pleadings, filings and testimony before making a decision.Regardless of the outcome, all groups have agreed they want to see the king salmon numbers thrive.Contact Samantha AngaiakCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

While everyone should eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables and lean protein, age, activity levels and lifestyles influence the kinds of foods different people should consume.<COL>iStock/YinYang(NewsUSA) - Common sense says that different people need different diets for optimum health. While everyone should eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables and lean protein, age, activity levels and lifestyles influence the kinds of foods different people should consume. Here are some general tips about eating to boost your health:- For students. Sorry, but you really can't live on just pizza and soda. Long nights and busy schedules mean that you need to eat for optimum academic performance. Salmon, tuna fish, flax seeds and walnuts all contain Omega-3 fatty acids. In studies, Omega-3 fatty acids have been linked with healthier brain function. The night before a test, eat grilled salmon or sushi with miso soup. You will feel alert enough to pass your test the next morning -- provided that you also remembered to study.- For athletes. Unless you're training for the Olympics, you probably don't need to eat an extra pizza every night to recover lost calories. That being said, well-fed muscles recover more quickly after workouts. Athletes should aim to eat a small snack containing both protein and complex carbohydrates within a few hours after their workout. Good choices include peanut butter with whole-grain crackers and fruit with yogurt.- For busy professionals. Extra stress on the job contributes to fatigue, irritability and poorer immune function. Foods like arugula and almonds have immune-system-boosting properties, but busy schedules don't always leave enough time to toss together a healthy salad.If you skip meals or tend to eat on the run, try looking for healthy, 100 percent fruit juices for quick and lasting energy.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

In this week's Fishing Report, Channel 2’s Kari Bustamante takes you to Seward in search of one of Alaska's most favored species of fish.When it comes to silver salmon fishing, Seward is the coho capital.Mid-July marks the start of peak season, so we hop onboard with captain Jimmy Akana of Fish House Charters, heading outside Resurrection Bay."You guys got a pretty basic mooching rig here: 20-pound test (line), real light rig with small mooching weight, and a cut piece of herring,” Akana explains to a group of anglers aboard his boat. “When you go to start fishing take the whole rig, just drop it in the water and we're going to do a 25-second countdown -- metered some fish kinda deep.”According to Akana, we shouldn’t expect instant gratification once we’ve dropped a line.“If you get down there to the desired depth, if you cut your countdown and you don’t get bit, just start winding in real slow like this, just keeping your bait moving.”Akana gives us a heads-up -- hooking a fish isn't the hard part.“Wherever you hook it is likely not where you're going to land it,” Akana said.Within seconds of dropping bait, we've got a double fish-on.“OK, slow down -- nice! -- OK, bring him in,” Akana advised. “You’ve got him right below your feet, slow -- get him over toward me, lift up, lift up…”Between us and the neighboring boats, fish are being netted by the second. A quick half-day trip is enough for all to get a share of the action.“You don't lose this fish!” Akana exclaimed, watching another silver’s final moments of fighting. “Lift up real slow, stand at the rail -- ah!”So if it's silvers you want, Seward is where you should be.Other spots that are hot include the Kenai River for sockeyes. Whittier is ripe with rockfish and lingcod, and if you're up for a little hike, trek up to Symphony Lake for grayling.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That means eating enough food each day and making healthy food choices. However, some research indicates that girls' caloric intake appears low for their activity levels.Female teenage athletes are encouraged to get 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 15 percent from protein and 25 percent from fat. But telling your teen that might not make a difference-- Most teens' nutrition know-how doesn't affect their diet. Many female athletes are afraid to gain weight, so they undereat despite their high activity levels. Parents and coaches can help active teens by encouraging healthy eating.The Weight-control Information Network (WIN) offers these tips to keep teenage athletes healthy:- Pay attention to food choices and serving sizes. Choosing healthy foods in appropriate portions will supply adequate nutrients for teenagers. For example, one healthy food choice for teens is six one-ounce servings of grains every day, like whole-grain cereal.- Provide protein. Protein repairs body tissue and builds muscles. Teens typically need five and a half one-ounce servings a day. Very active teens might need more. Lean meat, beans, tofu, eggs, veggie burgers and nuts and nut butters all provide protein.- Pack some iron in your teen's lunch. Iron replenishes the body, so it's especially important for teen girls. Try eating seafood, lean beef, legumes, spinach and fortified cereals and breads.- Make sure your teen eats healthy fats. A low-fat diet isn't necessarily healthy. Fat is an important nutrient that helps the body grow and develop properly. It also serves as a source of energy, but be aware that some fats are better than others. Instead of saturated and trans fats, aim to provide 25 to 35 percent of her calories in the form of healthy fat. Unsaturated fat can be found in olive, canola, safflower, corn and soybean oils, avocados, salmon, whitefish, trout, tuna and tree nuts, such as almonds and walnuts.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The plane, with six passengers on board, was headed for Brooks Camp in the Katmai National Park and Preserve.“(Petersen) stated that he was taking off up-river and that he never saw the boat,” investigators wrote.The Wisconsin man operating the guide fishing boat, 29-year-old Ted Gibson, told the NTSB that he didn’t see the Cessna until it was about 75 yards away, and already on course to hit his 18.5-foot boat.“The boat operator said that the boat's motor was idling in neutral and that he put it in reverse to try to move the boat out of the path of the airplane,” investigators wrote. “The boat operator said that, as he backed the boat away, the airplane struck the front of it.”The impact knocked Gibson and his two passengers out of the boat, but when he reached the surface he saw them swimming to shore and turned his attention to the plane’s occupants.“The boat operator saw that the airplane was upside down in the water, and he swam toward it to try to help,” investigators wrote. “He said that the pilot already had most of the passengers out of the airplane and that other boats in the area quickly arrived to help get everybody out of the water.”According to troopers, all 10 people on board the two craft safely escaped, with two people from the plane and one from the boat being evaluated at the Naknek Clinic. The NTSB report lists three people with minor injuries from the collision, with board spokesperson Clint Johnson saying their distribution between the craft matched troopers’ description.Investigators based their initial assessment of the damage to the vehicles involved on images taken at the scene.“Pre-recovery photographs of the airplane provided by the Alaska State Troopers and the Federal Aviation Administration showed that the nose of the airplane's left float was crushed aft and upward and an outboard section of the right wing was crushed and partially separated,” investigators wrote. “The front right side of the boat was crushed inward, upward, and aft.”A weather report from the King Salmon airport, four minutes after the crash, listed winds from the northeast at six knots with visibility at 10 miles and broken cloud ceilings at 700 and 1,300 feet.Johnson says investigators are working with the Federal Aviation Administration to determine who might have had right-of-way in the waters near the airport. He says a factual report on the collision will ultimately address both the circumstances under which it occurred and suggestions on how to avoid similar incidents.“That’s what we do -- we come up with ways or recommendations to keep this from happening again,” Johnson said.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The fish were returning to the Crystal Lake Hatchery.Alaska Department of Fish and Game sportfish biologist Doug Fleming said he found the dead fish after last week's warm weather, when temperatures were in the 80s.He suspects a combination of factors led to the die-off, including hot water, low oxygen levels in the water and a large number of fish trapped at Blind Slough.Fleming says they were expecting 1,800 adult kings to return this year. Officials will have a better estimate later this year of how many survived.No email address was supplied by.

Last week, the Trustees for Alaska's petition to put lands of the Chuitna watershed off limits to mining was rejected by the Dept. of Natural Resources."It's important for people to understand that this isn't a decision to let this mine go forward this is a decision to not preemptively ban mining," DNR Deputy Commissioner Ed Fogels said.Fogels says Trustees for Alaska, who sent in the petition on behalf of the Chuitna Citzens Coalition and the Cook Inletkeeper, had the burden of proof. It had to show the DNR that it was impossible for Chuitna's salmon streams to be reclaimed after the mining operation was finished."There's no technology that has been demonstrated anywhere where you can dig through a salmon stream at 350 feet and put that salmon stream back in place," Cook Inletkeeper executive director Bob Shavelson said.Fogels admits that could be the case but needs to review more information in order to make any sort of final decision."What we want to do is let the rest of the process go forward," Fogels said. "We want the full environmental analysis to evaluate the detailed proposal by the company to make that determination whether it's possible or not possible."One of the main beneficiaries of the process moving forward is the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority who owns the potential Chuitna mining land's surface and subsurfaces. PacRim Coal has some of the mining applications required already sitting on the DNR's desk. If the company is awarded the numerous permits required to start mining, the Trust Authority would get royalties for any coal produced and for any PacRim land surface leases."The revenue could be substantial," Trust Land Office executive director Greg Jones said. "In their own application, PacRim coal has indicated it could be in excess of $250 million worth of royalties to the trust."Jones sole job is to raise money for the Trust Authority to spend on programs it believes will benefit one in ten Alaskans.The DNR says PacRim's application will take about a year to review and then it will take about two years for the mine to be built if it's approved.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

In Jackson Hole, Wyoming, one of those signs of spring is bison returning to the golf course.This year, bison started showing up on the course at Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis in mid-May, Jeff Jensen, the course's assistant superintendent, told theJackson Hole News and Guide. They'll usually see only a few bison on the course, but this year they've seen up to three dozen over the course of a day or two.It's not too surprising that bison wander onto the golf course, considering it's near Grand Teton National Park and the National Elk Refuge. Course staff do their best to get bison out of the way, since they can get in the way of the golfers and damage greens. When the bison get to be too much of an issue, the golf course asks the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to help.But ultimately, "wildlife has the right-of-way," Jensen told the Jackson Hole paper.No email address was supplied by.

Biologists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game were conducting escapement surveys, but had trouble counting the king salmon due to the creek's high levels and murky waters.Bruce Bombassaro of The Bait Shack says anglers were ecstatic to have their local fishing spot back."They (the anglers) are excited, they're real excited," Bombassaro said. "A chance to come back out here, it's close to downtown, so it's just having that convenience of having somewhere nearby to go fish, it's nice having them back down here fishing."According to Bombassaro, the silver salmon season begins to taper in late August to early September.Contact Jessica Ridgway(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

On Sunday, the Alaska Aviation Museum honored the centennial with a celebration."Aviation is more important to our state more than any other state because we have hardly any roads," Shari Hart, with the Alaska Aviation Museum, said. "To be able to see them fly I think causes a kind of excitement in every single soul."Hundreds of people came to enjoy the museum's salmon bake fundraiser but everyone came for the scheduled fly-bys from the pioneering planes that paved the airwaves for generations of aviation.The museum says its crown jewel is a 1931 Fairchild Pilgrim, which is a ten-passenger airliner, believed to be one of the first airplanes with a restroom. The plane arrived in state in 1935 and worked commercially for nearly 50 years. The museum has spent thousands of dollars on restoring the plane and it was flown for the first time in nearly three decades this Spring."It's just amazing how much aviation connects the villages and how connected the villagers are to aviation," Chuck Miller, Vice President with Alaska Aviation Museum, said. "We need to inspire another hundred years of aviation because we're not building roads, we're building airports."Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

He may have the coolest job in town. Burton, a former lawyer, became a brewer several years ago.“I’m finally getting my soul back,” Burton joked.Burton gave me a tour of the basement at BrewHouse where they keep the kegs and also gave me a rundown on how to make pumpkin beer.“It’s pumpkin pie in a glass,” Burton said.Burton uses 180 lbs. of pureed pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander and honey to make the seasonal beer, which is 10.3% alcohol.It’s $6.50 for a 13 oz. snifter.It’s being sold now, and is available until supplies run out, which is usually around Thanksgiving.Also, keep an eye out for a limited salmon berry beer at Glacier BrewHouse. Burton told me he recently bought berries from Shishmaref, those will be used in a new beer.Midnight Sun Brewing Co. has two types of pumpkin beers.One is called T.R.E.A.T., it’s an imperial chocolate pumpkin porter. The other beer is Trickster, which is a Belgian-style pumpkin ale.Beer ambassador Darcy Kniefel at Midnight Sun says T.R.E.A.T is sweet porter that uses 50 lbs. of pumpkin and some coco.Trickster, Kniefel says, is a bit lighter but still has a sweet flavor with pumpkin pie spices that hit you at the end of your sip.All of them taste like fall to me.I can’t wait to see what Burton and Kniefel’s plans are for the Christmas beers.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"We've got about 300 kings there [as of Tuesday]”.Last fall’s windstorms also hampered surveys due to the debris by fallen trees."Between Reeve Blvd and the dam up at Elmendorf it put down over 100 trees in the creek and during the high water, that made it quite dangerous,” Bosch said.The wait for good conditions to count the fish has proven to be worth it.ADF&G counted 468 fish on Tuesday and 288 will be for the brood stock at William Jack Hernandez Sport Fishery. With the fish count looking healthy, the state says it can also boost the city’s economy."People won't have to go down to the Kenai to try to fish down there and they won't have to go to the Susitna River or Willow or places like that because the more fish we can provide here they can come here and fish for them," Bosch said. "Ship Creek provides an annual average of about $7.2 million a year back to the economy of Anchorage."Contact: Samantha Angaiak(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

In this week's Fishing Report, Channel 2’s Kari Bustamante heads to a popular fishing destination that continues to prove fruitful -- despite a recent run of bad luck.The flood of 2012 nearly redesigned the streams in Willow, according to Mike Coughlin with Susitna Valley River Guides.“We had about three weeks of rain last fall and this river flooded – boy, for about two weeks it was really, really high,” Coughlin said. “The river is completely different now.”Coughlin takes time to help us rediscover one of the most productive rainbow trout fishing spots. He’s got us swinging a smolt pattern of his own design.“We call it a Marty Feldman because of the big eyes; that’s just rabbit fur, with lead eyes and a bead for an attractor just slid on,” Coughlin said. “It’s pretty effective -- it’s pretty much all we use in the spring.”Me, I’m pretty much sold.“Go ahead and just keep bringing him right to ya,” Coughlin says as I reel in a fish.We try a few casts without the Feldman, but the kings harass the line -- and my forearm.“Anyone wanna take turns doing this?” I ask as the day wears on.Despite the presence of rainbows, we abandon hole, hoping to pick one up on the drift back.“Left a couple kings with sore mouths -- they left me with sore fingers,” I remark as the boat moves on.As our catch piles up later in the day, I’m reminded of that saying: “the more, the merrier.”“I’m losing count!” I exclaim, lifting another fish from the water.Place Willow Creek on the list of hot spots after this week’s Fishing Report. Just remember to pack extra flies, because getting hung up in the structure is a possibility.Seward is a haven for silver salmon, the reds are in the Kenai River, and if it’s halibut you crave Homer is where you ought to be.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The plane struck a guide fishing boat with three people aboard, operated by 29-year-old Ted Gibson of Wisconsin.“During the collision, the three occupants of the guide boat were thrown from the vessel and into the river,” troopers wrote. “The Cessna 207 then flipped upside down in the river with seven people on board.”Troopers say several other fishing boats approached to help the vehicles’ occupants, all of whom safely escaped. Two people from the plane and one person from the boat were evaluated at the Naknek Clinic for what appeared to be minor injuries.According to National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Clint Johnson, the aircraft -- flown by Katmai Air and had been retrofitted with a turbine engine -- had been en route to Brooks Camp, in the Katmai National Park and Preserve. Investigators are attempting to recover the aircraft from the river Monday morning.“The airplane flipped over and partially sank – it’s being held up by the floats right now,” Johnson said.Johnson says there’s no shared radio channel for marine and aviation traffic, and that the collision occurred near the local airport.“Obviously there’s boat traffic as well as arriving and departing plane traffic,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to figure out what happened.”AST spokesperson Megan Peters says waterways play an important role in remote areas of the state, one which sometimes leads them to host a variety of vehicles.“In rural Alaska, rivers are transportation -- that’s like our highways,” Peters said.While roads have clear warning lines and signs, Peters says that like off-road trails, rivers are unmarked -- a factor that leads to crashes like Sunday’s.“I couldn’t tell you who has the right-of-way,” Peters said. “You see people have boat collisions where people go around the corner and don’t see each other.”Peters says the absence of serious injuries or fatalities from the collision was extremely fortunate.“It’s awesome, the fact that everyone either walked or swam away,” Peters said.The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as troopers, are investigating the collision.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It went a little something like this: Man enters witch's cave (apologies for the obvious metaphor, but blame the filmmakers for that one). Witch speaks of man's destiny. Man and witch have hot, barbarian sex. Witch tries to kill man. Man throws witch into fire. Witch is no more.This no-frills cinematic sex gem is enough to make even a bad boy blush, but wait until you peek at our top five picks for the steamiest movie scenes ever.We have compiled the hottest, most intriguing love scenes for your contemplation. If you are wondering what the criteria are for selecting a top five for steamy love scenes it is this: if it makes us hot, it's considered. If people cannot seem to quit talking about it years later AND it makes us hot ... voila -- it makes the list.It's a dirty job, but someone had to select the top five. Here are ours ...No. 5: "Bound" - Gina Gershon and Jennifer TillyIn the movie "Bound," Gina Gershon plays Corky, a newly paroled ex-convict who tries to earn her keep on the outside by doing maintenance for an apartment building.In the hallways she meets Violet -- played by Jennifer Tilly -- and her live-in mobster boyfriend. After the boyfriend leaves, Violet coyly begs Corky to retrieve something from her drain (like that line's never been used before).After Corky finishes, Violet admits it was all a ruse to get closer to Corky and tries to seduce her. The seduction happens pretty early in the movie and leaves audiences begging for more. Violet eventually screws over her sleazy boyfriend, but not before she and Corky have a sexy go at it first.Spontaneous lesbian sex is steamy, but dominance and submission is where it's at, as our next selection shows us ...No. 4: "Secretary" - James Spader and Maggie GyllenhaalThe hot love in "Secretary" revolves around the sadomasochistic relationship that develops between a newly hired secretary and her boss.The boss-man (James Spader) realizes that the secretary (Maggie Gyllenhaal) was once in the insane asylum for doing harm to herself and orders her never to do it again. We soon come to realize however, that he is actually turned on by her submissive manner -- as is she by his dominant one.Some feel the famous spanking scene in the boss's office is the hottest of all, but the final love scene where they engage in S&M/wedding-night-type sex is too good to be counted out.Rather than depicting commitment as a turn-off in this film, this once-taboo choice is shown as an acceptable lifestyle and it leaves us hungering for more.S&M is hot, but cheating is rapturous, as our next two steamy actors display ...No. 3: "Unfaithful" - Diane Lane and Oliver MartinezConnie Sumner's (Diane Lane) life appears to be perfect for all intents and purposes while married to her adoring husband played by Richard Gere in the movie "Unfaithful."Her world turns upside down, however, after she happens upon a hot Frenchman who offers to "help" her after she f injures her knees during a minor fall. Initially she rejects his advances, but eventually finds an excuse to visit him again, and a torrid extra-marital affair ensues.The two have passionate first-time-cheating sex, and the Frenchman asks her to slap him around a little. They later outdo themselves and heat up the screen in a quite memorable scene in the hallway of his apartment building after she tries to end it. It does not end well, but the sex is undeniably terrific.And though the cheating is blissfully steamy, savage sex is forbidden and undeniable, as we'll see next ...No email address was supplied by.

Usually, the condition is chronic and cannot be cured. Instead, treatment for dry eyes focuses on relieving symptoms.To maintain eye comfort and good vision, the front surface of your eye needs to be covered with an even layer of tears that contain the right mix of water and oils. If tears are not of sufficient quantity or quality to maintain that layer, dry eye disease (also called ocular surface disease) can develop.Symptoms of dry eye disease may include a stinging, itchy or burning sensation in your eye, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and mucus in or around your eye. As you've experienced, excess tearing can also be a symptom. Normally, tears are produced very slowly. But if that process fails to make enough tears, a different tear production system may be activated. And, unfortunately, this reflex mechanism usually produces too many tears.Before you begin treatment for dry eyes, review your current medications and medical history with your doctor. Some drugs — such as high blood pressure medications, antihistamines, acne medications and decongestants -- can cause dry eyes. If medication is causing the problem, a change in prescription may be all you need to relieve symptoms.Certain medical conditions can decrease tear production. These include rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes and lupus, among others. In some cases, systemic treatment for these conditions may ease dry eyes.Smoking has also been associated with an increased risk of dry eye disease. Not only is the particulate matter that is released into the air irritating to the surface of the eye, other toxins in tobacco smoke actually alter the quality of tears produced by the eye.If switching medication or treating an underlying medical condition isn't the issue or doesn't give you enough relief, a number of treatments are available. For dry eyes caused by a lack of tears, the first therapy is over-the-counter artificial tear eyedrops. For many people, eyedrops, used about four to six times a day, are enough eye lubricant to relieve dry eye symptoms.If artificial tears don't provide enough relief, the next step may be punctual plugs. These tiny silicone stoppers are inserted into tear duct openings, blocking the eye's drainage channel so more tears stay on the surface of the eye. The plugs can be removed if having them in place makes the eyes water too much.Prescription cyclosporine eyedrops (Restasis) can increase the amount of tear production. However, some people with underlying medical conditions may not be able to use cyclosporine because it suppresses the body's immune system.If none of these therapies are sufficient, additional remedies -- such as moisture-chamber glasses, special contact lenses or permanent tear duct closure -- are possible options. Rarely, eye surgery may be necessary for severe cases of dry eye disease that don't respond to any of these treatments.If the source of dry eye disease is eye oil glands that aren't working properly -- rather than insufficient tears -- treatment is different. When these glands don't produce the right amount or consistency of oil, tears can become thick and sticky. Using warm compresses over closed eyelids for three to five minutes once or twice a day, followed by a gentle lid massage, can help melt the oil in the glands and move it to the eye's surface.Antibiotics may also be useful for reducing inflammation in the glands that can lead to oil production problems. In addition, some evidence indicates that dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids (flaxseed oil, fish oil) can improve the quality of tear oil.Work with your eye care provider to find the appropriate dry eye treatment. For most people, dry eye disease is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment. These therapies won't cure dry eyes, but they should help reduce symptoms enough so that you can be comfortable and function normally in your daily activities.—Muriel Schornack, O.D., Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.Source:http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/treatment-for-dry-eyes-focuses-on-relieving-symptomsNo email address was supplied by.

Gov. Mead Treadwell.At issue is whether Alaska voters should be allowed to prohibit the use of shore gill nets and set nets for fishing in nonsubsistence areas of the state, as a proposed ballot initiative would have done.Treadwell said in a statement that he followed the advice of the Department of Law, which described the initiative as a possible violation the Alaska Constitution.“On this initiative we received input from the sponsor, supporters, and opponents, all of which we shared with the attorney general’s office,” Treadwell said. “We have urged the parties to work together with the Board of Fish to address concerns about setnets and fisheries allocations.”Please watch Channel 2 News and check KTUU.com for updates to this developing story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"Therefore, the areas closed to fishing must remain closed until further notice."A Good Samaritan vessel rescued the Lone Star’s four crewmen, but some 13,750 gallons of diesel fuel and 300 gallons of other petroleum products were aboard at the time. Cleanup crews have since estimated that about 1.5 gallons of fuel per day were leaking from the Lone Star.DEC officials determined that the sinking had contaminated an estimated 27,109 pounds of fish harvested by area setnetters, which were gathered by another fishing tender and disposed of 12 miles from shore. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game issued an emergency order Friday closing the Igushik River to salmon fishing.Steve Russell, DEC’s on-scene coordinator, says dive teams have been able to plug seven holes leading to the Lone Star’s fuel tanks, as well as the 4-inch-by-5-inch triangular hole where the transducer was torn off.“There’s been no sheen around the vessel since early yesterday,” Russell said.The apparent progress led Fish and Game to schedule Wednesday's overflight of the area, in order to decide whether to lift its emergency order. According to Tim Sands, Fish and Game’s area management biologist for western Bristol Bay, the flight was delayed Wednesday due to fog.Russell says more ships are en route to lighter fuel from the Lone Star, and are scheduled to arrive in the next few days.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Learning subsistence living is what helps Jewline Hoseth and her family connect with their rich culture of growing up in Dillingham, Alaska.“Everyone has a job,” Hoseth said, who learned subsistence from her grandma.“It’s a real honor to have her teach us how to do fish the way she’s been doing fish for all the years that she has been,” said Hoseth’s sister, Gayla Woods.“We’re a big family, there are 8 of us kids and all of us have had the opportunity to learn from our gram,” said Woods.And like any commitment, preparing fish can be a full-time job.“If it’s raining, you’re going to want to smoke your fish constantly. You’re pretty much married to your smoke house,” Hoseth said.It’s the town’s strong history of fishing that helps the community thrive today. Now the largest city in the Bristol Bay region, Dillingham wasn’t always the largest settlement.In 1818 across the river from town, the community now known as Nushagak was the center of trade when Russians built a fur trading post.Originally inhabited by the Yupik people, local native groups and natives from all over the state plus outside traders mixed together as they came to visit or live at the post.In 1884, the first salmon cannery in the Bristol Bay region was constructed, and within 20 years, 10 more canneries opened in the region.But by the turn of the century, the dawn of Nushagak’s day was rapidly setting.Nushagak, once the hustle-and-bustle of the bay area, received a fatal strike. When the channel of the Nushagak River began to shift, so did the people. That’s when the town of Dillingham began to grow.In addition to the growing mudflats that limited access to fishing vessels, the world-wideinfluenza pandemicof 1918 devastated the region and contributed to the depopulation of Nushagak.After the epidemic left no more than 500 survivors around the region, a hospital and orphanage were established in Kanakanak, across the river from Nushagak and near the present day city of Dillingham.That’s when Dillingham became the fishing town that thrives today.“We’ve always been about fishing here,” said Dillingham Mayor Alice Ruby. “Over time, we’ve just went from a primarily subsistence site to a really commercial fishery now with subsistence.”Today, one of the only canneries left in Dillingham is Peter Pan Seafoods, and it remains one of America’s best-known names in wild Alaska seafood products.“The fishing industry is critical for our economy,” Ruby said. “The Peter Pan Cannery is the oldest facility in this district and it still operates today and it’s over 100-years-old. In fact, it’s kind of one of our historic areas.”Thanks to the rich fisheries of Bristol Bay, Dillingham is the fastest growing community in the region.It supports more than 200 commercial fishing licenses and has four fish processing plants. In the summer, workers at the fishing plants double the city’s population.Today, the Alaska Salmon Fishery is one of the only certified sustainable wild salmon fisheries left in the world. And Dillingham is an important port to the Bristol Bay Fishery, which annually provides most of the total Alaska salmon value overall.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

In this week's Fishing Report, Channel 2’s Kari Bustamante showcases one such project here in Alaska.The wounds of war cut deeper than skin. Months of surgery and medication don't always heal the mind, but Camp Patriot offers respite to those who have served and sacrificed."Our mission is to take United States disabled veterans on outdoor adventures and through those adventures, what we are able to do is show them a paradigm shift -- show them they have abilities, not just disabilities, to press on with life," said Micah Clark, Camp Patriot’s founder and executive director.With the assistance of local business Army/Navy, Camp Patriot brings living heroes to our state for a weekend of outdoor adventures, centered around our statewide pastime."I think if you had an iconic version of what is Alaska, I think it's jumping into a turboprop and flying out to a big lake, coming into a stream the salmon are running," Clark said.“I've never fished with a fly pole before,” said wounded warrior Ike Zahn. “It took about all morning before I got the hang of it, but after I finally got the hang of it, it was great -- we all caught a couple fish.”After a few days in Southcentral, the crew has pinpointed the pattern for success.“This is the first day where it's actually been beautiful and no rain on us, but today we didn't catch any fish and the other two days we did,” Zahn said. “So if it would have been another rainy day, I'd have been happy with that -- as long as we were catching fish.”But the best catch can't be found in the water.“Every trip we do, we create relationships with these guys,” Clark said. “And that's probably the most critical thing, just taking them on a trip, was just kind of that shift or that light at the end of the tunnel that said, ‘Hey, there is something worth living for -- so quit going down this path, and look at these other opportunities.’”An opportunity to mend is what Camp Patriot strives to achieve, using a sport in which Alaska thrives.As for this week's hot spots, warm weather is helping Willow Creek, where a bunch of trout are being picked up -- but remember, no fishing below the Parks Highway bridge.Also, try the lakes in the Mat-Su Valley for trout.Silvers in Seward are an option, and even further south Homer has been hot for halibut and lingcod.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The affected area covers waters from Fish and Game regulatory markers about 300 yards downstream of Slikok Creek’s mouth to Skilak Lake.“As of July 12, inseason information, including data from inriver assessment programs as well as king salmon catch data in the Cook Inlet Central District Upper Subdistrict set gillnet fishery, indicates that the Kenai River late-run is also experiencing low run strength,” Fish and Game officials wrote.On the Ninilchik River, which had been closed to all sport fishing, kings may not be taken for the remainder of the season through Oct. 31. Other species may be caught on the river beginning Tuesday.“Recent poor king salmon runs in Lower Cook Inlet streams, uncertainty over how quickly the runs may rebound, and early indicators of run strength in the Ninilchik River justify continuing the current closure through the remainder of the season in order to achieve the Ninilchik River escapement and egg-take goals,” Fish and Game officials wrote.Biologists at Fish and Game also say that kings may not be targeted on Anchor River, Deep Creek or Stariski Creek after their Tuesday openings to sport fishing. Anglers must immediately release kings caught while fishing for other species, without removing them from the water.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

But those now familiar man-made noises are almost a century in the making. Government Hill, the neighborhood there, is almost as old.Before President Woodrow Wilson's administration made Anchorage the connecting hub for a stretch of railroad, the most prominent dot on western maps of the Alaska Territory was Campbell Point. In 1915, construction of a railroad that eventually would link Seward and Whittier to the coal-rich fields of the Matanuska Valley and the state's expansive interior began.Hoards of job seekers arrived on boats and set up tents on the flats, and so burgeoned a tent city. One could stay alive there, but there was not exactly a high quality of life. To attract and keep people working in the newly-founded Anchorage, the Alaska Railroad, backed by the federal government, decided to build cottages on the hill.Anchorage, which draws its name because boats decided to drop anchor here, has a name about as original as Government Hill, which would not exist in its current form if not for the government throwing cash at the hill nearest the tent city.That's the story as told by historian Bruce Merrell, who spent much of his career with the Anchorage Public Library System.According to Merrell, the importance of the railroad to the city's growth could not be overstated."If you look at the earliest phone directories for Anchorage, perhaps a quarter or even a third of the people who lived in Anchorage worked for the railroad," he said.So when construction ended in 1923, things puttered along until the threat of a land invasion by Imperial Japan became apparent. The military ramped up investment in the area, including the construction of Elmendorf Army Air Base, which gave Government Hill its modern borders.That's about the time Weaver Franklin arrived. In 1946, the western Nebraska native bought a lot on Government Hill."I was out in the Aleutian Islands for quite a while," the 90-year-old historian said, standing outside his home, wearing his Alaska Railroad cap.“I passed through Anchorage and liked what I seen. That was a long string of bars. It was a good place for a young fellow to have fun, and so I came back," Merrell said.In the early days, he lived in a Quonset hut, a simple steel building sold off as surplus by the military. Similar structures lined Harvard Avenue and the streets nearby.Even when he got too old for the bars, he stayed around and raised a family. He worked on the railroad for the better part of four decades, eventually becoming a locomotive engineer, then to management of the operations. All the while he remained in the neighborhood."It was fun; it was a great adventure," Merrell said.Virginia Borrego, standing along the fence that separates her yard from Franklin's, waved a picture of the steel abode she once called home."They were all like this," Borrego said. "And they were nice."Whenever there are talks of the neighborhood's history, invariably they shift to the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake. On Government Hill, the elementary school split down the middle; half of the building dropped 20 feet, and the playground fell 35 feet.According to a report, the problem was that gravel had been pulled from the foot of the hill during railroad expansions. Because school was out, no one was hurt. No one on Government Hill died."How lucky we were that the kids weren’t in that school," Franklin said. "It would've killed half of them.""Everything was just like it was, it just sank," said Borrego, who was a teacher at the school. She remembers leaving her shoes in the building earlier that day and going back to get them from her classroom.Even today, where the school was once located, now the site of Sunset Park, there is still rusted rebar and gravelly concrete jutting out of the ground where the school was once located. A new school was built a few blocks away, back from the bluff, right next to the base.Another topic that often comes up is the neighborhood's future. A potential bridge across the Knik Arm may someday end up in Government Hill; cuts to the military budget and ongoing talks of base consolidation could affect the people who live there. But the place has changed before. Long before trains and soldiers and bridges showed up, the salmon-rich creeks below were fished and the hills above camped."Every time I think about doing something, I look at this and think forget it," Borrego said to her longtime neighbor."It was good to you," he said. "Government Hill was good to you, and to me. I feel it's been good to us."(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Everyone on board was rescued, but the vessel capsized and sank approximately 18-feet deep.Officials say the Lone Star was carrying large amounts of fuel and more than 35,000 pounds of fish when it sank. In response to this overturned vessel, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game closed a nearby salmon fishery. The emergency order is still in effect."Just yesterday morning they spotted a sheen," said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Shawn Eggert. "At this time the fishery is still closed and the fish and game department's position is they don't want to risk opening the fishery until they know the pollution has dissipated."According to USCG officials, contractors on scene have been able to close all vents and patch the hull of the Lone Star. They will begin to transfer fuel that is still on board later this week.There is no set timeline on how long this process will take or when the fishery will reopen.Contact Jessica Ridgway(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

His truck was found near the river, about four miles out of town.Initial search efforts for Okleasik Thursday included two searchers in a Robinson R-44 helicopter chartered from Bering Air, a small boat fitted with an underwater camera for open-water searches, and four snowmachiner teams.“Then, starting at (3 p.m.), 32 people walked downstream on the banks of the river, looking for Okleasik,” troopers wrote. “A total of about 70 people were involved in the search for Okleasik.”Searchers subsequently found Okleasik, who was declared dead at the scene.“At (5 p.m.), Nome Search and Rescue volunteers located Okleasik's body partially submerged in water a short distance from his vehicle,” troopers wrote.AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says Okleasik was alone when he went fishing. Family members reported him overdue after finding footprints from his truck to the river that suddenly ended.“(Okleasik) was an avid outdoorsman and he would often go fishing by himself, but he would always return by 3 p.m.,” Ipsen said. “He was pretty savvy as far as being outdoors-aware -- he even had an ice stick with him.”Ipsen says the stick, which is used to both probe ice ahead of a person for weakness and support the user while climbing out of collapsed ice, was located near a concealed hole in the river’s frozen surface.“We believe he fell through the ice -- he hit that weak spot,” Ipsen said. “The (ice stick) was found lodged in the ice a short ways away.”The state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage will conduct an autopsy on Okleasik’s body. No foul play is suspected in his death.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

At least 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel were spilled, but only one of the three overflights detected fuel sheens Wednesday .A tug which was holed beneath its waterline on the Nushagak River near Dillingham early Wednesday has spilled at least 5,000 gallons of fuel, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.A DEC statement Wednesday night says the tug Devon was being used for barging at the time of the incident, just after 12:30 a.m. about 10 miles east of Dillingham. DEC officials were informed of the incident by the U.S. Coast Guard at about 4:15 a.m., with tug owner Sam Barging saying the spill had discharged between 5,000 and 5,500 gallons of diesel. The statement listed no reports of injuries."The 7,400-gallon capacity fuel tank was breached when the vessel encountered an unknown submerged object in the river," DEC officials wrote. "Remaining fuel in the tank was transferred into a void space in the vessel."Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 1st Class Shawn Eggert says no injuries were reported in the incident."At about 1 a.m., the ship's master contacted the Anchorage Sector command center to report that he struck what he believed to be a rock and was leaking fuel," Eggert said. "It wasn't an object they were aware of; it wasn't anything they knew was in that part of the river."Eggert says not all of the fuel is expected to remain in the river."Obviously the diesel will burn off when the weather gets a little warmer, but we made a few overflights to track any pollution," Eggert said.According to DEC, a Coast Guard C-130 made an early-morning overflight of the river and spotted an oil sheen, with subsequent flights made by aircraft with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska State Troopers."The Coast Guard observed light sheen on the river during their overflight," DEC officials wrote. "By the time ADF&G and the Alaska State Troopers conducted their overflights, the sheen was no longer visible along the river."Coast Guard officials asked a local radio station to broadcast information about the incident to local fishermen, with future Coast Guard advisory broadcasts set to warn fishermen of the grounding potential in the area.Plans are being made to remove the Devon from the water and conduct a full damage assessment.Channel 2 hasn't received a response to a message left Wednesday evening with Gay Harpole, the DEC's designated contact for information on the spill.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Fishing will be prohibited downstream of the Chugach Power Plant dam.The Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game made the announcement Friday morning and said “king salmon runs throughout most of south central Alaska have been in a period of low productivity.”ADF&G says it has been unable to conduct escapement surveys along the creek due to flood water conditions and only a few adult king salmon have been seen at the William Jack Hernandez hatchery.The hatchery has collected brood stock from king salmon returning to the Ship Creek drainage and stated that “750 adult king salmon are required to meet the brood needs of these stocking programs.”  By the last week in June, 40 percent of the king salmon run has escaped the fishery in past years, according to ADF&G.“A cautious approach is warranted to ensure meeting the 2013 Ship Creek brood goal,” ADF&G wrote in the news release.The emergency order will take effect Sunday, June 30 and Ship Creek will reopen Sunday, July 14.Contact Neil Torquiano(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Congressman Don Young filed his re-election paperwork Tuesday afternoon in Anchorage, seeking his 22nd term.Two other candidates have also filed to run in the 2014 election, so far Democrat Matt Moore and Republican John R. Cox have made their intentions clear.Rep. Young spent Monday with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, touring Western Alaska and spent some time fishing for king salmon. Rep. Boehner will reportedly attend an Anchorage fundraiser Tuesday evening.About eight people with the Coastal Villages Region Fund stood outside the Alaska Division of Elections office after Rep. Young filed for re-election. The group wore t-shirts with bold letters on front that read “Just Fix CDQ,” intending to get a few words in with the longtime congressman.“I wanted to send a message to him and it’s time to fix the allocations,” Florence Nukusuk, Protestor with Coastal Villages Region Fund, said. “Economically, our region in the Yukon – Kuskokwim Delta is structurally poor.”Alaska’s lone U.S. House member has been in office since 1973.“I still enjoy what I do and there will be some day that somebody will challenge me and possibly be successful and the good Lord will take care of me or one or the other,” Rep.

Erkeneff points to a downturn in the economy, but particularly a downturn in king salmon numbers.“When you add it all up, you look at what's happened since the peak years a couple years back, three years back -- we're down a good 25 percent,” Erkeneff said, adding that his bookings are down 65 percent for May and June.Erkeneff isn't alone. Sport fishing guides say they're having trouble filling boats where a few years ago they were turning people away. Real estate agents say the number of riverfront properties for sale isn't increasing, but prices are declining.Kenai's mayor, Pat Porter, says she sees the effects a changing fishery is having on the community as a whole.“The restaurants, the businesses that you have in town, if our people who live here locally aren't receiving the revenue that they normally do, they're going to spend less money throughout the year,” Porter said.For the second year, the river has been closed to subsistence fishing as both state and federal officials track falling king salmon returns.“We're well past the halfway point and it does not look like we're going to meet the escapement goal this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has many eyes on the river, including sonar systems. The minimum escapement goal on the Kenai is 5,300 fish, but so far sonar counters have picked up just over 2,000. Despite having fewer spawning fish, biologists say the fish can recover.“The good thing about king salmon is that they do have what we call overlapping generations, so several years of spawning fish contribute to any single return,” said Robert Begich, a sport fish biologist with Fish and Game.If the biologists' predictions come true, another year of fishing restrictions may mean survival -- for kings and businesses alike.Contact Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Channel 2’s Kari Bustamante again takes that path in this week's Fishing Report.Right upstream of the rush for reds, the Upper Kenai River is a serene scene -- but it’s also home to some of Alaska’s best trout fishing.We connected with guide Alex Carey of Drifters Lodge in pursuit of river rainbows.“So we’re using a flesh pattern today -- basically we’re imitating a little piece of salmon flesh,” Carey said. “Just a little piece of yarn, orange and white works pretty good at this time of the year. A lot of guys call it a firecracker, some people call it steak and eggs; I call it a little flesh fly.”After a first few drifts, we've yet to get a taker."We’re trying to do -- we’re trying to maintain what we call a drag-free drift,” Carey said. “We’re trying to float that little piece of meat imitation in front of the fish’s face for as long as possible in hopes to get a strike out of him. When he strikes it, you give it a nice little pop and set the hook.”But a little change makes for a tremendous turnaround.“There it is, there it is -- nice!” Carey exclaimed as we reeled in our first catch of the day. “Just like that, perfect; that's a nice little rainbow.”With the bite on, photojournalist Rick Schleyer gets his line in the action."Reel-reel-reel-reel-reel,” Carey advised Schleyer, maneuvering in with a net to pull his catch out of the water. “Now stop lift your rod, keep it nice and high for me, bud -- nice little Dolly!”But we hold off until the end to get our hooks in a real catch -- which turns out to be more of a minnow.“Oh, there it is!” Carey said, watching our fish come to the surface. “He's a little one!”With a solid day’s catch, we release and reel in -- no spoils to take home, just a victorious feeling at the finish.Try the Upper Kenai for rainbow trout and Dolly Varden -- the middle of the river is also fishing well.For rainbows up north, Montana Creek is worth a look.While you're there, Nancy Lake can make for an eventful day of pike fishing.In Whittier it’s lingcod season, and you’ll also find rockfish and halibut a-plenty.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The revamp would also allow more room for businesses, hotels, and restaurants, along with a pedestrian-friendly area with bridge walkways."Competition is good because that makes everyone step up," Patrick Hoogerhyde, co-owner of The Bridge, a restaurant located at Ship Creek, said.The Bridge was built in 2005 and lasted until 2008 before entering restaurant limbo. Hoogerhyde took over the restaurant in 2011 with business partner and chef Al Levinsohn. From May to September, the restaurant has opened up seasonally."We follow the salmon season, our whole goal is to promote Alaskan products," Hoogerhyde said.Overall, Hoogerhyde says it's wise for the city to develop the area to go beyond its gravel base.Mayor Dan Sullivan says it's time for Anchorage to catch up with other big cities."We're one of the few cities that I know of in the world that has a waterfront on the Pacific Ocean that is as underdeveloped as Anchorage is," Sullivan said.The company Kling Stubbins' project manager for the master plan, Michael Stevenson says Anchorage has a lot of potential to utilize its unique location."It'll give people direct access to the water, both Cook Inlet and Ship Creek, it'll create a new urban  neighborhood for Anchorage where people can live and work,” Stevenson said. “We have all the trails connected right through the center of it, so we think it's a very exciting plan that'll provide a lot of opportunities for residents of Anchorage.”The master plan for Ship Creek will be unveiled Wednesday (July 10) from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Anchorage Museum Auditorium.Contact: Samantha Angaiak(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

He’s a chef at the Millennium Alaskan Hotel, and this week — maybe around Thursday — he’ll make dinner for the first musher who reaches the Yukon River at Anvik, who’ll also win $3,500.Here’s the menu:• Portobello mushrooms stuffed with red king crab and smoked sockeye salmon with cheese• Alaskan clam chowder• Roasted duck salad with mixed greens• A 14-ounce ribeye steak marinated in cognac and Alaskan Amber beer• Jumbo prawns• Bacon-wrapped scallops• Grilled asparagus• Four-cheese risotto cakesDessert is a fruit tart. Four wine pairings will be served with each course, and there is also a bottle of Dom Perignon.Sidro will make all this on small burners in a tiny room, for a musher who will most likely be very sleep-deprived.“To me, you know, adventure is adventure and I want to have one,” Sidro said, “I can tell my kids one day that I’ve been there.”Sidro’s worked at the Millennium as a chef for 19 years, but this is the first time he’s been tapped to cook the Yukon River meal.“I’m a rookie, but hopefully it’s going to be fun,” Sidro said.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The DNR says HB-77 makes waterway permitting more efficient but it does limit some public input.<COL>Contentious Water Rights Bill Brings Out Huge Crowd for Public ForumThe crowd that showed up Wednesday evening for a public hearing about a contentious water rights proposal grew so large it turned into a standing-room only event.H.B. 77, a state proposal, would limit the ability of Alaskans to voice concerns over resource developments that affect waterways near their communities.The Department of Natural Resources believes the bill would make waterway permitting more efficient, but many have concerns.In a statement to KTUU, Gov. Sean Parnell said the proposal "does not change any statutes or regulations that protect fish habitat, but it does ensure that private parties are not able to stop any development by locking up our public waters."John Holman, a Bristol Bay fishing guide and lodge owner, said he disagrees with the bill."The rivers that we currently use could be changed without any public input without the process that we currently have in place, it's not a great one now but at least it's something," Holman said.That sentiment was mirrored by many in the room.H.B. 77 would do three things opponents like Holman disagree with: general permits for reoccurring activities on land and waterways, such as docks, could be issued without public notification; individuals could no longer file for in-stream water rights; and people would be required to prove they are "substantially adversely affected" before appealing approved permits."As it stands now somebody outside of the state could appeal a decision," said Tom Crafford, director of project management and permitting for DNR. "They may have nothing at play, but they have the right to appeal a DNR decision."Crafford said the changes make the department more efficient by removing that possibility; opponents believe the language used is too broad."How does it determine if I’m adversely affected?," Holman said. "I just think that there’s too many questions and there’s too much power given to DNR."That, I think, is dangerous."H.B. 77 must be voted on in the Senate and approved by Parnell before taking effect.Similar forums were held in Homer and Soldotna.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Everyone there was evacuated.While it made for a long day of work, Hoage said it was great to see the community come together to make sure the problem was addressed."It was pretty neat to see the community have such a great response and so much support," Hoage said.

Resolve-Magone Marine Services has recovered the remainder of the fuel, and plans to recover the vessel pending a break in the weather expected later this week.State officials say a fishing vessel that grounded near Dutch Harbor Nov. 1 has spilled 6,000 gallons of fuel, with recovery crews still conducting salvage work.According to a Tuesday report from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the 102-foot Arctic Hunter ran aground on the east side of Unalaska Bay, about five miles northeast of Dutch Harbor, while departing the port at about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 1.The Arctic Hunter’s crew, who were safely rescued by the fishing vessel Saga about two hours after the grounding, estimated that about 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel remained aboard the vessel. A salvage team from Resolve-Magone Marine Services has been executing a plan to recover the vessel.“As of November 5, Resolve-Magone removed an estimated 6,000 gallons of diesel fuel from the vessel,” DEC officials wrote. “The Resolve-Magone (team) estimates that approximately 6,000 gallons of diesel fuel and all the hydraulic and lubricating oil has been lost from the vessel.”According to DEC, the spill estimate includes the contents of a tank that was inaccessible and uninspected, but believed to have ruptured when the Arctic Hunter grounded.DEC project manager Jade Gamble says that the fuel loss is unfortunate, but wasn’t unanticipated.“You hope that it doesn’t, but it’s not unlikely that it would happen, given the location of those tanks and how it grounded on that rocky beach there,” Gamble said.According to Gamble, much of the fuel loss is believed to have came from a 3,500-gallon bow tank holed in the early-morning grounding.“That tank, by the time it was daylight, anyone who could have had eyes on it -- it would have dissipated,” Gamble said.While a slight sheen has been reported around the vessel, the DEC report lists no immediate impacts on wildlife in the area, including Steller’s eiders, Steller sea lions and sea otters. Gamble says the U.S. Coast Guard has periodically revisited the scene, with no issues seen.“We’ve not had reports of birds in distress or anything like that,” Gamble said.According to Gamble, Resolve-Magone is awaiting a break in the weather expected Wednesday or Thursday to resume the salvage operation, but next plans to inspect the final tank to verify that it contains no diesel fuel. Once the Arctic Hunter is removed, crews will recover any debris left at the grounding site.DEC says the cause of the grounding is under investigation by the Coast Guard.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Score the skin prior to cooking. Using a sharp or serrated knife, cut four or five shallow slashes (about 1 inch apart), through the skin of each piece of salmon. Be careful not to cut into the flesh of the salmon. This will enhance moisture in the fish as it cooks. The skin is very easy to remove after the salmon is cooked.2. Adjust oven rack to the lowest position and place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack. Heat the oven to 500 F.3. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels. Rub the fillets evenly with oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste.4. Reduce oven temperature to 275 F and remove the baking sheet. Carefully place the salmon, skin-side down, on the hot baking sheet and immediately return to the oven.5. Roast until the fish flakes apart when gently prodded with a paring knife, 9-13 minutes.6.  Gently transfer the fish to individual plates and serve with the lemon wedges.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It’s just another reason why we should go fishing this season.“Salmon is one of our best, most fruitful natural resources that we have in Alaska,” said nurse practitioner Margaret Johnson.There’s no better time to start eating salmon than right now because it’s salmon season in Alaska and everywhere you turn you’ll hear health professionals touting this “fatty fish.”“Salmon are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids--it’s a good source of fat that most all of us have heard about,” Johnson said.Doctors say omega-3 fatty acids are associated with a long list of benefits. Studies show omega-3 can lower the risk of heart disease.And it doesn’t stop there. Omega-3 fatty acids may also help with Alzheimer’s disease, eczema and asthma, not to mention it has been found to be critical in the healthy formation of the brain and eyes.Consuming fatty fish, like salmon, provides an excellent source of high-quality protein while also being low in saturated fat and cholesterol. One serving of salmon contains more vitamin D than a glass of whole milk.“Many Alaskans are deficient in Vitamin D because our winters are long, but our summer sunshine, when we have it, it’s great,” Johnson said.So if you’re in Alaska and salmon is on your plate, you’re in for a fresh healthy meal.“That’s assuming if you cook your salmon without adding a lot of salt, without frying it and if you fry you should use olive oil and there are so many spices you can use and good ways you can grill salmon,” Johnson suggests.Many Alaskans have their own unique ways of preparing fish, but if you’re looking for an easy, yet delicious suggestion for preparation, ask Johnson who says less can be more.“I prefer grilling it myself, especially on a sunny day. I just like some lemon and pepper and white wine and put it fresh on the grill,” said Johnson.A so-called fatty fish, salmon makes for a slim, healthy lifestyle.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It wasn’t immediately clear how long the man had been at the scene of the older-model Honda ATV’s crash before he was found, or how badly he was injured.“(It was) on a dirt road -- rocks and potholes but a maintained roadway,” Peters wrote in an email on the crash. “Looks like he lost control when he went close to the ditch.”As of 3:30 p.m., medics were at the scene and preparations were being made to take the man to a hospital, possibly in Anchorage. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he would be transported by ambulance or helicopter.“It’s always tricky between the Valley and Anchorage,” Peters said. “Sometimes you have to clear out landing zones.”Peters says no positive identification has been made on the man, but his injuries were sufficiently severe that attempts are being made to notify his next of kin.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Alaska supplies less than 15 percent of the world market, a number that is expected to decline as the market for fish increases with the growing world population. The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says farmed fish is now less of a competitor with Alaska holding its own in the world market.“The way we view it is that the more people that are comfortable with fish and seafood and are aware of all the positive health attributes of eating seafood, that's only a good thing for us,” said Tyson Fick, Communications Director for the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.Norway and Chile are the two leading producers of farmed salmon and China leads the world for  all types of farmed fished.Editor's Note: Channel 2's Jessica Ridgway contributed to this story.Contact: Dan Carpenter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

One pilot for the airline reported seeing a plume from the volcano rise to 26,000 feet.“We have had a couple flights affected -- one of them turned around and came back this morning,” Seybert said.According to Seybert, PenAir’s precautions -- such as refueling in King Salmon rather than Cold Bay -- haven’t added much flight time to its operations Tuesday. Most of the ash plumes are high enough that pilots can readily see and avoid them.“It’s not uncommon for us to have a volcano go off on our route structure a couple of times a year,” Seybert said.ACE Air Cargo’s sales director, Greg Hawthorne, says that while his company hasn’t had any flights canceled, it’s still keeping an eye on the situation.“Any time you have a volcano going off, you always have an issue,” Hawthorne said. “We’ve been watching it since it went off the last time.”Terry Tibbe, the operations manager at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, says no disruptions to Anchorage flights have been reported as a result of Pavlof’s eruption. She says airport officials are hoping weather conditions draw ash from the volcano out to sea.“Hopefully the wind doesn’t turn it around,” Tibbe said.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

To reduce the chance of killing incidentally-caught king salmon there, only one unbaited single-hook artificial lure can be used within the river drainage below Karluk Lake, including the lagoon.The Ayakulik River drainage is restricted to non-retention of all king salmon, regardless of size, and only one unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure may be used there.Returns in both rivers are coming up significantly short of escapement goals set by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.Donn Tracy, a sport fish biologist for the department, said that’s why the decision was made. But the low numbers are not taking anyone by surprise, and it’s not all bad news for fishing in Kodiak.“Karluk River king salmon run was designated as stock of concern in 2011,” Tracy said. “The Ayakulik River, which is the other natural or native king salmon run in Kodiak archipelago, is also having poor runs. But neither were expected to be strong.”A bright spot is that there has been a “real, viable” hatchery run of king salmon along the Kodiak road system, Tracy said. “If the trend continues of strong returns for sockeye runs, I suspect we’ll be increasing sport fishing.”(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

On Monday the river was open for 24 hours, the first all day opener of the season. The Copper River is known the world over for its Chinook and Sockeye but the fish markets have had to be patient this season after a late breakup. Before Monday there had been only 3 commercial openers on the river. Fish and Game said not enough fish were making it past sonar counter. A cold spring kept the river frozen longer than normal followed by a quick melt with fast and cool waters for the fish to navigate.“It’s very unusual to keep the commercial fishery to be closed this long especially it was just kind of the perfect storm of conditions and passage,” said Jeremy Botz and Area Management Biologist with Fish and Game.With the warmer temperatures Fish and Game says the runs are starting to improve. Botz said Monday will likely break the daily record for the salmon finding their way past sonar and into the Copper River.Contact: Dan Carpenter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

We just have to be calm, we can't grab anything -- wait for the instruction of ‘OK, he’s there,’ because basically, we want him to grab that and turn downstream.”Our lines get a few nibbles, but nothing takes hard enough to hook.“Cleaned me,” Kuepper said, holding up a line empty of bait. “Probably the biggest fish of my life.”We keep our bait fresh and lines clean, but it doesn't seem anyone is having real luck.We stay at it till the current goes flat, and it's time to throw in the towel. While the odds were against this time, it'll just be a greater return for the next.With nice weather prevailing we suggest spending time out at Sand Lake, stocked with Arctic char, grayling and rainbow trout.There’s trout fishing in Clunie Lake, as well as lakes in the Mat-Su Valley.On the Kenai River, people keep picking up rainbow and Dolly Varden trout as well.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

An indefinite closure, taking effect at 6 a.m. Friday, will also bar sport fishing on the Susitna River near a fish weir operated by Fish and Game.In addition, all king salmon fishing -- including catch-and-release fishing -- will close within one statute mile of Cook Inlet’s shore between the latitudes of Bluff Point and the Ninilchik River, from June 15 through July 15.The department attributed the closures to sporadically met escapement goals for kings on the Anchor and Ninilchik rivers, as well as salmon harvest patterns in Cook Inlet.“To minimize the shifting of effort due to conservation actions for the Anchor and Ninilchik rivers, it is warranted to restrict sport fishing on Deep and Stariski creeks as well,” officials wrote. “King salmon of Cook Inlet origin generally have a higher probability of being harvested near shore than do king salmon from other locations. Mature king salmon (spawners) also tend to be harvested near shore at a greater rate than immature (non-local) king salmon.”While fishing will continue after the stream restrictions pass, Fish and Game says kings still may not be harvested.“Anglers are reminded that when these streams open to sport fishing on July 16, king salmon may not be targeted, and any king salmon caught while fishing for other species may not be removed from the water and must be released immediately,” officials wrote.Fish and Game says details on the affected stream areas, as well as the dates on which individual restrictions take effect, are as follows:Anchor River: From its mouth upstream to junction of the North and South forks will close to sport fishing on Saturday, June 15, 2013, at 12:01 a.m.Ninilchik River and Deep Creek: From the mouth upstream approximately two miles to ADF&G regulatory markers will close to sport fishing on Monday, July 1, 2013, at 12:01 a.m.Stariski Creek: From its mouth upstream to the Sterling Highway Bridge will close to sport fishing on Monday, July 1, 2013, at 12:01 a.m.Susitna River: Sport fishing within 1,500 feet immediately downstream and 300 feet upstream of the department’s fish weir on the Little Susitna River at river mile 32.5 will close to all sport fishing beginning at 6:00 a.m., Friday, June 14.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Some Alaska anglers may recall DIDSON, the fish counting technology that’s been in place for 6 years.“The DIDSON has 512 pixels that can define an image,” said Alaska Fish & Game Scientist Debbie Burwen.  “ARIS can go up to 4,000 pixels to define an image.”Fish and Game says ARIS will be used to provide a clearer picture of what’s happening underwater, so a king won’t be misidentified as another species of fish, or vice-versa.  The images are captured from on-shore and off-shore cameras at stations along the Kenai River.“Going forward is one thing, but how we interpret the past is another matter,” said Kenai Sport Fishing Association President Ricky Gease.Gease says he’s thrilled with the technology upgrade, but remains concerned the state is using data still collected under the old system, and using previous information to project future escapement goals.“What we urge Fish and Game to do is take a very cautious approach to those past numbers because they’ve been shown to be in error, and have a wider degree of uncertainty to it,” said Gease.Gease would prefer Fish and Game use the latest technology to ensure accuracy whenever and wherever possible.The state hopes the technology will be the latest in a series of possible improvements to satisfy Alaskan’s need to fish and mother nature’s need for balance.“It’s a better instrument, it is the next generation, it’s more powerful, more flexible,” adds ADF&G’s Burwen.Officials say some of the equipment being used along the Kenai costs up to $100,000. The project has been funded by the state for the next two years and a second ARIS location could open five miles downstream.Contact Adam Pinsker(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Under the current rules, communities with more than 7,000 people would be considered non-rural, unless they possess significant “rural characteristics.”The towns of Bethel, Sitka, Kodiak and Ketchikan all have populations at or near that number. Many groups, including corporations formed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and tribes, are asking to increase the threshold to a higher number.“We get a lot of comments insisting on the importance of subsistence itself and how communities think that it's been undervalued in the process of making rural determinations,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Subsistence Policy Coordinator David Jenkins.The meeting will run until Thursday at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service building at 1011 E.

The population increases tenfold in the summer to support the most profitable commercial sockeye fishery in the world.While other areas of the state have seen commercial fishing hurt by low king salmon returns, Bristol Bay remains a strong economic engine.The mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough, Daniel O’Hara, says fishing's importance to the region is like oil's importance to the State of Alaska.“It’s a big provider for the schools, you know, it’s a seasonal type thing so you have many many jobs that come because of it,” O’Hara said.He estimates revenue from fishing makes of 75 percent of the Borough’s budget.“This truly is the sockeye capitol of the world -- everything that happens in Bristol Bay comes through this borough,” O'Hara said.Commercial setnetters like Gregory Harris are gearing up for another year of catching sockeye salmon. Harris bought back into the fishery last year after a 20-year break from the industry, when he saw the potential to make money again."We've got a really strong run," Harris said. "The Kvichak River where we fish -- the headwaters of the Kvichak River which empties out of Lake Iliamna -- is historically the largest of all of Bristol Bay. And it's coming back, and we're benefiting from it, and I'm optimistic."Slim Morstad, a commercial fisheries biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, says he's seen low returns in the past, but this year's run is looking strong."We're forecasting for this year a harvest of about 16 to 18 million," Morstad said. "That's quite a bit, more than any part of the state has.”Morstad says the diversity and abundance of the salmon runs come in cycles but local geography plays an important role.“We have the big lakes and the huge spawning system and the small streams that run to these large lakes, a lot of rearing habitat,” Morstad said.While Bristol Bay communities prepare for another profitable fishing season, the fishermen themselves get ready to cash in on the bounty of sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay.Contact Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"They know that it's sustainable we have it written into our state constitution so there is a lot of demand for our salmon."The Fred Meyer on Dimond was the first and only one of its stores to receive some of the first catch.David Sanz, a seafood buyer and category manager with Fred Meyer says the store supports selling sustainable fish like the Copper River salmon.“It doesn't get a whole lot fresher than this," Sanz said.

"The prime directive of fish and game is to protect and maintain that natural productivity."DIPAC is one of several non-profit hatcheries in Alaska.  Its board of directors is made up of 32 people representing gillnetters, set netters, commercial fisherman, subsistence, the general public and the Juneau Borough.Currently DIPAC is rearing only four of the five species of salmon: chum, Chinook, Coho and Sockeye.DIPAC’s goal is to enhance the northern inside waters of Southeast Alaska."20, 30 percent of the Salmon catch is fish produced by enhancing organizations statewide, that's a big deal," added Prestigard.DIPAC isn't the only organization tracking salmon.  Paula Dobbyn of Trout Unlimited led a group of mostly commercial and sport fisherman to Washington D.C. this March to lobbyCongressto pass legislation called Tongass 77."We've identified 77 high value watersheds for salmon, that are currently open to development,” said Dobbyn.  “We would really like to see the forest service manage those watersheds for salmon first, because salmon are such an important species for the region."Dobbyn fears that if these watersheds aren’t protected, salmon runs could decline sharply.  She says mining; logging and privatization are contributing to the decline of salmon in California, Oregon and Washington."They're people whose livelihoods are directly tied to healthy habitats, healthy forests,” added Dobbyn.  “They went back there with the message, hey things are good in the Tongass now for Salmon, but they could be a lot better."DIPAC is also doing its part in making sure salmon enhancement efforts aren't jeopardizing wild stocks.  They do this by determining the interaction between the enhanced fish and wild fish and if there's any sort of reduction in fitness by having enhanced fish stray into a wild system."It’s a 12 year study, we're going to track these fish, and we’ll do a genetic pedigree, so we'll be able to say,” said Prestigard.Scientists say there are environmental elements beyond their control that will always jeopardize natural production, but overall, the state of southeast Alaska’s salmon is strong."On the whole, the trend for Alaska Salmon is good, there are certainly some stocks that are down right now, people are very aware of Chinook in Cook Inlet, there stocks are down, Southeast stocks are doing well,” added Fish & Game’s Rabung.At DIPAC, the millions of salmon incubating here will eventually go through the same spawning process as their wild counterparts and Prestigard invites you to taste the difference."We could sit you down right now and have 4 different plates of salmon, and one or two of them could be an enhanced fish and you would never know the difference."For more than a generation state leaders, fisherman and conservationists have sought to make a difference by preserving Alaska’s salmon stocks.CORRECTION: In "49th Report: The State of Fish" broadcast, Channel 2 News inaccurately referenced a statement by Paula Dobbyn's of Trout Unlimited. In Adam Pinsker's story, "Wild Salmon vs. Farmed Salmon," Dobbyn's refered to declining runs of salmon as Pinsker referenced Southeast Alaska. Dobbyn's quote was in actuality a direct reference to declining salmon runs in the Lower 48 in states such as California and Oregon, NOT in Southeast Alaska.

While the judge in the case agreed free religious exercise protections apply, the Chinook salmon need to be protected.Last June, the Kuskokwim River was closed for seven days to subsistence fishing of king salmon. When that closure was extended another five days, some fishermen decided to fish anyway at the urging of elders.The State charged 60 fishermen with using gillnets in violation of the emergency order aimed at allowing king salmon to meet escapement goals. Most of the defendants pleaded guilty or were fined.On Monday, acting District Court Judge Bruce Ward read a seven page memorandum decision affecting the remaining 22 defendants.He argued religion is involved with subsistence harvesting of king salmon, but the need to protect king salmon overcomes the argued free exercise exemption for religious practices.Subsistence fishermen are watching the trial closely and some say despite the ruling against their defense, agreement by the state that subsistence practices are protected on religious grounds is a win.“In a nutshell, I think it's a good day for all of us and we made huge gains on our hunting and fishing rights,” Mike Williams, a subsistence fishermen and tribal leader, said.Defendants in the case are being represented by the Northern Justice Project free of charge. Defense attorney James Davis says he’s extraordinarily excited by what the ruling supporting subsistence practices as a religious practice holds, but says he plans on appealing the charges.On Monday, the first ten defendants took the stand to express how subsistence fishing is tied to their spiritual practices. When asked how they felt when they were prevented from fishing, many men became emotional.“Most of the fishermen, even elders who'd been fishing their entire lives, old tough guys, would break down and crying in court - open court in front of their community, even though Yupik men pride themselves on never showing those types of emotions in public,” Davis said.Those charged on Monday were ordered to pay fines ranging from $50 to $500.Contact: Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The aquatic plants can have severe effects if unchecked, and easily spread by attachment to plane floats or boat hulls, and can asexually reproduce in other bodies of water.“Ecological impacts include reduced water quality, increased sedimentation, native vegetation displacement, and degraded salmon spawning habitat,” officials wrote. “Elodea can also impact recreation use by entangling outboard motors, decreasing fishing opportunities, and creating undesirable conditions for swimming and wading.”The state anticipates treating Stormy and Daniels lakes to halt their Elodea infestations this summer.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Wassillie's remains were sent to the state medical examiner's office in Anchorage where an autopsy revealed that he died "as a result of drowning and blunt force injuries to the head," according to Campion.An Alaska State Troopers dispatch released Thursday afternoon says additional investigation established that Nowatak had been driving an ATV, while Wassillie rode with her. Prosecutors say Nowatak was drunk at the time.“While traveling southwest along the shoreline of Lake Iliamna near Kokhanok, the 4-wheeler struck a stump on the beach causing both to be ejected from the 4-wheeler with (Wassillie) being ejected into Lake Iliamna,” troopers wrote. “Brenda Nowatak left the scene without rendering assistance to (Wassillie) who subsequently drowned as a result of the incident.”Nowatak has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, leaving the scene of an accident and DUI.After a grand jury indicted Nowatak Wednesday and an arrest warrant for her was issued, she was arrested Thursday and taken to King Salmon, where she is being held on $10,000 bail.Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Contact Jessica RidgwayCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

All five men are reportedly in good condition, and were expected to be taken to Adak.While Coast Guardsmen credit the Western Venture’s crew with being prepared to use their rescue gear, they also emphasize the importance of the initial beacon signals in rescuing the men.“This case illustrates the importance of not only having an EPIRB, but properly registering it to provide rescuers with vital information to aid in the response,” said Lt. Colin Boyle, a search and rescue controller with the 17th District command center. “The PLB and EPIRB alerts were our first and only indication of this maritime emergency.”According to the Coast Guard, the Western Venture remains afloat and burning, with an estimated 4,300 gallons of diesel fuel and other oils aboard. Coast Guard officials are investigating the fire’s cause, and will consult with the vessel’s owners about the feasibility of a salvage effort.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The FAA says it's looking at transferring the observers' duties to certified air traffic controllers at the end of the fiscal year.Currently, CWOs are responsible for evaluating temperatures, wind ceiling and augmenting an automated service observation system.Steven Fuller, a full-time contract weather observer at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, says that as FAA officials move his duties to air traffic controllers, they won't be able to assess unanticipated changes -- like a shift from rain to freezing rain -- quite like he can."There's going to be a question of training, of how qualified they are to determine those kinds of things, and we've had it change here on a dime and from rain -- and it wasn't even in the forecast that there would be freezing precipitation," Fuller said.The FAA closed 14 CWO programs in the Lower 48 Wednesday. The next round of scheduled closures, expected to will affect 24 locations, will happen no later than July 15. Five of them are in Alaska including King Salmon and Bethel, as well as Fairbanks and Juneau's international airports and Merrill Field in Anchorage.Fuller says he's worried the changes could reduce the quality of the weather reports."You have to really ask yourself if that is a good time to have controllers having an additional duty of doing weather observations, on top of what they're already handling," Fuller said.The FAA defended the changes in a statement, saying they would provide the same level of service more efficiently."Air traffic controllers currently provide quality weather observations at more than 300 airports around the country," FAA officials wrote. "The FAA pays contractors to provide those same services at an additional 140 facilities around the country. In an effort to reduce costs without reducing the services or impacting safety, the FAA has been working through a phased plan to train controllers to take over those duties from the contractors."After further reviewing its plans, the FAA says it's decided to extend its weather observer contracts through the fiscal year, to allow for more input from stakeholders on how to proceed going forward.According to the plan, CWOs at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport could feel its effects starting Aug. 15.Contact Samantha AngaiakCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Working in seafood could have longevity beyond the summer season."You can basically start off in January being if you're on one of the vessels or working in dutch harbor and when that's done you can come back and work the herring season, from there the employers usually invite you back to go work the salmon season," Dosier said.State economist Neal Fried says job opportunities in Alaska are thriving across the employment spectrum, but he admits seasonal jobs are the top ticket right now."Seafood is sort of the epitome of those seasonal jobs,” Fried said. “There are fishing and seafood processing jobs all year long in Alaska, but there are way more in the summer time than any other time in the year.”Fried says seasonal jobs will grow from 3,000 in December to more than 20,000 during their peak in July or August each year."Numbers are only going up and they're only going to go up for the next 3 or 4 months," Fried said.That means whether you're a fisherman or seeking other types of seasonal employment, opportunities in Alaska look to be a great catch.Contact Samantha AngaiakCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

And that's not uncommon. What's going on?There are really two main types of muscle soreness:1. The soreness you might experience during or immediately after exercise.It usually goes away very quickly and can be blamed on the by-products of muscle metabolism, which involves getting enough oxygen to your cells so they can do their job.2. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).It usually comes on about 24 to 48 hours after exercise, then decreases after about 72 hours. DOMS is a natural body process that's due to microscopic tears in the muscles and surrounding connective tissues. It's when your muscles rebuild that you get stronger and start to see some of that sculpted muscle tone. This soreness is actually a sign that yourworkoutis working.Now, on to the important part...relief!Just ChillIf you find that the soreness is so bad that it's affecting your daily activities, put it on ice. Try applying bags of frozen vegetables (peas work well) to the affected area -- they conform to your body and are more comfortable than a hard block of ice. Avoid the urge to take a long, hot bath or get into a hot tub or sauna immediately after a workout. In addition to being dehydrating, heat can increaseinflammation.Find Help OTCMany people find that taking an anti-inflammatory medicine like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen when they have some muscle soreness can help ease thepain. As a group, these medications are known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and generally do a good job at helping you feel better fairly quickly by reducing some of the inflammation in your muscles,joints, and connective tissue. Just be careful of taking too many of these pills at once: Chronic use can lead to stomach,liver, orkidneyproblems, in some cases to a very serious degree.Try Herbal SoothersNatural health experts often recommendarnicafor treating soreness and swelling. This plant can be used in several forms, including creams, salves, ointments, gels, and tinctures. Massage the natural medicine into your muscles for a soothing rubdown. (Never apply to brokenskinor an open wound.) You can also try rubbing with somewitch hazelas a gentle way to soothe sore muscles.Enjoy a Muscle-Relief MenuCertain foods are considered natural anti-inflammatories. Omega-3 fatty acids, for one -- like those found in salmon and other cold-water fish,walnuts, andflaxseeds -- have been shown to help reduce inflammation in the body. If you're not a fan of fish, you can try takingfish oilsupplements.Fruits and vegetables can also help. Studies have shown thatquercetin, a phytochemical found inapplesand redonions, among other foods, has strong anti-inflammatory properties.And be sure you're drinking plenty of fluids to help flush the waste products out of your body. Water is best -- for flavor, dress it up withlemon, orange,lime, or even cucumber slices.Source: http://resources.purematters.com/fitness/sports-injuries/muscles-moaning-try-these-ingredients-for-reliefDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Before the season even starts there were fewer tourists, fewer clients available for the summer before it even started."From Thursday, May 16, to June 30, Kenai River anglers are prohibited from harvesting king salmon between 20 and 55 inches in length, which must be released immediately. Kings shorter than 20 inches or longer than 55 inches may still be harvested.In addition, the department prohibits the use of bait while sport fishing in waters of the Kenai River -- only an unbaited, single-hook, artificial lure may be used.The department’s decision to issue the restriction comes with its strategy to maintain an optimal escapement goal for early-run kings of between 5,300 and 9,000 fish."There is little indication to date of a change in the low Chinook production trend observedstatewide," officials wrote. "It is therefore prudent to start the early run fishery as catch-and-release until inseason data indicates some harvest can be allowed or alternatively further restriction is necessary to meet the OEG."According to Vania, Fish and Game is taking a more careful tack as a result of that outlook.“We feel it’s prudent to start out the fishery more conservative than what the existing regulations are already,” Vania said. “We’re going to start out slow and see how the run develops.”McClure says he doesn’t have a problem with the new restrictions, since the health of the resource comes first. He does have a problem, however, with Fish and Game issuing Monday's order based on a preseason forecast -- rather than waiting until early June, when it could make a decision based on real data.“That's part of the problem,” McClure said.  “They told us they were going to do that and they didn't, they changed their mind. Now we're having to scramble and go back to people and say, 'Well, hate to tell you this, even though you've already booked your trip and you're coming to Alaska -- the department changed their mind this week.'"Steve McClure, president of the Kenai River Professional Guide Association, says the continued restrictions will have a huge impact not only on the Kenai Peninsula, but also the entire state.“There are people that aren’t going to come,” said McClure. “We’re already seeing the effects of the downturn and the restrictions from last year.

On the Kenai Peninsula, that thread is symbolized by the Kenai River and the king salmon it brings.<COL>Fishing is a thread running through the fabric of many Alaska communities. On the Kenai Peninsula, that thread is symbolized by the Kenai River and the king salmon it brings.In a small workshop in Soldotna, strong fishing line is spun onto spools and threaded through fishing poles. Greg Brush is gearing up for another season as a sport-fishing guide.“I came up here and started deck handling and then guiding, and then I started my own business and built it up through the years -- and I’m still going,” Brush said.Brush has seen 23 fishing seasons on the Kenai Peninsula, and says he has noticed a change in the foundation of his business.“I’ve seen things change in the sense that it seems like -- at least it feels like -- there’s less king salmon, and the average size of them is getting smaller,” Brush said.As he begins his 24th season on the Kenai, Brush says he’s stopped taking king salmon out of concern for the survival of the fish."Everybody’s taking, taking, taking at a high rate," Brush said. "Let’s just slow the taking down, figure out what’s going on in the ocean, and then we’re more conservative in our management and we will have fish for the future."Brush says he’s tired of pointing the finger at who’s taking the fish. He says he’s made the personal decision to go to catch-and-release fishing for Kenai kings,"So I’m done arguing about what is mine, cause it isn’t mine," Brush said. "I’m ready to say, 'What can I do about it?'"Concern for the king salmon is shared by the Kenai River Sportfishing Association. Its executive director, Ricky Gease, says he’s very concerned for Soldotna after last year’s low returns resulted in an estimated economic loss of $30 million.“It impacts our community in many, many different ways,” Gease said. “On the Kenai, in terms of king salmon, these are the largest salmon in the world; people from all over the world come to fish king salmon here, and it’s very important that we ensure the sustainability of this river.”Last year’s low king salmon predictions resulted in the closure of the gillnet fishery. Setnetters fishing the east side of Cook Inlet mainly target sockeye salmon, but were prevented from fishing for most of their season to ensure that as many kings as possible passed their nets."We pretty much lost 99 percent of our season," said Travis Every, a commercial east-side setnetter. "We had one opener within our regulation time in July, which pretty much cost us 99 percent of the bulk of our season."Every, a third generation commercial fisherman, is worried about the financial impact to his business and the community if the gillnet fishery is closed again.“If we have another year like 2012 it’s going to hurt a lot of people; there’s going to be a lot of people that probably won’t be able to make it,” Every said.According to Every, a lot of people are talking about trawlers taking kings as bycatch, incidentally caught while targeting other fish. He also points to too many kings being allowed to escape in the past.“There is a trickle-down effect just like with sockeye. We don’t, we can’t have two million sockeye go up the river -- you can’t have forty to fifty thousand kings in the river either,” Every said.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has started the season with an emergency order, requiring release of any king salmon caught between 20 and 55 inches. Bait is also prohibited.This fishing season carries another tide of unease for local businesses, as the salmon so many depend on begin their return.Contact Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The married couple live in Bethel, a regional hub for Southwest Alaska.<COL>For Louie and Helena Andrew, subsistence fishing on the Kuskokwim River has been a way of life for more than 50 years. The married couple live in Bethel, a regional hub for Southwest Alaska.The Andrews say fishing and hunting are an important part of their Yup’ik culture.“The people themselves, even my wife and I, have connections to everything that’s in the waters, on the land, and in the air,” said Louie Andrew, a traditional chief with the Orutsararmiut Native Council.According to the Andrews that connection also extends to king salmon, which have become scarce in the waters of the Kuskokwim just outside their riverfront home.Last year, the couple caught just four kings after the Alaska Department of Fish and Game closed the river to subsistence fishing for 12 days. Gear restrictions were also issued aimed at helping king salmon reach the state’s escapement goal. They say they ate other fish instead of kings and made it through the winter with the help of subsistence caught ptarmigan and caribou provided by family members.“We’re living in a difficult world right now,” said Louie Andrew, “The people in a way themselves are affected.”The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also works to maintain a sustainable king salmon run. The federal agency says fewer of the fish have been returning to the Kuskokwim for the past eight years.Dan Gillikin, a USFWS fisheries biologist, says there is enough harvesting in the Kuskokwim's subsistence fishery alone to jeopardize the long term sustainability of kings on the river.“Abundance should be starting to increase, however last year was a good example of (when) we thought we would see greater numbers of fish returning to the Kuskokwim but we didn't,” Gillikin said.Dozens of people defied the subsistence closure last year and went fishing on the advice of Yup’ik elders. Nets and salmon were taken by Alaska State Troopers tasked with enforcing the closure. Rather than pay a fine, 22 people went on trial, claiming they have a right to fish based on religious grounds. In April the state conceded that subsistence practices are entitled to the free-exercise protections other religions have, but the trial continues.There is some support in the region for the management decisions aimed at protecting kings. John Wuya, a commercial fisherman, says protest fishing isn’t the answer."We’ve got to do what we can now," Wuya said. "I mean, it’s not just for us; it’s not just here today. I mean, it’s for our kids, it’s for our grandkids."Beverly Hoffman, a co-chair with the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group, also supported the closure.“What was happening was that we were forced to make some very tough decisions about closures, even as a working group,” Hoffman said. “We have a responsibility as a people to be a part of the solution, and that’s very important -- that all stakeholders have a real understanding of how important it is that fish make it to the escapement grounds.”In mid-May the Kuskokwim River was still locked in ice, delaying the fishing season. While families like the Andrews work to maintain a traditional way of life, state and federal scientists work to ensure king salmon return to the river.Contact Dan CarpenterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Murkowski told Channel 2 News on Friday.  "This is a fund that is already paid for by the crabbers and by the processors."Murkowski, along with Rep. Don Young (R-AK) and Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA) wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, urging her to use her powers under the "Anti-Deficiency Act" to open up the crab season.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Proposal 41 would have direct impact on the community if passed, making Bethel a non-subsistence area, and limiting hunting and fishing to personal use, sport use and commercial use only.Frank Woods, Chairman of the Nushagak Advisory Committee, says his concerns were mainly about depleting resources."There's a huge competition for resource that we don't have enough out there to satisfy everybody's needs and we just keep at least rural communities want to maintain the current harvest rates that we have right now," Woods said.Stephen Maxie flew to Anchorage from his home in Napaskiak to let the board know how the rule would impact not only Bethel residents, but surrounding villages as well if it passed."Villages that are neighboring Bethel […] there's going to be boundary issues where a lot of Bethel subsistence users that want to hunt, fish and game are going to come into our areas," Maxie said.Maxie says it's unclear as to why the proposal was made in the first place."I don't even know why this proposal is coming up," Maxie said. "It's nonsense and baseless."Orville Huntington, a member of the Board of Fisheries, says the proposal is something the legislature mandates at certain points in time for subsistence communities to be reviewed, like Kodiak and Bethel."I'm still doing my homework on both of them to understand the issues because there's so many user groups with varied interests in both communities," Huntington said.Robert Aloysius, who was selected by the Kuskokwim Fish and Game advisory committee to chair the organization, also testified on Proposal 41."We live off the land, we don't have a subsistence lifestyle like other people say we do," Aloysius said. "We have a subsistence way of life because it's governed by the seasons. In the summertime we fish, in the fall time we gather, winter time we're trapping and rejuvenating for the spring."The joint Board of Fisheries and Game will deliberate and is expected to take a vote on all proposals later in the week.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

I drinkCelestial Seasonings Morning Thundertea in a big beer stein, which I believe to be quite manly.I also hate to throw out anything I could reuse or recycle. So I scoured the Internet to find 50 uses for used tea bags and tea, other the primary functions of keeping me hydrated and awake. With thanks to "Reader’s Digest" and "Mental Floss" magazines, the Boulder Dushanbe Tea House, Chinaculture.org and several bloggers and Web forums, here is the definitive list of other uses for tea. We can’t vouch for all these home remedies, as we aren’t able to test all 50 of these items, so let us know how they work. Also tell us if we missed anything.Cleaning:1. Clean carpets:Clean up musty, dirty carpetsby sprinkling dry, used green tea leaves on the carpet. Let them work their magic for about 10 minutes, then vacuum them up.2. Clean antique rugs:Delicate Persian and Oriental rugs can also benefit from a sprinkling of tea leaves. In this case, sprinkle nearly dry, used whole tea leaves on the rugs, and gently sweep them away.3. Shine wood floors:The tannins in black tea can help shine and color hardwood flooring. Follow your regular floor cleaning routine by carefully rubbing some brewed tea into the floor (don’t use too much water on hardwood flooring) and letting it air dry.4. Polish furniture:Brewed tea also can help clean and shine wood furniture. Dip a soft cloth in a small amount of tea, and use it to wipe down the tables, chairs and more.5. Clean mirrors and windows:Tea can remove stubborn, greasy fingerprints from glass, and make it sparkle. Simply rub a damp teabag on the glass or fill a spray bottle with brewed tea.6. Clean toilet stains:Rumor has it that used tea bags can magically remove stubborn stains in the bottom of the toilet bowl. Just leave them in the toilet for several hours, then flush the toilet and brush the bowl.7. Get rid of fishy smells:Rinse your hands with tea after eating or preparing fish (or other stinky foods) to eliminate odors.8. De-stink fridges:Instead of baking soda (or maybe in addition), try used tea bags in the fridge to absorb odors.9. De-stink cat litter:Likewise, used tea leaves can help deodorize litter boxes when mixed into the litter. Dry, green tealeaves are recommended.10.Prevent fleas:Tea is also rumored to help prevent fleas, so sprinkle some dry used tealeaves around pet bedding.11. Kill dust mites:Carefully spray diluted black tea on the carpet to kill dust mites. Color-test the tea first in an inconspicuous spot.12. Clean the fireplace:Sprinkling wet tealeaves on fireplace ashes while scooping them out may help reduce blowing dust.13. Make potpourri:The herbs and flowers in used herbal tea bags may have run out of flavor, but they often still have a good scent. Dry out herbal tea bags and add to potpourri or scented sachets.14.Make a car air freshener:Likewise, you can freshen up the car without a chemical-laden commercial air freshener. Put lavender tea or other soothing herbal tea in a bag under the seat to fight odors.Personal:15. Soothe a sunburn:Wet teabags can soothe sunburns and other minor burns. For a full-body sunburn, soak in a tea bath.16. Soothe tired eyes:Warm, wet teabags can reduce puffiness and soothe pain around tired eyes — and teabags on your eyes look a little less ridiculous than cucumber slices.17. Soothe pinkeye:You can also use warm, wet teabags as a compress to soothe the pain of pinkeye.18. Soothe razor burn:A wet tea bag can also reduce and soothe razor burn.No email address was supplied by.

With so much conflicting information on necessity and quality, it’s hard to determine what’s right for my son and what’s gratuitous. Interestingly enough, new findings were revealed this week that help make my decision easier: over one-third of American children aren’t meeting calcium and vitamin D recommendations.In fact, calcium and vitamin D intakes were low for all children, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements who released the surprising data this week in the Journal of Pediatrics. Taylor Wallace, PhD, and senior director at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the data is “eye-opening because calcium and vitamin D deficiency is not only important in elderly women but a large segment of children are not getting enough.”  The data also revealed that non-supplement user children had a much higher incidence of insufficient intakes of calcium, vitamins A and C, magnesium and phosphorus when compared to supplement user children.So how can we help our children meet their calcium and vitamin D daily recommendations? Two ways: we can addfoods high in calcium and vitamin Dto their diet and we can give them clinically-tested, high-quality supplements that contain the right amount of daily nutrients. Foods high in calcium include spinach, kale, soybeans, and foods that are calcium-fortified like orange juice and breakfast cereal. Good sources for vitamin D include fatty fish (like tuna and salmon), cheese, and egg yolks.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/news/surprising-data-reveals-vitamin-deficiency-in-over-one-third-of-american-children-todays-newsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Hallstrom, known for his great behind the scenes work on "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen" (2011), "Chocolat" (2000), "The Cider House Rules" (1999) and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" (1993) can usually eek out wonderful performances from his actors, no matter what the challenges. He had some success in his last Nicholas Sparks novel-to-film direction, "Dear John," so he does know the turf.But with "Safe Haven," the obstacles must have proven to be too great. Julianne Hough, who has parlayed an acting career out of being a singer and dancer, is given the task of leading lady, a woman on the run from an abusive husband and a plot that's almost a carbon copy of Julia Roberts' 1991 on-the-run-from-crazy-hubby romance "Sleeping with the Enemy."Josh Duhamel is the small-town sensitive widower, Alex, who is running a seaside grocery store in a Norman Rockwell-esque North Carolina town. It's the kind of store where you can buy pork rinds, basmati rice and paint all in the same swoop. He's raising two small children and is experience growing pains as a newly singled father.Katie (Hough) has boarded a bus from Boston to Atlanta to flee the abuse at the hands of her alcoholic husband, but a pit stop in the tiny town gives her pause and she decides to make the place her last stop.She's welcomed into the town easily, getting a job at a seafood shack, and, of course, catching the eye of the handsome widower.Based on Nicholas Sparks' book, "Safe Haven" is a sappy love story that is sure to draw its female fan base to this film, but adds an extra twist for men with a thriller injection. In the film, however, it somehow serves to knock the whole thing off balance, creating a jarring effect for the thriller-esque final half hour.Hollywood has been chasing the success it had with Sparks' "The Notebook," but that magical formula remains elusive. Duhamel and Hough are pretty enough together, but, no pun intended, the sparks never really fly. David Lyons as the off-his-rocker husband is unbelievably bad to the bone, although his dastardly portrayal does get him much applause when he does meet with misfortune.The upshot of the film is it does a fine job with drawing audiences into this picture-perfect world -- a small town where everyone's welcome and a Fourth of July parade is lauded as a major event. Cinematographer Terry Stacey creates a dreamy palette of locations, including a canoeing scene that is escapist fare at its finest.If everything were as balanced, including Hallstrom's direction (his constant interjecting of the Boston subplot is jarring and, honestly, annoying), "Safe Haven" might be a memorable Sparks swooner. This one just looks like it was churned out in time for the Valentine's Day date-night movie rush. Regardless, Sparks fans will eat it up like a box of V-Day chocolates.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Replace junk food with these staples and try some of my tips for choosing healthier options at the grocery store.Fill your fridge with the colors of the rainbow.You really can’t go wrong with any fresh fruits or vegetables, just make sure that you choose a variety of these nutrient-rich plant foods daily and make them a part of every meal and snack. Some of my top superfood picks include: spinach, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, kale, oranges, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and squash. While it’s fine to stock up on your favorites, consider trying a new food from the produce section every week. Not only will you improve your nutrient intake this way, but you’ll expand your taste buds too!Whole grains should get first dibs in your pantry to help maximize your weight loss efforts.Researchers have shown that women who eat more whole grains consistently weigh less than those who eat less of these fiber-rich foods. The great thing about whole grains is they can last a long time in your pantry, so stock up. Be sure you choose “whole” rather than refined grains, and avoid the processed versions, which typically have much of the nutrition stripped away–not to mention added salt, sugar, and preservatives. Think rolled oats, brown and wild rice, quinoa, ready-to-eat high-fiber cereals, and 100% whole grain breads and pasta.Make protein packed foods a kitchen staple.Fill your fridge and pantry with poultry, fish, shellfish (e.g., shrimp and scallops), eggs, non-fat milk and greek yogurt, low-fat cheese, soymilk, tofu, beans and lentils (dried and/or canned), nuts/seeds, and nut butters. If you include protein-rich foods as a part of every meal and snack you will stay satisfied, eat less, and lose weight faster than if you skimped on the protein.It’s easy to sabotage your weight loss efforts if you aren’t careful with your fat intake.Fat is one of those tricky components of any weight loss endeavor because it contains more calories per gram than protein and carbs. In other words, a little fat goes a long way. First off, don’t buy the fat-laden sweets and snacks like pastries, chips, processed meats (e.g., bacon, sausage, and hot dogs), butter and full-fat dairy (e.g., whole milk, ice cream). If they aren’t in your house, you are less likely to eat them. Instead choose healthy fats from foods like salmon and tuna (fresh and canned in water), nuts/seeds, nut butters, avocado, and olive oil. Importantly, eating fewer saturated fats and choosing more unsaturated and essential fats can shift your body’s fat-burning mechanisms into high gear.Beverages can make or break your weight loss efforts.If you’re drinking sodas, Frappuccinos, lattes, and sweetened juice or energy drinks everyday, you could easily add more than 20 pounds to your body weight every year–from these liquids alone. Even if you’re exercising on a regular basis, consuming these high-calorie beverages means you’ll have to work extra hard to burn off these empty calories. Stick primarily to water, but mix it up with green tea and coffee (sweetened with a natural, no-calorie sweetener such as stevia if desired), non-fat milk or soymilk. For a special treat, try seltzer water with a splash of 100% fruit juice and a lemon, lime, or orange slice for extra zing.Wondering if you should forever avoid the snack aisle? Of course not!While processed snack foods can easily increase your daily calorie intake, if you are careful with portion sizes and make wise choices, then indulging in a healthy treat makes sense. Think 100 percent fruit sorbet, popcorn, trail mix, dried fruit (e.g., raisins, figs, dates), dark chocolate, non-fat frozen yogurt, and high-fiber muffins. Be sure to pair your snack with some produce and/or protein for staying power. For example, an apple and high fiber muffin.Don’t forget about freezer basics.Frozen fruits and vegetables provide a nourishing alternative to fresh produce and can help you prepare a healthy meal or snack when you’re in a pinch. Edamame (soybeans in the pod), peas, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, corn, and veggie stir-fry combos go from the freezer to plate in no time. Berries, pineapple, mango, and peaches are delicious to eat frozen right out of the bag or can be added to your favorite smoothie recipe.Having the right condiments and seasonings on hand can help you prepare tasty and healthy mealswithout added fat and sodium.Be sure to stock your pantry with low-sodium chicken and vegetable broth, claim juice, canned tomatoes and tomato paste, marinara sauce (no sugar added), light coconut milk (for soups and curries), low-sodium soy sauce, dijon mustard dry white wine, balsamic vinegar, fresh garlic and ginger, and a variety of dried herbs and spices (e.g., Italian blend, curry powder, chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, no-salt/no-MSG mixed herb seasoning).Source: http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/make-over-your-grocery-listCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

On Sunday, search crews found Hagan’s hunting partner, 51-year-old Adrian Knopps of Grand Ledge, Mich., and transported him to Ketchikan for hypothermia treatment.More than a week ago, the two hunters left on the 44-foot vessel Abundance to hunt. Knopps reported that he last saw Hagan on Sep. 15 when he departed, with fresh game, in a seven-foot skiff to the fishing vessel Abundance near the mouth of Chickamin River off Behm Canal, according to the Coast Guard.On Sunday morning, a crew from the cruise vessel Wilderness Adventure spotted the Abundance adrift near Saks Cove.The Coast Guard found the hunter's kayak before the search was suspended.According to the Coast Guard, multiple aerial and sea crews along with Good Samaritans and family members spent more than 73 hours searching for Hagan and covered more than 514 square miles in the vicinity of Behm Canal from Sunday morning to Tuesday evening.“Suspending a case is one of the hardest decisions that we as search and rescuers have to make and our thoughts and prayers are with the family,” said Cmdr.

He says Alaska State Troopers are scheduled to arrive in Hoonah Thursday afternoon, and that the injured man has been flown out.“He was medevaced this morning and was in stable condition, as far as I know,” Rowley said.According to Rowley, while Hoonah periodically experiences bear maulings, the timing of Wednesday’s attack in the season is unusual.“It’s been a while since we’ve had one,” Rowley said. “This is a little early to have bears in our community; usually they’re still out fishing.”Rowley says it’s not yet clear what’s drawing the sow into town, but officers plan to address the matter.“There’s an issue, with this bear being in the community, and we need to find out what it is,” Rowley said.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

With so much conflicting information on necessity and quality, it’s hard to determine what’s right for my son and what’s gratuitous. Interestingly enough, new findings were revealed this week that help make my decision easier: over one-third of American children aren’t meeting calcium and vitamin D recommendations.In fact, calcium and vitamin D intakes were low for all children, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements who released the surprising data this week in the Journal of Pediatrics. Taylor Wallace, PhD, and senior director at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the data is “eye-opening because calcium and vitamin D deficiency is not only important in elderly women but a large segment of children are not getting enough.”  The data also revealed that non-supplement user children had a much higher incidence of insufficient intakes of calcium, vitamins A and C, magnesium and phosphorus when compared to supplement user children.So how can we help our children meet their calcium and vitamin D daily recommendations? Two ways: we can addfoods high in calcium and vitamin Dto their diet and we can give them clinically-tested, high-quality supplements that contain the right amount of daily nutrients. Foods high in calcium include spinach, kale, soybeans, and foods that are calcium-fortified like orange juice and breakfast cereal. Good sources for vitamin D include fatty fish (like tuna and salmon), cheese, and egg yolks.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/news/surprising-data-reveals-vitamin-deficiency-in-over-one-third-of-american-children-todays-newsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Get tips on how to keep it blooming all year.<COL>iStock/marilynaBy Chaya Kurtz,NetworxPoinsettias are a well-loved variety of houseplant. Their gracious (but bold) red and green leaves flourish in foil-covered pots in places public and private, augmenting the holiday spirit.  Rumored to be poisonous (they’re not), and originating in the exotic Mexican state Morelos, they are simultaneously a plant of intrigue and a common sight. These six facts about poinsettias will help you to appreciate and enjoy your poinsettia for years to come. (It can bloom for more than one season!)1. The red blooms of the poinsettia are bracts, not flowers.According to theUniversity of Illinois Extension, the showy red blooms of the poinsettia are not flowers. They are modified leaves, otherwise known as “bracts”. The flowers of a poinsettia plant are the small yellow flowers in the center of the bracts. According toIowa State University Extension and Outreach, the colorful bracts drop off of the plant after the flowers have shed their pollen. For plants that are in bloom longer, select a plant whose flowers show little or no yellow pollen.2. Poinsettias are available in over 100 colors.While a shade called “Prestige Red” is one of the most-bought cultivars of poinsettia, don’t feel limited to the classic green and red leaved look. According to the University of Illinois Extension, over 100 colors of poinsettia are available. Should you desire a bit of variety, poinsettias are also cultivated with bracts in shades of white, salmon, gold, cream, pink and burgundy.3. Contrary to popular belief, poinsettias are not poisonous.According to theColorado State University Extension, 1971 research at Ohio State University proved poinsettias were only poisonous to rats when the rats ate 500 branches or leaves. However, they are not meant for human or animal consumption. Poinsettias contain a sap that is irritating to animals and to people with latex allergies. Dogs or cats that eat poinsettia leaves or stalks have been known to cough or vomit, though the plants are not fatal to them. Since dogs will often taste new objects in their surroundings, it is best to place poinsettias in places where dogs cannot reach them.4. Poinsettias like cooler temperatures, but not too cold.The experts atOhio State University Extensionsuggest keeping your poinsettia at 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, and at a slightly cooler temperature at night. These optimal temperatures promote longer blooming. To avoid leaf drop, keep the poinsettia away from heat sources and drafts.5. Moderation is the key when watering a poinsettia.Only water a poinsettia when its soil is dry to the touch. How much water should you add to the pot? Horticulturists from theClemson University Cooperative Extension Servicesuggest watering until water seeps out the bottom of the drainage holes. Be sure to remove the foil that often covers drainage holes if you have just purchased a poinsettia. Although poinsettias do not like to dry out, they also do not like to sit in water. Empty the water that accumulates in the drip pan that holds the pot.6. It’s not only possible, but also easy, to reflower a poinsettia year after year.The Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Servicepublished a fantastic, simple chart that details how to make a poinsettia reflower. Simply, in March, remove the flower and cut stems to 6 inches. In June, repot the plant in a larger pot. Then plant it (in the pot) outside. In July, pinch off the lateral shoots. In late August, take the plant inside. From Sept. 20 to Dec. 1, keep your poinsettia in light from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. only. Keep it in darkness from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. This will cause the poinsettia to flower by Christmas.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/six-facts-about-poinsettiasDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The answer seems to change from day to day, as medical research uncovers new compounds that may be cancer protective and at the same time concludes that others haven't lived up to their cancer reducing potential. Here's the latest on three that show lots of promise for fighting cancer.Vitamin D: Defense Against Cancer and TumorsEvidence has been mounting thatvitamin Dmay protect against (or increase survival rates if you have)breast cancer, as well as cancers of the rectum, ovary, prostate, stomach,bladder, esophagus,kidney, lung, pancreas, and uterus, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Recently, researchers uncovered one function of vitamin D that may help explain its anti-tumor talents: In the presence of thisvitamin, tumor-suppressing compounds in cells that are normally shut off when a cancer develops keep on functioning.Many experts recommendsupplementsas the best source of vitamin D. Why? Very few foods provide it -- they include canned salmon, sardines, and fortified milk and orange juice. Vitamin D is also produced in yourskinduring exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays. But we're getting less sun exposure, in our efforts to reduce risk for skin cancer. Researchers estimate that one billion people around the world are low on vitamin D, including half of all menopausal women and at least 40 percent of elderly women and men. The recommended daily allowance for D was recently increased to 600 International Units for adults up toage70, 800 IU thereafter; the safe upper limit is 4,000 IU per day.Resveratrol: Reduce Cancer Risk, Slow DiseaseResveratrolhas been found to block the growth of tumor cells in cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, and thyroid. And in other lab studies, thisantioxidantslowed the development of cancers of the esophagus and intestines too. The truly amazing part: Resveratrol has been shown to put the brakes on all stages of cancer -- from DNA damage in cells to when cancerous cells begin to invade surrounding healthy tissue and spread. To find resveratrol, look to red wine,grapes,raspberries,peanuts, and supplements.Lycopene: Help to Prevent Prostate CancerCould this compound, also found in abundance in cookedtomatoproducts like spaghetti sauce, save your prostate? Truth is, research has yielded mixed results. But according to the American Cancer Society, some studies have found that men who get lots oflycopeneseem to have lower risk for this common male cancer. Others haven't found a link -- perhaps because not all men carry a fortunate genetic variation called XRCC1 that helps fix DNA damage.So while the research continues, some nutrients already shine in the war against cancer. Take advantage.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/prevention/cancer-prevention/cancer-prevention-the-latest-on-promising-supplementsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Right: Blunt in "Looper."Awards season is back in full swing, and not surprisingly acclaimed actress Emily Blunt's name is back in the mix. The great thing is, the two different roles she's receiving accolades for couldn't be any further apart, creatively.Blunt has a busy week in store, first with the Critics Choice Movie Awards Thursday for her nomination for Best Actress in an Action Movie for the sci-fi thriller "Looper"; and again on Sunday with the Golden Globes for her nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for the romantic dramedy "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."In an interview last week, Blunt told me that she was pleasantly surprised by both nominations -- and especially the latter since it's been nine months since the film was released in theaters. In fact, Blunt said that she and her fellow "Salmon Fishing" star never honestly expected the independent film would find the audience that it did."When I signed onto it, Ewan McGregor and I talked about how we loved the script -- how it was so charming, original and rare, and we looked at each other and laughed, saying, 'Nobody is going to see this movie!'" Blunt recalled for me with a giggle. "So we were blown away when it made as much money as it did because it was made for nothing, and it's the kind of movie people have seen a couple of times. It's the film people talked to me about most this year and that just thrills me beyond belief."Blunt added that it's just proof that, when it comes down to it -- all films are on equal footing when it comes to the quality of script. In the case of "Salmon Fishing," it tells the story of a fisheries expert (McGregor) who is approached by a consultant (Blunt) to a visionary sheik (Amr Waked) who wants to bring the sport of fly-fishing to the desert -- and something unexpected and inspirational happens in the process."It's just lovely when small films like this find a home, and it re-instills my faith in people just looking for a great story amongst all of the aliens, explosions and special effects," Blunt added. "What they're getting is a good story and something that makes your heart skip a beat. That's what I love about 'Salmon Fishing.'"Even better, the Golden Globe nomination increases the visibility for a film that will no doubt attract new audiences that it might not have otherwise -- a film that Blunt says has a rare, mystical quality about it."It is lovely when you get awards recognition for a film that needs a little helping hand like 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' -- small movies like this one with the clunkiest title in the world," Blunt said, laughing.  "So I'm really grateful for the Hollywood Foreign Press for this -- I'm so proud to be in it and am so glad that everybody enjoys it. There's something special about it that you can't quite put your finger on. I love that inability of trying to put your finger on what it is."After playing a charming romantic in "Salmon Fishing," Blunt said she was in "hook, line and sinker" for her role as one tough mother -- quite literally -- as the no-nonsense protector of her young son with a chilling secret in writer-director Rian Johnson's futuristic thriller "Looper."Just released on DVD and Blu-ray, "Looper" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe, a hit man in a future where time travel is possible. Known as "Loopers," hit men like Joe are assigned to assassinate targets sent back by mobsters from 30 years in the future to effectively "close the loop." But when the older version of Joe (Bruce Willis) is sent back and escapes young Joe's hit, a mind-bending trek leads to a Kansas farm owned by Sara (Blunt).Blunt's work on "Looper" signaled the second time in three years she's worked on a science fiction film, a funny coincidence since she has no inner sci-fi geek to fuel the desire to seek out work in the genre."I didn't really grow up watching sci-fi films, and only recently I saw 'Alien,' which I know is blasphemous, admitting that I've only recently watched it," said Blunt, 29. "But I seem to be drawn to these sci-fi-esque movies. I did 'Adjustment Bureau' and then 'Looper,' and now I'm doing this movie with (director) Doug Liman called 'All You Need is Kill,' with Tom Cruise."And now that Blunt is in the sci-fi loop, so to speak, she can't get enough of it."I think the thing that I love about all these sci-fi films is that it offers an altered and heightened backdrop for these characters to interact," Blunt observed. "I think that's really exciting as an actor, because you really get to play make believe and you get to stretch yourself, because it goes really beyond what you've normally experienced as a human being."Blunt said the great part about doing sci-fi films is that human characters and emotions can indeed co-exist among the fantastical premises. For "Looper," in fact, while Sara wears tough armor on the outside, at her core is a compassionate mother who will stop at nothing to protect a child that she regretfully once abandoned.Those sorts of characters -- and emotional arcs -- are few and far-between, she said."You never do come about, and that's why you sprint through the streets of New York to meet with Rian Johnson," Blunt said enthusiastically. "Emotionally, she was really complex and really hard to work out, and that's what I think people are really like in real life. People aren't just one thing. She's not just tough and she's not just feeling guilty. She's not just one thing. She's all of them. She's tough because she's feeling guilty. There are so many layers to this character."As for her immediate prospects of getting an award for "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen" or  "Looper," or any other future nominations that may come in her promising career, Blunt said in a way she already feels like a winner knowing that she's doing what she loves for a living."To be honest, awards are very flattering, but the fact that I'm even able to work in the business that often crushes people, the fact that I'm even able to work and do satisfying and fulfilling, creative jobs, is truly the thing I hold dearest to me -- not the accolades or anything else," Blunt said. "I hope awards recognition means business is good, and that means more business. That's all I hope for."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Kids have fun singing about these obvious anatomical relationships, but sometimes the connections between body parts are more surprising. Here's how to use your mouth to keep yourhearthealthy.Make your dessert dark chocolate.Yes, we're giving you permission to eat candy. Dark chocolate is packed with heart-friendlyantioxidants. It may also lower levels of bad LDL cholesterol and help raise levels of good HDL cholesterol. One more thing: Chemicals in dark chocolate help reduce blood clotting and increase blood-vessel flexibility, decreasing the chance of a heart attack. But don't go crazy -- all you need to get the benefits without too much fat is one half ounce daily. Make sure it contains at least 70 percentcocoa(it'll say on the label).Take care of your teeth.Columbia University doctors have found that people whose mouths contain a high number of the bacteria that cause gum disease are more likely to have plaque-clogged arteries. To protect yourteeth(and heart), brush twice a day, floss once a day, and swish your mouth out with an antimicrobial rinse. Don't forget to see your dentist for a checkup and cleaning twice a year.Go fishing.Loaded with omega-3s that help prevent cardiovascular disease,fish oillowers triglycerides, wards off artery-clogging plaque, and keeps blood pressure low. If you eat one or two servings of fatty fish (such as salmon, herring, or mackerel) each week, you're getting enoughfish oilto benefit your heart. If not, you'll benefit from asupplement.Engage in healthy venting.In a National Institutes of Health study, men who internalized their anger were more likely to suffer hardened arteries and high blood pressure than those who vented. It's a fatal chain reaction: Being perpetually angry increasesstresshormones, which boosts blood pressure and damages arterial walls.Butt out.Putting a cigarette to your lips can do more than just make your breath smelly. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers suffer heart attacks twice as much.Limit the drinks.Men who have more than two drinks a day have an increased risk of heart disease. For women, the risk escalates by consuming more than one a day. Those who binge drink are in an even higher risk group.Pass on the salt.There's a simple equation: The more salt you eat, the shorter your life, according to researchers at the University of Helsinki. They reviewed more than a dozen studies and found that people who reduced their sodium intake by 30 percent lived an average of seven years longer than those whose sodium intake remained high. Salt increases blood pressure and causes your body to retain water, which makes your heart work lots harder than it should. Still need that salty flavor? Create a mixture that's 65 percent table salt, 25 percent Morton Salt Substitute (potassiumchloride), and 10 percent Epsom. You won't taste the difference, but your heart will thank you.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/prevention/heart-disease/the-connection-between-your-heart-and-mouthDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Take meat and gluten, for starters. Gluten is a protein found in foods such aswheat, rye andbarley. In one study in the journalArthritis Research & Therapy, a diet without meat and gluten helped reduceinflammationassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. The diet also improved cholesterol levels, which can affectheart healthin people with this condition.Most experts say it's too soon to know if eating a certain way could reduce symptoms.  Even though studies don't favor a specific special diet, eating healthy can help you stay in shape and maybe even feel better.To eat right with rheumatoid arthritis:What if painfuljointsmake preparing food difficult? Try cooking in bigger batches, so you can reheat a meal the next day. Use utensils with padded handles, which are easier to grip. Or look for crock-pot recipes that are simple and only take one pot.For more tips onhealthy eatingwith rheumatoid arthritis, visit the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal andSkinDiseases Web site atwww.niams.nih.gov.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/joint-tissue-health/nutrition-to-help-ease-rheumatoid-arthritisDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Replace junk food with these staples and try some of my tips for choosing healthier options at the grocery store.Fill your fridge with the colors of the rainbow.You really can’t go wrong with any fresh fruits or vegetables, just make sure that you choose a variety of these nutrient-rich plant foods daily and make them a part of every meal and snack. Some of my top superfood picks include: spinach, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, kale, oranges, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and squash. While it’s fine to stock up on your favorites, consider trying a new food from the produce section every week. Not only will you improve your nutrient intake this way, but you’ll expand your taste buds too!Whole grains should get first dibs in your pantry to help maximize your weight loss efforts.Researchers have shown that women who eat more whole grains consistently weigh less than those who eat less of these fiber-rich foods. The great thing about whole grains is they can last a long time in your pantry, so stock up. Be sure you choose “whole” rather than refined grains, and avoid the processed versions, which typically have much of the nutrition stripped away–not to mention added salt, sugar, and preservatives. Think rolled oats, brown and wild rice, quinoa, ready-to-eat high-fiber cereals, and 100% whole grain breads and pasta.Make protein packed foods a kitchen staple.Fill your fridge and pantry with poultry, fish, shellfish (e.g., shrimp and scallops), eggs, non-fat milk and greek yogurt, low-fat cheese, soymilk, tofu, beans and lentils (dried and/or canned), nuts/seeds, and nut butters. If you include protein-rich foods as a part of every meal and snack you will stay satisfied, eat less, and lose weight faster than if you skimped on the protein.It’s easy to sabotage your weight loss efforts if you aren’t careful with your fat intake.Fat is one of those tricky components of any weight loss endeavor because it contains more calories per gram than protein and carbs. In other words, a little fat goes a long way. First off, don’t buy the fat-laden sweets and snacks like pastries, chips, processed meats (e.g., bacon, sausage, and hot dogs), butter and full-fat dairy (e.g., whole milk, ice cream). If they aren’t in your house, you are less likely to eat them. Instead choose healthy fats from foods like salmon and tuna (fresh and canned in water), nuts/seeds, nut butters, avocado, and olive oil. Importantly, eating fewer saturated fats and choosing more unsaturated and essential fats can shift your body’s fat-burning mechanisms into high gear.Beverages can make or break your weight loss efforts.If you’re drinking sodas, Frappuccinos, lattes, and sweetened juice or energy drinks everyday, you could easily add more than 20 pounds to your body weight every year–from these liquids alone. Even if you’re exercising on a regular basis, consuming these high-calorie beverages means you’ll have to work extra hard to burn off these empty calories. Stick primarily to water, but mix it up with green tea and coffee (sweetened with a natural, no-calorie sweetener such as stevia if desired), non-fat milk or soymilk. For a special treat, try seltzer water with a splash of 100% fruit juice and a lemon, lime, or orange slice for extra zing.Wondering if you should forever avoid the snack aisle? Of course not!While processed snack foods can easily increase your daily calorie intake, if you are careful with portion sizes and make wise choices, then indulging in a healthy treat makes sense. Think 100 percent fruit sorbet, popcorn, trail mix, dried fruit (e.g., raisins, figs, dates), dark chocolate, non-fat frozen yogurt, and high-fiber muffins. Be sure to pair your snack with some produce and/or protein for staying power. For example, an apple and high fiber muffin.Don’t forget about freezer basics.Frozen fruits and vegetables provide a nourishing alternative to fresh produce and can help you prepare a healthy meal or snack when you’re in a pinch. Edamame (soybeans in the pod), peas, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, corn, and veggie stir-fry combos go from the freezer to plate in no time. Berries, pineapple, mango, and peaches are delicious to eat frozen right out of the bag or can be added to your favorite smoothie recipe.Having the right condiments and seasonings on hand can help you prepare tasty and healthy mealswithout added fat and sodium.Be sure to stock your pantry with low-sodium chicken and vegetable broth, claim juice, canned tomatoes and tomato paste, marinara sauce (no sugar added), light coconut milk (for soups and curries), low-sodium soy sauce, dijon mustard dry white wine, balsamic vinegar, fresh garlic and ginger, and a variety of dried herbs and spices (e.g., Italian blend, curry powder, chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, no-salt/no-MSG mixed herb seasoning).Source: http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/make-over-your-grocery-listCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

Bob Herron (D-Bethel).Herron and Anchorage Senator Lesil McGuire (R-Anchorage) chair the commission.  They say deep water ports are vital to handle the increased maritime traffic, along with the ability to conduct search and rescue and environmental disaster response."In 2007 when the Northwest Passage opened for the first time, cruise ships visited Point Hope, without anyone there to clear people through customs, and came on land and started picking up artifacts," said McGuire.Though technically not located in the arctic, Unalaska was chosen for the conference because it's home to an anchor system which can bring in a vessel that's astray or without power and the community ranks as one of the world's largest fisheries, which Herron says will only grow if ships can gain access to the top of the world."People don't realize for the fishing business, in a different way this is like Prudhoe Bay, it's big it's industrial, it provides many jobs," said Herron.It’s too early to say if and when these projections of an arctic boom will come to fruition, but policy members say when it happens they want the state to be ready, and Alaskans to benefit.Contact Adam PinskerCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

These trees all have beautiful bark.<COL>iStock/AgenturfotografBy Erica Glasener,NetworxI look forward to every season in the garden and to the unique charms and qualities that each has to offer.Whether peeling, patchy, colorful, shiny or dull, bark is an asset.  When you plant trees with ornamental bark think about siting them against a backdrop ofevergreens or coniferswhich will help to show off their bark, especially in winter.  Including one or more trees with showy bark in your garden will help towardscreating a landscapewith year-around interest.Below is a list of trees with noteworthy bark.  All are good choices for specimens or focal points in the landscape.  Most become more ornamental as they mature over time.  Some like river birch,Betula nigra‘Heritage’, can get quite large and require lots of room to grow.  A blend of colors, their colorful peeling bark can be easily appreciated from a distance or up close.18 Bark Beauties1. Trident maple:(Acer buergerianum) This tree has scaly, exfoliating bark that gets more ornamental with age, in gray, orange and brown.  Zones 5 to 8.2. Paperbark maple:(Acer griseum) This one has peeling cinnamon bark.  Zones 4 to 8.3.

(I am living, expanding proof that this is true right now.) Eat lots of protein and hit the gym, and that pinch of fat will slowly get whittled away. It turns out, when it comes to cancer, the phrase “you are what you eat” may be a key factor in prevention.Does eating well guarantee protection against the C word? Sadly, no … but diet is thought to be a factor in30 to 40 percent of all cancers, along with genetic and environmental factors. At this point, you can’t do anything about the genes you were born with, but diet (along with other lifestyle factors like exercise)isa factor you can control. You don’t have to change every element of your diet or give up your favorites (just practice moderation), but you can make healthful changes that will have a big impact on your cancer risk.Here are a few areas to focus on -- consider it food for thought.Go RawA cancer-prevention habit almost all doctors can agree isfruits and veggies-- more of these means reducing your risk of all types of cancer. Not sure where to focus? Think crunchy green vegetables -- like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale, as well as cauliflower and spinach. If you’re looking to mix up a salad, add in tomatoes, red peppers, and kidney beans or chickpeas for an added boost. When it comes to fruit, blueberries and grapes are your best cancer-prevention friends.Don’t Skimp on FlavorPump up the flavor in home-cooked dishes, particularly if it’s coming from garlic, onion, chives, or leeks. These plants are all part of the allium family -- several studies have shown that increased consumption of garlic in particular led to a decreasedrisk of certain cancers. So go ahead, and load up your next meal with a these flavorful ingredients -- they have benefits both raw and cooked. Just maybe stock up on breath mints, too (or choose an odorlessgarlic supplement.)Think WholeWhen it comes to the carbs you put on your plate, choose wisely -- eating whole grains instead of refined grains offers a host of benefits, including fiber, anti-oxidants, minerals, B vitamins, and healthy fats. Even better,whole grains may be cancer fighters, against colorectal cancer in particular. To get the benefits, select whole grain bread instead of white bread, brown rice over white, or barley or oatmeal for breakfast. Popcorn is also a whole grain treat … assuming you enjoy it in its raw form and not slathered in hard-to-resist movie-theater butter.Chew the Fat (Wisely)We all know fat is bad … but sometimes we forget that some fats are good. The best among them are the omega-3 fatty acids, which studies have suggested may have potential in suppressing both the formation and thegrowth of certain cancers. If you’re looking for specific foods to focus on, think fish like salmon, halibut, tuna, cod, and striped bass, as well as flaxseeds and soybeans. If you’re like me and you hate the taste of fish, you can take afish oil supplementto get the benefits instead.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/can-changing-your-diet-lower-your-cancer-riskDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Agood night’s sleepand regularexerciseare vital for keeping the mind focused and alert, but diet plays an important role, too. If you or your kids are heading into the classroom every day -- or if you just want to perform better at work or in general -- incorporate these eight kid-friendly foods into your daily diet rotation:WalnutsOmega-3 fatty acids are important for healthy brain function and memory. If you’ve ever read anything about nutrition, you know that salmon is a great source, but good luck trying to get your kid to eat salmon for lunch. Walnuts are also chock-full of omega-3s, and they come with a lot less nose-wrinkling and complaints.OatmealThe studies are in -- breakfast reallyisthemost important meal of the day. Studies have shown that students who eat before hitting the classroom consistently perform better than those who don’t. And there’s no better morning superstar than oatmeal. These whole grains contain vitamin B6, which is essential for enhancing short-term memory and attention span.AlmondsTrue story: I woke up in a daze this morning, and two cups of coffee didn’t improve the situation. You know what did? A serving of almonds. These nuts helps fight brain fog so you can focus on the task at hand (in my case, writing about brain foods for Pure Matters). As an added bonus, they also improve mood, making them a great snack choice for moody teenagers who can’t focus because they have So. Many. Feelings.AvocadosIf your blood flow is hindered, your brain can’t do all of the things it needs to do. The good fats in avocado keep everything moving along, ensuring that you’re awake, alert and focused. I didn’t need another reason to eat guacamole every chance I get, but I’m happy to have one.BlueberriesAll berries fall into the superfood category, and with good reason. High in fiber, full of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory… the list goes on and on. I’d hate to malign strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, but it seems that blueberries are just a little bit more super, especially when it comes to improving your memory.Flax SeedsI am a firm believer that just about everyone needs flax seeds in their lives. They keep your cardiovascular system humming along; they help fight cancer and chronic inflammation; and they can do wonders for your digestion. On the brain front, they keep your mind sharp by helping the cerebral cortex process information. And while kids may turn their noses up at the mention of flax seeds, they are easy to grind up and sneak into smoothies, yogurt, cereals and baked goods. I won’t tell if you don’t.EggsEggs are one of the best sources of choline, an amino acid which is an important nutrient for memory and learning. The choline is in the yolk, though, so if you’re one of those people who asks for egg whites, you’re missing out on an important brain food, not to mention all of the egg’s antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins.YogurtCalcium helps nerve function, which is essential for a healthy brain. Yogurt is one of the best ways to get this nutrient, both due to the good bacteria it contains, and the amino acids which help improve alertness and memory.Kid-Friendly Meal IdeasBreakfast:Lunch:Snacks:Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Although you can takesupplementsthat provide calcium and vitamin D, the best way to get adequate calcium is by eating calcium-rich foods. The best way to get vitamin D is to expose your face, arms, hands or back (without sunscreen) to the sun for 10 to 15 minutes at least two times per week.One in every two women and one in four men older than 50 will have a bone fracture caused by weak bones in their lifetime. Fortunately, following a healthy-bones diet can bolster bone strength and reduce the risk for osteoporosis."Calcium is needed for several essential bodily functions, and if you don't consume enough, your body will steal from your bones to get it," says Roberta Anding, M.S., RD/LD, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.Adults ages 19 to 50 need about 1,000 mg of calcium and 400-800 IU vitamin D a day to protect their bones, help control high blood pressure and maintainheartandmuscle health. Adults ages 51 and older need about 1,200 mg of calcium and 800-1000 IU of vitamin D a day. Although 1,000 mg of calcium a day is not difficult to get -- three daily servings of dairy products will do it -- nine out of 10 women get less than the recommended intake, with most getting less than half of what they should."The best way to get calcium is through your diet," says Ms. Anding. "High-calcium foods -- milk, cheese, salmon with bones and kale, for example -- are major assets in building bone strength."Other dairy products made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are usually not fortified with vitamin D and contain only small amounts. If you have only limited exposure to sun because of climate or you can’t get outdoors, be sure to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet or take vitamin D supplements.These additional recommendations can strengthen your bones:Avoid excess sodium, which increases the amount of calcium released from the body.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/bone-health/the-healthy-bones-dietDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Why? Very few foods provide it -- they include canned salmon, sardines, and fortified milk and orange juice. Vitamin D is also produced in yourskinduring exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays. But we're getting less sun exposure, in our efforts to reduce risk for skin cancer. Researchers estimate that one billion people around the world are low on vitamin D, including half of all menopausal women and at least 40 percent of elderly women and men. The recommended daily allowance for D was recently increased to 600 International Units for adults up toage70, 800 IU thereafter; the safe upper limit is 4,000 IU per day.Resveratrol: Reduce Cancer Risk, Slow DiseaseResveratrolhas been found to block the growth of tumor cells in cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, and thyroid.

Our bodies need calcium to maintain healthy bones and teeth as well as to help muscles and nerves to carry messages between the brain and other body parts. Lots of us aren’t getting enough calcium regularly, which can lead to issues such as osteoporosis or risk of bone fractures in the long term, especially as we get older.Keep your bones and teeth healthy by exercising regularly, eating foods that contain calcium, and taking supplements. Calcium comes in a variety of food, including the following:Healthcare providers often recommend that adults, especially women, take calcium supplements regularly to maintain healthy bones. The amount that you need varies with age. Check out the National Institutes of Health’sOffice of Dietary Supplementsfor average recommended daily doses by age group.Calcium supplements may interfere with some medications, so make sure to check with your healthcare provider before starting a regular supplement plan.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/why-you-need-your-daily-dose-of-calciumDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Many fruits and vegetables containpotassiumandmagnesium.Avocados, bananas, and potatoes are especially rich in these nutrients. Legumes, nuts, dairy products, and whole grains also have potassium and magnesium. Not eating enough foods with these nutrients has been linked with poor lung function.Fruits and vegetables also containvitamin Cand a nutrient calledquercetin. Some experts believe that vitamin C may help treat allergy-related conditions like asthma. Quercetin, which slows the release of the chemical histamine, may also be helpful. Histamine in the body causesallergysymptoms.Consider eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, too. These foods include fresh fish (salmon, mackerel, and halibut) and plant oils (flaxseed oilandwalnuts). Omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce swelling and improve lung function in adults with asthma.It's not known for sure yet whether these dietary changes can improve your asthma, but it won't hurt to try them. Just be sure to continue taking your asthma medicine as directed.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/fight-asthma-with-the-right-nutritionDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

With so much conflicting information on necessity and quality, it’s hard to determine what’s right for my son and what’s gratuitous. Interestingly enough, new findings were revealed this week that help make my decision easier: over one-third of American children aren’t meeting calcium and vitamin D recommendations.In fact, calcium and vitamin D intakes were low for all children, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements who released the surprising data this week in the Journal of Pediatrics. Taylor Wallace, PhD, and senior director at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the data is “eye-opening because calcium and vitamin D deficiency is not only important in elderly women but a large segment of children are not getting enough.”  The data also revealed that non-supplement user children had a much higher incidence of insufficient intakes of calcium, vitamins A and C, magnesium and phosphorus when compared to supplement user children.So how can we help our children meet their calcium and vitamin D daily recommendations? Two ways: we can addfoods high in calcium and vitamin Dto their diet and we can give them clinically-tested, high-quality supplements that contain the right amount of daily nutrients. Foods high in calcium include spinach, kale, soybeans, and foods that are calcium-fortified like orange juice and breakfast cereal. Good sources for vitamin D include fatty fish (like tuna and salmon), cheese, and egg yolks.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/news/surprising-data-reveals-vitamin-deficiency-in-over-one-third-of-american-children-todays-newsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Or, “But you’re putting too much stress on your body!” And finally, “You need fiber! Fiber is necessary!” If you are both my friend and a fan of The Master Cleanse, juicing, etc., you have heard that refrain from me. A lot. I think cleansing is great for losing 10 pounds before that wedding your ex will be at, but for health? Meh. Detoxing is important, but there’s a better way.When we talk about detoxing the body, what we really mean is cleaning out the kidneys and liver. These organs filter out the toxic substances we come into contact every day, including those we purposefully ingest (alcohol, tobacco, chemicals in processed foods) and those that are we take in involuntarily (environmental toxins). Exposure to too many of those toxins can make those organs a little sluggish, which is why detoxing is important. Luckily, there are a ton offoodsthat will do that work for us.1. Cruciferous VegetablesBroccoli, cauliflower, kale, boy choy, Brussels sprouts and cabbage are superfoods for a lot of reasons -- fiber, antioxidants, anti-cancer properties -- but they’re also great for detoxing the liver.2. SpicesIf you’re a fan of spicy food, you’re in luck when it comes to detoxing. Cayenne, cinnamon and turmeric all help stimulate circulation anddigestion, which helps to keep the liver humming along.3. GarlicWhen it comes to detoxing, garlic is a powerhouse. It helps to stimulate both the kidneys and liver. It also has powerful antibiotic properties, so if your detox system is sluggish due to an illness, garlic can help support the healing process.4. GreensNext time you’re at the farmer’s market, load up on seasonal greens, like spinach, mustard greens and chard. The chlorophyll in leafy greens supports the liver, and is especially helpful for clearing out environmental toxins like pesticides and heavy metals.5. Berries and ApplesFruit has three things going for it when it comes to detoxing: high water content, easy digestibility, and fiber. When it comes to the latter, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and apples are superstars. Not only do they help the body flush out toxins, they also support liver functioning.6. LentilsWhen you’re trying to detox your body, the last thing you want to eat is digestion-unfriendly meat. But you still need protein. Enter lentils – these legumes are protein-and-fiber rich, which both help you to feel full and support the body’s detoxification process.7. Fresh Ginger RootLike garlic, ginger helps to support both the kidneys and liver. It stimulates digestion, which helps both organs remove toxins faster. Bonus: While your body is detoxing, you might experience some digestive discomfort. Make a tea by steeping grated ginger in boiling water to help alleviate symptoms.8. LemonsAll citrus fruits are good for detoxifying, but lemon is the absolute best. It helps to destroy harmful bacteria, supports the liver, and cleanses the blood. If you’re going through a detox phase, start each morning with a warm glass of water mixed with the juice of one lemon.9.Green TeaCommon sense dictates that when you’re trying to detox your body, you should avoid caffeine. And you should, for the most part. There’s an exception to every rule, and in this case, it’s green tea, which is loaded with antioxidants and supports the liver.10. Omega-3sEvery diet – detox or otherwise – needs healthy oils in it, andOmega-3sare by far the healthiest. Salmon, avocado, flaxseeds and walnuts are all rich sources of this vital nutrient, which supports your immune system, helps to clear out environmental toxins, and stimulates the liver.When it comes to eating these foods, raw or lightly steamed is best, so you don’t kill the nutrients.

The fatty acids have been shown to have many benefits, from heart health to joint health to brain health to eye health. What you may not realize is that within the family of omega-3s, there are actually three types of healthy fatty acids in play --  EPA, DHA, and ALA.EPA and DHA are commonly found in fatty fish like salmon, anchovies, and tuna, especially bluefin. You can also skip the fish and cover your bases by choosing to take anOmega-3 fish oil supplement, aDHA supplement, or akrill oil supplement. Chances are, you’ve heard all about the benefits and you’re already taking one of those (if you’re not, I highly recommend Koren’sprimer on the Omegas) -- but you may have overlooked the third fatty acid, ALA.When it comes to adding ALA to your routine, your best bet isflaxseed oil. You can try a supplement (likeFlax Seed Oil softgels from Pure Matters!), the true oil form, or flaxseeds themselves -- the options really are endless. You can use flaxseed oil as ahealthier alternative for cooking-- I’ve had good luck finding it in natural food stores, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. The seeds can be enjoyed whole (I like them in vanilla yogurt and on salads), but grinding them will give you the biggest nutritional benefits.Even better, since flaxseed oil is plant-based, it’s a great alternative to fish oils if you’re a strict vegetarian or vegan. (And if for some reason the idea of a flaxseed oil supplement or flaxseed in your diet doesn’t appeal to you, you can also try noshing on walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and leafy green vegetables for an extra dose of omegas.)How can flaxseed oil potentially benefit you and your health? By adding it to your daily vitamin and supplement routine, you could be getting the following healthy boosts:While still relatively untested, it’s also thought that flaxseed may have potential intreating some cancers, as well as diabetes, anxiety, and hot flashes. Given all the attention that’s being paid to the omegas, there’s no doubt new research will find new potential uses, too!Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/pure-popular-flaxseed-oil#more-1598Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

We slather on the sunscreen, wear hats and don UV-protective clothing. Meanwhile, our teeth and bones pay the price -- staying out of the sun means we don't activate production of our sunshine vitamin, vitamin D, which is critical to strong bones and pearly whites.In addition to our obsession with UV protection, numerous studies point to the fact that the Dietary Reference Intakes (RDIs) for vitamin D set in the 1990s are no longer sufficient based on new research that shows vitamin D wears more than a "calcium absorption" hat. It turns out that vitamin D could be a strong defensive player against cancer, heart disease, immunity and neuromuscular disorders. Based on this, you can bet that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has set determining the optimal intake of vitamin D as a high priority.Most Americans face a serious vitamin D deficiency, with women having the greatest risk of deficiency. Nearly half of us don't meet our recommended daily intake for vitamin D, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Dietetic Association.A lack of vitamin D in our diets has put us on a path toward some serious health problems. Studies show that a lack of vitamin D may put people at risk for diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis.Geography, age, skin color and the amount of SPF we apply plays a serious role in how much or how little vitamin D our bodies produce. Today, most vitamin D comes from the foods we eat. Fish is one of the few foods naturally rich in vitamin D. Tuna, salmon, sardines and mackerel are especially excellent sources of vitamin D, but it's unlikely that we're eating enough to make up for our vitamin D deficit. Products such as milk and yogurt, certain baked goods and oil spreads usually pack extra vitamin D, too.So, how much should be we be getting? Well, we won't know for sure until the IOM sets new recommendations. You can visit your doctor and request a blood test for the active form of vitamin D, known as 25 hydroxy D3. The amount of vitamin D needed to maintain optimal levels in our blood has not yet been established, but initial studies suggest the range to be a concentration somewhere between 40 and 80 nanomoles/liter. This test can be taken at your annual check-up to see how effective your diet is in providing you with vitamin D.In the meantime, eat the foods I've mentioned as being high in vitamin D. You can also supplement 200 IUs per day (if you're under 50 years of age) or 400 IUs a day (if you're over 50 years of age). Eating a LUNA bar is another great way to get vitamin D, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium and folic acid, that women need. Your bones, teeth and taste buds will thank you!Distributed by Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.No email address was supplied by.

There are some foods, however, that have earned the “heart-healthy” label by going above and beyond when it comes to keeping your body chugging along.Salmon has more omega-3s per serving than most people get in an entire day! These fatty acids decrease your risk of stroke, heart attack and high blood pressure. Just two servings of salmon per week can help keep your ticker ticking along. It’s important to make sure that you’re buying low-mercury salmon, though. The  Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) offers an up-to-the-minute guide to sustainable seafood and mercury levels in fishhere.Not a fish eater? Pick up some flaxseeds for the same omega-3 boost. You can buy the seeds whole or ground, and mix them into yogurt or smoothies, or sprinkle them on salads or cereal for a heart-healthy upgrade.When it comes to keeping your heart healthy, oats are a nutritional powerhouse. Loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, folate and potassium, these fiber-rich grains help to lower LDL, or “bad” cholesterol. To get the maximum benefit, opt for steel cut, not instant oats. Not only is real oatmeal better for you than the stuff in the packet, it’s also heartier and tastier.You’ve probably heard about how healthy the Mediterranean diet, and olive oil is one of its superstars. The oleic acid in this healthy oil is a monosaturated fat responsible for lowering bad cholesterol and blood pressure. Cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oil offers the most health benefits. Whip up an easy, tasty salad dressing by shaking up one part vinegar, three parts olive oil, sea salt, freshly ground pepper and your choice of herbs or spices.All tree nuts are good for your heart, but walnuts contain a higher amount of alpha-linolenic acid, which has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and improves a wide variety of cardiovascular function, most notably blood pressure. My favorite way to get more walnuts into my diet is to swap it in for pine nuts in homemade pesto. It even tastes better!Finally, an excuse to drink more red wine! Resveratrol, a polyphenol in red wine, helps to prevent damage to red blood cells and blood clots. The key is drinking in moderation, though, which means one 5-ounce glass per day for women, and 1-2 servings for men. Let’s all raise a glass to that.When it comes to antioxidants in food, blueberries are rock stars. The high levels of the free-radical-fighting nutrients in these berries helps to reduce bad cholesterol and raise HDL, the “good” cholesterol, and it helps to protect your blood vessels. Healthiest breakfast ever? Oatmeal topped with flaxseed and blueberries. Have it tomorrow morning -- your heart will thank you.Black beans are loaded with soluble fiber, which helps to lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks. They also contain phytonutrients, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Tip: Buy dried black beans and soak them overnight before cooking. They retain more nutrients that way, plus they’re easier on the wallet and the digestive tract.Spinach is one of those superfoods that we should all be eating, all the time anyway, but it’s especially good for the heart due to its peptide content. Peptides lower blood pressure and keep blood vessels healthy, which reduces the risk of atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. For a double dose of heart support, toss spinach leaves with a homemade olive oil dressing or sauté spinach in olive oil.When it comes to heart health, soy is a controversial topic. The general consensus seems to be that whole soybeans -- rather than tofu, tempeh or other processed soy products -- offer the most cardiovascular support, though. So keep a bag of edamame in the freezer for a filling, healthy snack.Want to reduce your risk of dying from any disease? Sip on some green tea. The high amount of polyphenols in green tea protect against heart disease, lower the risk of stroke, and save arteries from free radical damage. Some studies even show that drinking green tea all day is even better than drinking water, so brew up a big batch of regular or decaf and drink to your health.No email address was supplied by.

That means eating enough food each day and making healthy food choices. However, some research indicates that girls' caloric intake appears low for their activity levels.Female teenage athletes are encouraged to get 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 15 percent from protein and 25 percent from fat. But telling your teen that might not make a difference-- Most teens' nutrition know-how doesn't affect their diet. Many female athletes are afraid to gain weight, so they undereat despite their high activity levels. Parents and coaches can help active teens by encouraging healthy eating.The Weight-control Information Network (WIN) offers these tips to keep teenage athletes healthy:- Pay attention to food choices and serving sizes. Choosing healthy foods in appropriate portions will supply adequate nutrients for teenagers. For example, one healthy food choice for teens is six one-ounce servings of grains every day, like whole-grain cereal.- Provide protein. Protein repairs body tissue and builds muscles. Teens typically need five and a half one-ounce servings a day. Very active teens might need more. Lean meat, beans, tofu, eggs, veggie burgers and nuts and nut butters all provide protein.- Pack some iron in your teen's lunch. Iron replenishes the body, so it's especially important for teen girls. Try eating seafood, lean beef, legumes, spinach and fortified cereals and breads.- Make sure your teen eats healthy fats. A low-fat diet isn't necessarily healthy. Fat is an important nutrient that helps the body grow and develop properly. It also serves as a source of energy, but be aware that some fats are better than others. Instead of saturated and trans fats, aim to provide 25 to 35 percent of her calories in the form of healthy fat. Unsaturated fat can be found in olive, canola, safflower, corn and soybean oils, avocados, salmon, whitefish, trout, tuna and tree nuts, such as almonds and walnuts.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Served with fried onions and pita croutons, it’s a great main course. Red lentils don’t retain their lovely salmon color when cooked, but still, they're delicious. Take care not to overcook them; they should be tender, but not mushy.For the soup2 tablespoons olive oil2 cups finely chopped onion3 cloves garlic, minced1 teaspoon ground cumin1 teaspoon ground coriander8 cups vegetable or chicken stock, divided (make stock from cubes, concentrate, or powder)1 ¾ cups dried red lentils2 carrots, finely chopped½ cup coarsely chopped celery leavesPinch of red pepper flakes¼ cup fresh lemon juiceSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste2 tablespoons olive oil1 large onion, thinly sliced2 Mediterranean or Greek pitas, halved horizontally (see Tip)6 lemon wedgesHeat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and coriander; stir for about 30 seconds.Stir in 6 cups of the stock, lentils, carrots, celery leaves, and red pepper flakes. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 cups stock and the lemon juice. Season to taste.While the soup is cooking, prepare the garnishes. Adjust the oven broiler rack to 4 to 5 inches from the heating element; preheat the broiler. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.Place the pita halves on a baking sheet; toast under the broiler until crispy and light brown, about 2 minutes per side. Let cool, then break into 1-inch pieces.Top each serving with a mound of the cooked onion and sprinkle with the pita croutons; serve a lemon wedge on the side.VariationSubstitute brown lentils for the red lentils; increase the cooking time to about 35 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.Advance preparationThis soup will keep for up to 5 days in a covered container in the refrigerator. When reheating, stir in vegetable stock or water to thin as desired. Store the pita croutons for up to 5 days in a tightly covered tin at room temperature.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

And don’t use hot water.Limit yourself to one shower a day and keep it under 5 or 10 minutes. And fight the urge to pump up the heat. Hot water will strip away your natural moisturizing oils and dehydrate skin.Skip the soap (and the washcloth!)Use moisturizing cleansers in the shower instead of soap, which can be harsh on skin. And avoid scrub brushes, wash clothes, and sponges -- they can also damage your skin.Moisturize constantlyThe most important times to moisturize are after a shower, after you wash your hands and before you head outside. (It’s best to apply when skin is slightly damp.) Are your cuticles dry and hard? Try massaging in some olive oil.Lather on lip balmYour lips have substantially less oil glands than most parts of your body. This leads to more frequent cracking and sun damage. Make sure to wear lip balm with SPF every day -- rain or shine.Eat fishSome types of fish, like salmon and trout are high in an omega-3 fatty acid called DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which can help relieve itching and dryness. Don’t like fish? Walnuts are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.Invest in a humidifierFight dry winter air with a humidifier (or three.) Instead of sleeping in a room full of dry heat, add some moisture to the air with a humidifier. Added bonus: it’ll also help prevent your wood furniture from drying out!Don’t scratch!Yes, dry skin is itchy. But try to avoid scratching -- it just exacerbates the problem. Instead, apply moisturizer for instant albeit temporary relief.Washing your face twice a dayDon’t use a face wash in the morning. Just rinse with a little water and follow with good moisturizer.Drinking lots and lots of waterIt’s oil, not water that keeps skin moist. So while drinking eight glasses of water every day is a healthy choice, it’s not going to help prevent your skin from drying out unfortunately.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/healthy-body/dry-skin-guide-what-works-what-doesntCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

Make sure you have a plan,” Werner said. “As we know, we’ve got a lot of bad areas out here, [so] you got to pay attention to the tidal month and the way the tides are coming in.”Seward reported being out of breath and scared after the ordeal, but was uninjured.Contact Sarah EvansChannel 2's Chris Klint contributed to this story.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The men were identified as Dennis Monroe, 46, of Montesano, Wash., and John Reid, 44, of Sitka, and Fred Swenson, unknown age, of Montesando, Wash.“They ended up overshooting the bay and turning around,” Beth Ipsen, AST spokesperson, said in a statement. “The rough waters quickly swamped the drop bow style boat with water, causing it to sink.”“Monroe made it to the shore where he spent the night and flagged a boat down with a fishing flasher the next morning (Friday, Aug. 2),” Ipsen said.According to the USCG, the boat sank around 8 p.m. Thursday and the three men attempted to swim to shore wearing lifejackets. Monroe was picked by Good Samaritans from the beach at Cape Ommaney.After multiple air and water searches on Friday, Reid and Swenson were not found and their conditions were unknown."It's unfortunate that our first indication was a need for a search came the following morning," USCG Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Mooers said. "We definitely recommend that mariners take multiple forms of communication devices with them as well as a personal locator beacon as well."According to troopers, Reid’s body was found before 4 p.m. Saturday in open water seven miles offshore due west from the southern tip of Baranof Island. His body was to flown to Sitka where his identity was confirmed and his family was notified.The search crews included Coast Guard members from United States and Canada, a Coast Guard airplane, a cutter and a Jayhawk helicopter, and five Good Samaritan crews, according to USCG Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Mooers.The Coast Guard suspended the active search for Swenson on Saturday night after nearly 47 hours and covering more than 1,224 square miles in the vicinity of the island and Redfish Bay.Search crews dealt with weather conditions reportedly 12 to 23 mph winds and 4 to 6-foot seas with good visibility. According to the Coast Guard, the water temperature for Southeast Alaska in August is in the 50s.“Suspending a case is one of the hardest decisions that we as search and rescuers have to make and our thoughts and prayers are with the families,” said Scott Giard, a command duty officer with Coast Guard Sector Juneau. “We appreciate the support of our partner agencies and good Samaritans to put as many resources on scene as possible and maximize our chances of locating these boaters.”Editor's Note: KTUU's Samantha Angaiak contributed to this story.Contact Neil TorquianoCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Clemens, 56, is accused of assaulting the two deckhands, both 22-year-old Pennsylvania men, Monday night about 10 miles southeast of Kodiak.“At the time of the assault the vessel was commercial fishing in the waters off of Cape Chiniak,” troopers wrote. “Clemens was reportedly highly intoxicated. The two victims and a third crew member escaped by taking the seine skiff to Kodiak.”Troopers were informed of the assault at about 9 a.m. Tuesday, catching up with Clemens just before 11 a.m. at the St. Paul boat harbor to arrest him on two counts of fourth-degree domestic-violence assault and one count of operating under the influence.AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen didn't immediately have further details on the nature of the assault aboard the fishing vessel, or whether anyone was injured during the incident.Clemens has been remanded to the Kodiak City Jail. He is being held without bail until he is arraigned.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Unidirectional carbon fiber, a common carbon mesh, received a super-light lift in government labs, prompting its secret classification.But government insiders have hobbies, too. One man, whose name cannot be released, decided to work with Orvis, an outdoors supplier, to create the ultimate fly fishing rod. He learned that the military was using a new kind of composite, a carbon fiber woven to be strong in every direction, but with 25 percent less weight than normal carbon mesh.More exciting still, the new material weighs less than traditional fishing rods.The carbon mesh is light -- anglers can cast all day without tiring. Fly fishing proves a precise art -- small manipulations make big differences in how and where flies -- fake insects used as bait -- land on the water's surface. The carbon mesh allows anglers to control even the tiniest flies.When Orvis rolled a tube from unidirectional carbon fiber, it created a superior fishing rod that is more flexible, stronger, lighter and more precise than other fishing rods.Orvis calls its new creation the Helios. Early reviews have garnered raves. A 9-foot rod weighs only 2.1 ounces, making it easy to cast for long periods. The Helios is strong enough to pull in large catches, but it has enough give that a fighting fish won't break the line."This rod is significantly different -- and better," wrote Al Kyte, master fly caster and member of the Federation of Fly Fishers Casting Board of Governors. "It has an extremely light feel, takes surprisingly little effort to cast, is nicely progressive and is a true five-weight."No email address was supplied by.

Alan Brown, the deceased -- 23-year-old Pvt. Christopher Covington -- was one of three soldiers aboard the boat, along with Spcs. Columbus Jones Jr., 39, and George Brady, 23. Jones’ 11-year-old son, Columbus Jones III, was also aboard.Troopers were informed of the incident, which took place about eight miles upriver of the Klutina River boat launch, at about 10 a.m. Saturday.“The boat operator, (Jones Jr.) experienced mechanical problems and was unable to maneuver the vessel,” troopers wrote. “The fast river current pushed the vessel into a submerged rock and flipped the boat. Jones and his son…were able to cling to the boat for a short time before they were separated by the current.”Jones Jr. was able to reach the river’s shore on his own, while members of a fishing guide service were able to rescue Jones III from the river as well as Brady, who had been washed downstream but also reached shore. Covington, however, spent an undetermined amount of time in the water before he was found.“Covington continued downstream an unknown distance before he was pickup by a private jet boat,” troopers wrote. “Covington was not breathing when he was located and (the boat’s occupants) began CPR.”Covington was taken to Copper Center medics at the Klutina River boat launch and then to the Crossroads Medical Clinic, where he was declared dead.Troopers say all four occupants of the boat were wearing life jackets, and that alcohol is not believed to be a factor in the incident.AST spokesperson Megan Peters says the boat, owned by Fort Wainwright Outdoor Recreation, was rented to the men under the military’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation program, which offers a variety of outdoor gear. She didn’t immediately have further details beyond those listed in Monday’s dispatch.According to Brown, Covington was assigned to Fort Wainwright’s 1-52d Aviation Regiment. He says the Army is investigating the incident, which initially appears to be a simple boating accident.“We’re certainly looking into what happened, and we’ll be working with the Alaska State Troopers to get to the bottom of it,” Brown said.Brown expressed his condolences to Covington’s family and comrades, calling Saturday’s events tragic.“Any time we lose our brothers and sisters, it’s a terrible day,” Brown said.The state medical examiner’s office has requested Covington’s body for an autopsy. His next of kin have been notified by members of the military.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It is the traveler only who is foreign."If you have ever traveled to an exotic land with a language you do not speak, you know just how foreign and alien the language barrier can make you feel.Unfortunately, not understanding the local language can also steal from you one of the greatest joys of traveling: meeting new people and making friends from different cultures and backgrounds. So what can you do if you enjoy visiting exotic destinations, want a taste of the local culture, but don't have the time to learn the language of every country you visit on a two-week vacation?Simple. Find exotic destinations where the locals already speak English. Pure genius. Check out our list of five exotic destinations where, surprisingly, language will not be of a problem.First up: Dónde se habla Inglés en América Central?BelizeWelcome to Belize, the only English-speaking country in Central America.The country is home to stewed chicken with rice and beans, the red-footed booby bird, endless white sand beaches and the largest coral reef in the Western hemisphere. All of which makes it a natural destination for nature lovers, beach bums, snorkelers and scuba divers.Culture enthusiasts will enjoy Belize's 900-plus Mayan archaeological sites. If you visit only one Mayan ruin, make it the Mayan Pyramids of El Caracol. The view from the top of its 140-foot pyramid over an endless sea of emerald-green high-canopy jungle is something you will not forget in a hurry.However, maybe Belize is just not exotic enough for you. How about the farthest East country you can visit before you run into yesterday?Are you ready to time travel?KiribatiKiribati is the easternmost country in the world. Travel east from Kiribati and you will cross the International Date Line and run into yesterday. The official languages of Kiribati are English and Gilbertese.This isolated nation was untouched by foreign influences until the 18th century, when American and British ships first landed on its shores. Since then, Kiribati has established itself as a world-class destination for travelers looking for classic Pacific beaches, a tranquil and serene way of life, game fishing, surfing and World War II relics.However, if you are planning to visit Kiribati, don't waste time. Tragically, Kiribati is set to be the first country to disappear due to rising water levels caused by global warming.Our next destination takes us to one of the cradles of civilization where, happily for us, English is widely used.Have you got a safari hat handy?KenyaThe official motto of Kenya is Harambee, which in English means "all pull together."It is a fitting motto for a country consisting of more than 70 tribes that speak more than 30 languages and countless dialects. Fortunately for you, English is the official language along with Swahili, both of which are used as a trade language between the melting pot of cultures that make up Kenya.So, forget your phrase books and translation phone apps. Climb Mount Kenya, go on a safari, trek along the Rift Valley, visit a genuine Masai village or relax at one of Kenya's popular beach resorts without worrying (too much) about the language barrier.Our next stop takes us to South America. We know what you're thinking: an English-speaking country in South America?No email address was supplied by.

That means eating enough food each day and making healthy food choices. However, some research indicates that girls' caloric intake appears low for their activity levels.Female teenage athletes are encouraged to get 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 15 percent from protein and 25 percent from fat. But telling your teen that might not make a difference-- Most teens' nutrition know-how doesn't affect their diet. Many female athletes are afraid to gain weight, so they undereat despite their high activity levels. Parents and coaches can help active teens by encouraging healthy eating.The Weight-control Information Network (WIN) offers these tips to keep teenage athletes healthy:- Pay attention to food choices and serving sizes. Choosing healthy foods in appropriate portions will supply adequate nutrients for teenagers. For example, one healthy food choice for teens is six one-ounce servings of grains every day, like whole-grain cereal.- Provide protein. Protein repairs body tissue and builds muscles. Teens typically need five and a half one-ounce servings a day. Very active teens might need more. Lean meat, beans, tofu, eggs, veggie burgers and nuts and nut butters all provide protein.- Pack some iron in your teen's lunch. Iron replenishes the body, so it's especially important for teen girls. Try eating seafood, lean beef, legumes, spinach and fortified cereals and breads.- Make sure your teen eats healthy fats. A low-fat diet isn't necessarily healthy. Fat is an important nutrient that helps the body grow and develop properly. It also serves as a source of energy, but be aware that some fats are better than others. Instead of saturated and trans fats, aim to provide 25 to 35 percent of her calories in the form of healthy fat. Unsaturated fat can be found in olive, canola, safflower, corn and soybean oils, avocados, salmon, whitefish, trout, tuna and tree nuts, such as almonds and walnuts.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The high-fat, high-salt American diet is largely to blame: It's easier to eat junk than reaching for a healthy alternative.The deeper cause for heart disease is low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that delivers cholesterol around the body and high sodium, which raises both blood pressure and the chance of heart attacks and strokes.It's no fun to cut out salty snacks and red meat, but tasty alternatives can help you stay proactive about heart health without eating boiled chicken and rice cakes.If health isn't your hot button, simply eating better can also save cash. Turkey is certainly cheaper than steak, and a good diet can help negate the need for expensive high-cholesterol medication.Check out five easy alternatives that can go a long way ...No. 5: Soy nutsSnacking can be tough when you're keeping heart health in mind, but getting that crunchy fix is still possible without saying goodbye to flavor.Studies show that nuts lower the level of bad LDL cholesterol, and even lower the risk of developing blood clots. Nuts are also packed with fiber and heart-healthy vitamin E.Soy nuts might not sound like something satisfying to munch on, but, prepared right, they can give you a crunchy snack fix without munching on high-sodium or high-fat snacks.Instead of reaching for chips, toast some soy nuts with Italian herbs and some olive oil. And instead of salty nuts, try some toasted soy nuts with a dusting of sea salt. Taco seasoning can also give soy nuts a little bit of spice.Mixing those soy nuts with almonds or walnuts can make for a very satisfying medley that doesn't carry the high fat or high sodium of chips and dip.No. 4: TurkeyThe old way of heart-healthy eating meant sad, flavorless boiled chicken and white rice -- yuck.But no more. With countless cuts of turkey in your grocery store, you can get away from those tired chicken breasts without reaching for red meat.Burgers are the best, but getting that grill fix and staying healthy can be tricky.Ground turkey, however, can be a great alternative for heart health that will still give you something to eat at the weekend barbecue.You can spice it up with good herbs and grill it with olive oil. Pop some cheese on top for the whole package -- just stick to part-skim or a little high-flavor, small-serving gourmet cheese.Turkey can also replace beef in spaghetti sauces to get a little more flavor beyond the vegetarian sauce snoozer. Get it ground or chop it roughly for a chunky meat sauce.No. 3: FishGoing without red meat is the No. 1 thing you can do to stay on top of your heart health. But going without a good steak can get awfully boring, and turkey just doesn't cut it sometimes.So if you're looking for a big hearty meal, try a good size piece of salmon and some roast veggies. You'll get that big meat feeling, and plenty of taste, but instead of gristly beef fat, you're getting healthy omega-3 fatty acids.While replacing all your meat with salmon might get expensive, other fish are also packed with those healthy fats. Trout and herring are great places to find those good fatty acids.No email address was supplied by.

But what you might not know is that Newton's inspirational fruit has another key benefit -- giving a bad mood the boot.<COL>iStock / -ilkeryuksel-(NewsUSA) - Everyone's heard the age-old adage "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." But what you might not know is that Newton's inspirational fruit has another key benefit -- giving a bad mood the boot.Along with getting at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, incorporating several healthy food types into your diet, such as the ones listed below, will help alleviate symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression that can bog down your state of mind and daily productivity.* Omega-3 fatty acids. This essential nutrient, present in fishes like salmon and mackerel, has been highly researched for its mood and heart-boosting ability that will keep you feeling sharp. Omega-3 levels are higher in healthy brains than anywhere else in the human body, and experts agree that eating two meals of oily fish per week is highly beneficial to both mental and physical health.* Amino acids. Protein is the only food source for amino acids, an integral part of what your brain uses to regulate the four brain chemicals needed for stable moods.* High-quality carbohydrates and fiber. Avoiding refined, sugary carbs like the ones in regular soda, candy and fruit juice will keep you from experiencing a drastic spike in blood sugar, which will leave you feeling sluggish. Stick to the carbohydrates and soluble fiber in fruits and vegetables, beans, lentils and oatmeal for a long-lasting and steady energy source. Maintaining a strong immune system is the best way to stay energized without high sugar or caffeine.* Folic Acid and B12. Although no one has found a definitive answer as to why, low levels of folic acid and vitamin B12 have been linked to depression. Enjoy whole-grain breakfast cereals and many leafy greens for a healthy dose of folate.Including these "mood foods" in small meals or snacks -- and eating every three to four hours -- will keep your metabolism high, hunger pangs low and give you an extra mental lift to make it through whatever the day throws your way.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

While everyone should eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables and lean protein, age, activity levels and lifestyles influence the kinds of foods different people should consume.<COL>iStock/YinYang(NewsUSA) - Common sense says that different people need different diets for optimum health. While everyone should eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables and lean protein, age, activity levels and lifestyles influence the kinds of foods different people should consume. Here are some general tips about eating to boost your health:- For students. Sorry, but you really can't live on just pizza and soda. Long nights and busy schedules mean that you need to eat for optimum academic performance. Salmon, tuna fish, flax seeds and walnuts all contain Omega-3 fatty acids. In studies, Omega-3 fatty acids have been linked with healthier brain function. The night before a test, eat grilled salmon or sushi with miso soup. You will feel alert enough to pass your test the next morning -- provided that you also remembered to study.- For athletes. Unless you're training for the Olympics, you probably don't need to eat an extra pizza every night to recover lost calories. That being said, well-fed muscles recover more quickly after workouts. Athletes should aim to eat a small snack containing both protein and complex carbohydrates within a few hours after their workout. Good choices include peanut butter with whole-grain crackers and fruit with yogurt.- For busy professionals. Extra stress on the job contributes to fatigue, irritability and poorer immune function. Foods like arugula and almonds have immune-system-boosting properties, but busy schedules don't always leave enough time to toss together a healthy salad.If you skip meals or tend to eat on the run, try looking for healthy, 100 percent fruit juices for quick and lasting energy.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

And while healthier diets provide an obvious antidote to their fattier counterparts, there is an obvious reason Americans tend to choose foods in the latter category -- they taste awesome.So, if the challenge is to marry great taste with healthier intake, and the nation's well-being hinges on the result, health mavens couldn't do much better than to look toward today's more innovative restaurant chains.For example, recently chosen for the top spot on "Health" magazine's America's Healthiest Chain Restaurants list, UNO has found a way to offer a menu filled with healthy choices, and to have its customers embrace these choices enthusiastically."We start by rejecting the notion that healthy food must sacrifice taste," said Frank Guidara, CEO of UNO Chicago Grill. "That simply isn't true. Granted, to achieve both, you will require the highest level of culinary talent. But we have plenty of that at UNO, and that's why we knew we could create menu offerings that would be both healthy and delicious."A chef of great talent knows that for every unhealthy item added to enhance taste, a healthy alternative can be found or concocted. At UNO, that means diners can enjoy a roasted eggplant, spinach and feta flatbread pizza on multigrain crust without guilt or worry, since it has only 280 calories and six grams of fiber per serving. Diners can choose the multigrain crust option for any flatbread pizza. Another great option for a delicious entree is the lemon basil salmon, which has just 240 calories per serving.And when it comes to carbohydrates, UNO teamed with Barilla to offer whole grain penne as an option to any pasta -- helping to add more fiber and whole grains to your diet without sacrificing taste.Just as important as healthy choices is good, easy-to-access information. That's why UNO offers nutrition information through its Web site and on display in restaurant lobby kiosks, with categories that show diners which items are under 500 calories, which are vegetarian and which are created to serve those with food allergies. What's more, UNO's site offers tips for eating healthy in restaurants, including ways to lessen fat content and caloric intake without sacrificing flavor.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

An expert lets you know.<COL>Chrysler ImageLarry David, co-creator of the hit TV show "Seinfeld," made millions of dollars from the show before creating his own hit HBO show, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," where he portrays himself."Curb Your Enthusiasm" focuses on how, despite being rich and famous, David is very much an unchanged man. He still wears old sneakers and wrinkly clothes, still has the same gripes about life and still drives a Toyota Prius.David's wife, Laurie, is a prominent environmentalist and got David involved in environmental issues that are frequently explored on the show. For anyone who watches "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and knows David's comedy, the Prius, which is a hybrid, in many ways symbolizes the man himself -- unflashy and eco-friendly.What we drive in many ways makes a statement about who we are. Even trying to avoid making a statement -- like David driving an affordable car despite his millions -- ends up making a statement. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, was one of the richest men in the world, but drove around the same pickup truck for 30 years."That is a statement that (Walton) is making. He wants everyone to know that he is one of the boys," saidCharles Kenny, a psychologist who has worked with many of the major automakers trying to help them understand why consumers choose certain cars. "He's a regular guy, and just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that he thinks of himself as different."One thing that Kenny said has changed over time is the connection and identity drivers get from certain brands.Alfred P. Sloan, who served at various times as president, chairman and CEO of General Motors from 1923 through 1956, devised a hierarchy in the GM family that could serve consumers throughout their lifetime.Chevrolet was considered the entry-level car. As consumers moved up the economic ladder, they could move up from Pontiac to Oldsmobile to Buick to Cadillac, the luxury car. That approach helped make GM one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.But as GM lost its domination of the American market in the 1970s and '80s, other American companies rose up, along with an influx of foreign autos, and muddied the waters of brand identity."Today, you go from a Chevrolet to a Pontiac to a Buick, it's the same vehicle. They've just changed a few of the trinkets on it, nothing substantive," said Kenny. "And that's where the brands started to get killed."What now seems to have replaced brand identity in the mind of the American auto buyer is the type of vehicle they drive. Kenny said drivers now identify themselves more as an SUV driver or sports car driver than they do as a Cadillac driver or a Ford driver."A lot of consumers, when they buy a vehicle, are less concerned about the brand than the category of vehicle," said Kenny. "They tend to make that decision first. There seems to be more emotional intensity there."SUVsAn SUV can mean that you seek adventure and exploration.The SUV originated with the Jeep brand that was used extensively by the Allied forces in World War II. As a result, according to Kenny, the Jeep and other SUVs have come to represent the ability to go anywhere and do anything."My Jeep takes me places I could never go in another car, like off-roading in the desert or off-roading on mountain trails where no other cars go," said Tim Root, who lives in Los Angeles and has owned a Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Cherokee. "No other car could go there, not even an Explorer. The only places that could make it that I've been are Jeep Wranglers. Gas prices may have risen, but my needs haven't changed."Of course, many Jeep or SUV drivers never even take their cars off paved roads, but it is because of the endless potential of the SUV that many drivers buy them."It's because of the possibilities. 'I could if I want to. I could exercise that if I really wanted to or if I needed it.' It does have a very strong emotional benefit," said Kenny.Large SUVsKenny said that large SUVs like the Hummer fulfill the same emotional needs that an SUV does, but multiplied, especially for men."Even if they drive it just to the parking lot and don't get any mud on it, at 6 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday or Sunday it helps fulfill all of their fantasies of being a macho southern hombre who is out there hunting and fishing, doing the manly man stuff that men do," said Kenny.The exaggerated and oversize nature of the Hummer can also lead others to think there is a level of psychological overcompensation involved with the owner."I've thought about this a million times driving down the highway in L.A., Chicago, New York, wherever," saidcomedian Rodney Hoodwhen asked what goes through his mind when he sees a man driving a Hummer. "And I think, 'That guy probably has a girl at home that sits around all day and doesn't do a thing but try and avoid his sexual advances at all times. She's 20, he's 50, and she's trying to dodge him at all times."Sports carsKenny said that drivers of sports cars such as the Corvette are seeking power and control, but mostly control."You will find that Corvette owners are more sensitive and refined than you would think. They're not into hoarding it over other people the way that the Hummer owners are," said Kenny.The other emotional need that can be fulfilled is a desire for immortality."They get real upset if the paint job gets scratched. That's very upsetting to a Corvette owner. They want these things to last forever, and they want to last forever," said Kenny. "They're never going to sell it. In fact, a lot of Corvette owners, when they buy a new Corvette, they keep the other one."Muscle carsMuscle cars are becoming a rarer sight on the roads. GM discontinued the Pontiac Firebird and the Chevy Camaro in 2002, although the Camaro returned in 2009.They and the Ford Mustang have been traditionally identified as the poor man's Corvette because of their cheaper price, but Kenny said it is more complicated than that."The difference is that people who own those muscle cars actually do have an impulse control problem," said Kenny. "Corvette owners have it under control. They do not get speeding tickets. They do not wreck their cars. But the Camaro and Firebird owners, those people are much more likely to be weaving in and out of traffic."Kenny said many muscle car drivers ironically buy the cars as a means to try and control their impulses."But you can see that it doesn't work very well. They have impulses with regard to drinking, sexuality, drugs, addiction and serial marriages," said Kenny.Hood said he more often sees muscle cars in rural and suburban towns."I'm from Peoria, Ill., and when they said there was going to be no more Trans Ams, there were 38 suicides in Peoria," joked Hood. "And Paduka, Ky., had an epidemic of suicides, too."SedansThe difference in sedan drivers is the number of doors. Four-door sedans, according to Kenny, serve a need to be practical and nurturing, while two-door sedans fulfill a need for gender identity, especially with women."'It doesn't fit the type of woman that I am to drive a four-door sedan,'" Kenny said many female two-door sedan drivers say to themselves. "'That's for a woman with a family to drive. I'm a single woman. After all, I'd like to meet a guy and get married someday. If I drive around a beat up four-door sedan, that's not going to happen.'"The idea of the four-door sedan being for older or married people isn't limited to women. Hood, who worked as a car salesman before getting into comedy, said he drives around a 2000 Buick LeSabre that his father gave him."I am the youngest person in America to drive a Buick LeSabre, I think," said Hood, who is 39 and single. “I Googled it, and the next closest person was 117 years old, I'm almost positive. ... It'll put you to sleep. You might as well park that thing in an old folks home, sit in it and die. That’s what it feels like to drive a Buick LeSabre."Pickup trucksKenny said that when pickup truck makers came out with full size versions that included back seats, the identity of the pickup truck as a man's auto started to change, and middle-aged women started driving them."What's going on there, what they're looking for, is this is the strong woman, the independent woman who -- she may be happily married, often she is, she's not a man hater -- but she wants to feel like she can do just about all that there is to do in life and do it by herself."Compact pickup trucks, Kenny said, are viewed by many of their owners, especially men, as an extension of themselves more than other auto owners."It really gives him the flexibility to be that competent male who can do things for himself, his family and his friends," said Kenny.MinivansKenny said that the rise of the SUV gave mothers more options of what to drive at the expense of the minivan. As a result, mothers who continue to drive minivans today tend to be practical and traditional and not bothered the message a minivan sends."Gradually, what sort of emerged is this stigma for some women that a minivan is a mommy's van. 'That limits me to mother. I'm not a woman, I'm just a mother,'" said Kenny. "'If I'm driving a minivan, it says that I'm a mommy, I'm a mom, I'm a mother. I'm not a wife, I'm not a woman, I'm not a lover, I'm not a friend. I'm just a mom.' It's limiting."CrossoversAs a result of the stigma a minivan can carry, crossovers such as the Toyota Rav4 have become autos that mothers are more comfortable with, according to Kenny."I think the crossover offers women the opportunity to have the best of both worlds," said Kenny. "They can have the opportunity to fulfill their roles and yet not feel limited, not feel that people are looking at them in a narrow way and fulfill all the aspects of their gender identity."Luxury carsKenny said people purchase luxury cars for many reasons that all relate to one: the need for status."The need for status always comes into play when we are talking about expensive cars and brands, such as Cadillac and Lexus," said Kenny. "What is status about? It is one of the needs that comprise territorial survival, which is concerned bottom line with the following: 'I occupy territory that you do not!'"Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Without food, your body begins to conserve energy andburnfewer calories -- making your metabolism take a nosedive. That may be why, in one study, breakfast skippers were nearly five times more likely to be obese than breakfast eaters.The following meals are packed with special fat-fighting nutrients -- fiber, omega-3s,calcium, andvitaminD -- a power combination that burns fat and keeps blood sugar (and energy) levels steady. Start your morning with one of these delicious, nutritious choices.Good Lox BagelTop a small whole-grain bagel with 2 ounces of canned salmon and 2 tablespoons of low-fat cream cheese for a healthy breakfast that feels more indulgent than it is. The key is portion control—avoid huge calorie-bomb bagels.Coconut Rice Pudding With RaspberriesSimply stir together 1/4 cup instant brownriceand 3/4 cup water in a microwavable mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving a small vent for steam to escape. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Reduce the power to medium and cook for 3 minutes longer. Take out and let sit and soften for 5 minutes. After that, you're ready to stir in 2 tablespoons of nonfat dry milk, 1 teaspoon of honey, and 1/8 teaspoon ofcoconutextract. Gently fold in 1/2 cup fresh or loose-pack frozen and thawed raspberries for waist-whittlingfiber. Spoon into a cereal bowl if you're eating in or a thermos if you need a take-with-you option.Ginger Mango SmoothieWhip up this drink and refrigerate it overnight for a simple grab-and-go breakfast in the morning. Combine 1/2 cup low-fat vanillayogurt, 1/2 cup peeled and chopped mango, 2 ounces soft tofu, 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped crystallized ginger, 1/2 teaspoonflaxseedoil, and a pinch of cardamom in a blender.

The Cabbage Soup diet, the Fat Flush diet and the Blood Type diet are some of the more unusual, yet even the most ridiculous monikers do little to preserve your overall nutrition.The reason why fad diets typically don't work, according to sports and lifestyle dietitian Molly Kimball, RD, is that they aren't designed to succeed in the long term. "In reality, a successful diet is one that doesn't sacrifice flavor, taste or nutrition and incorporates your favorite foods every day." So scratch the word "diet" out of your vocabulary and follow these four tips for fresh, healthy eating:Keep calories in check. "Even if you exercise an hour every day, there are still 23 hours where you can negate it," says Kimball. "You still have to keep an eye on what you're eating." She advises that you spend your calories on foods high in fiber, protein and healthy fat. Since the body takes longer to digest these nutrients, you'll be left feeling fuller, longer. For a snack, try a quarter cup of reduced fat cheese melted on a whole wheat tortilla. Low in calories but high in fiber and protein, this snack keeps you powering until the next meal.Fill up on veggies. Instead of ham, turkey and roast beef thrown between two slabs of bread with cheese and extra mayo, keep the lean protein and incorporate loads of vegetables (raw, grilled or roasted) into a low-carb, high-fiber tortilla. "You'll be slashing calories but still get the satisfaction of eating a full sandwich, along with loads of fiber-rich, nutrient-dense vegetables," says Kimball.Choose healthy fats. Olive oil and fatty fish get a lot of attention for a reason: they're both filled with healthy fats. The monounsaturated fat in oil and the omega-3's in fish not only help to keep hunger at bay, they also boost your heart health by raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. Get your fill of both with a La Tortilla Factory Extra-Virgin Olive Oil SoftWrap smeared with cream cheese and a little bit of salmon.Lighten the foods you love. The bottom line is calories, but is giving up your favorite foods worth it? Of course not. Instead of a massive burrito stuffed with cheese, refried beans and sour cream, use a whole wheat tortilla and pile on lean protein, grilled veggies and fresh salsa for an authentic Mexican meal that tastes great with a fraction of the fat and calories.For healthy ideas and recipes, visitwww.latortillafactory.com.No email address was supplied by.

Sean Parnell signed Senate Bill 57 into law Wednesday, changing the date that school districts have to notify teachers of layoffs or non-retention from March 16 to May 15. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary Stevens (R-Kodiak), is designed to prevent districts from laying off teachers before learning whether the Legislature appropriated money for retaining teachers."If I were teaching and I (saw) the Legislature hadn't made a final decision until the legislative session was over and I was given a pink slip, I would start looking around for another job,” Stevens said.The budget cycle for the Anchorage School District, the state's largest district, often presents teachers with that very dilemma. ASD must have a balanced budget completed in January -- a good three months before the Legislature finalizes its education funding package."There has been an occasion when in the past where individuals were issued layoff notices, and then additional funding from the state was authorized and then we rescinded those notices," said Todd Hess, ASD's human resources director.Critics, including National Education Association-Alaska President Ron Fuhrer, say the change will hurt rural school districts."Some school districts -- for example, subsistence, teachers going out and fishing -- so they're not in contact with media or by telephone in some cases,” Fuhrer said.Fuhrer says he unsuccessfully proposed a compromise moving the deadline up from May 15 to late April.Other components in Stevens' bill include a ramped-up effort at the state level to provide parents with materials on the importance of reading to children before they hit the third grade. A separate element ties the funding of student transportation costs to the Consumer Price Index, a metric that tracks inflation.Contact Adam Pinsker(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Since I live in North Carolina, that means our first stop will be a barbecue pit with either a pork butt (Boston butt to you out-of-staters) or a whole pork shoulder properly rubbed and smoking slowly. In Carolina, it’s all about pork, with pulled pork being the pinnacle of barbecue perfection.Smoking a cheap cut of pork until the gristly connective tissue melts away and the end result is succulent, flavorful meat with a kiss of smoke that’s just waiting for some vinegary, sometimes hot and spicy sauce is an art. In Eastern N.C., you’ll find whole-hog and pork shoulder barbecue most prominent, while Western N.C. ‘cue is more likely to involve the pork butts.Rubs are a critical part of the Carolina barbecue mojo, and you would be more likely to talk Coke out of their secret formula than you would to talk a grizzled barbecue veteran out of his rub recipe. Some recipes have been passed orally from generation to generation, never once written down.I have to take a moment to mention the mustard sauce that’s very popular in South Carolina. You might be taken aback by a yellow barbecue sauce, but there are some fantastic flavors in some of the mustards.Let’s head west a bit to Memphis, where the humid air off the Mississippi makes the smell of smoking ribs hang in the air. If your idea of a good meal involves tearing meat from bone, you’ll find a home here. Ribs are served wet, where they are basted with sauce before, during and after cooking, or dry, where a rib rub is applied liberally and often allowed to sit on the ribs for several hours before smoking.Each school has its adherents, and you would do well to sample liberally from both schools. The classic Memphis barbecue sauce is tomato-based, with a spicy-sweet hit that will vary widely depending on the restaurant.You’ll even find some places that don’t smoke their ribs at all, preferring to use a commercial oven and let the rub and/or sauce do the talking. ‘Cue purists by and large avoid such modern innovations.That said, you can make some of the best ribs you have ever tasted at home using the same method. The folks at Williamson House make aRib Kitthat contains everything you need to make insanely good baby back ribs in your oven. I haven’t smoked a single rack of ribs since I started using their method. There’s even a video on the website that takes you step by step through the process.Farther west we come to Kansas City, home of the American Royal Barbecue and home base of one of the largest barbecue judging federations in the country. Kansas City was once the king of the stockyards, and that heritage continues in the barbecue, which embraces pretty much every sort of beast slow and stupid enough to let humans catch and eat it. A great example is Jack Stack’s Barbecue, where you can find beef, pork, sausage, chicken, lamb and turkey in various preparations. While some from other regions argue that the proliferation of meats leads to a lack of focus and thus a lower overall quality, the continued popularity of KC ‘cue would seem to give the lie to that. Nowhere does the carnivore flag fly more proudly than in Kansas City’s hallowed barbecue halls.While rub and smoke are both important to Kansas City barbecue, the real secret is the sauce. The classic KC sauce is fairly sweet, with a tomato/molasses base, and quite thick. You will need extra napkins, Wet-Naps and quite possibly a garden hose to clean yourself up after a proper KC barbecue feast.And now, finally, we head south, to my adopted home state of Texas, where beef brisket is king and sauce is usually very much optional.The most recognized and imitated form of Texas barbecue is the Central Texas style practiced in Austin as well as in the Texas ‘cue capitals of Luling, Taylor and Lockhart. In this style, a properly rubbed (and occasionally marinated) whole beef brisket is smoked with tremendous slowness using smoke from pecan or oak wood. Many people suffer from the erroneous belief that mesquite is used in the process, but mesquite imparts a distinctively bitter flavor that can just flat ruin a brisket when cooking “low and slow.”If you want a spice blend that will get you well on your way to a spicy Texas rub, the folks atDeYoung's Fore Seasonshave a new Chipotle Blend that has an amazing spicy, smoky but not overpoweringly hot kick. It's outstanding on beef and can really wake up roasted chicken if you get some up under the skin and let it work its magic on the meat. Their original recipe is good on ... well ... everything. My favorite ways to use it are on oven-roasted red potatoes and grilled salmon, and it's also an ingredient in my pork rub.If you go into a barbecue restaurant in Luling, expect to be sold beef and probably sausage, with a stack of white bread slices and sides such as beans, pickles and jalapenos. You would do well not to ask for sauce, as it is a matter of pride among many barbecue chefs that their meat speaks for itself.If you do find a sauce offered, it will almost always be on the side. Personally, I won’t eat at a Texas place that sauces the meat before it’s handed to me. They’re hiding something. The sauce itself is actually a fairly complex and tasty affair with tomato, brown sugar, vinegar and a whole host of herbs and spices along for the ride.Hungry yet?Got a question? Comment?

Challenge Alaska was founded in 1980 and incorporated in 1981 by Douglas Keil and other individuals dedicated to providing sports and recreation opportunities for the disabled. Mr. Keil was electrocuted at age 14 and as a result his left arm and leg were amputated. After struggling for years with depression resulting in drug and alcohol abuse, in 1975 Doug visited Winter Park, Colorado, which turned his life around. After winning two Gold Medals in Norway with the US Disabled Alpine Ski Team, Doug was determined to bring those same opportunities to the disabled community of Alaska and in 1980 Challenge Alaska was born. Beginning in a broom closet at Alyeska Ski Resort with less than a dozen participants Challenge Alaska now serves over 1,000 people with disabilities each year with a wide variety of programs and services from Sled Hockey to Hospital Based Therapy as well as Book Clubs, Cooking Groups, Camping, Fishing, Soccer, and much more.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

McKenzie said he took a bad path, ignoring the color and feel of the mud, and found himself in trouble when he stopped moving.By the time McKenzie realized his mistake, his legs were sinking into the mud. The tide was coming in and the mud was up to McKenzie's waist when someone found him, but the incoming tide turned out to be a good thing, according to McKenzie."[The tide] started coming up and I looked back and as the water was coming up I realized it was going to help get my legs out," McKenzie said.According to AFD firefighter Tommy Etheredge, minimal efforts were made by AFD to pull McKenzie out."All we did at this point was we tied a rope around the patient and coached him to lean back-and-forth to loosen himself, and it was successful," Etheredge said.For more information on mudflat safety, check out these previous stories.Contact Jessica Ridgway(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Since I live in North Carolina, that means our first stop will be a barbecue pit with either a pork butt (Boston butt to you out-of-staters) or a whole pork shoulder properly rubbed and smoking slowly. In Carolina, it’s all about pork, with pulled pork being the pinnacle of barbecue perfection.Smoking a cheap cut of pork until the gristly connective tissue melts away and the end result is succulent, flavorful meat with a kiss of smoke that’s just waiting for some vinegary, sometimes hot and spicy sauce is an art. In Eastern N.C., you’ll find whole-hog and pork shoulder barbecue most prominent, while Western N.C. ‘cue is more likely to involve the pork butts.Rubs are a critical part of the Carolina barbecue mojo, and you would be more likely to talk Coke out of their secret formula than you would to talk a grizzled barbecue veteran out of his rub recipe. Some recipes have been passed orally from generation to generation, never once written down.I have to take a moment to mention the mustard sauce that’s very popular in South Carolina. You might be taken aback by a yellow barbecue sauce, but there are some fantastic flavors in some of the mustards.Let’s head west a bit to Memphis, where the humid air off the Mississippi makes the smell of smoking ribs hang in the air. If your idea of a good meal involves tearing meat from bone, you’ll find a home here.

The community of Bean's Café gathers together to honor all the people connected with the nonprofit who have passed away over the years.Bean's executive director Lisa Sauder says it's a chance to recognize the people who were a part of the group."Many of these people don't have a lot of family support, and truly Bean's Café and the clients and staff here have become their family and their close friends," Sauder said. "It's very important that we keep their memory alive."The group held a candlelight vigil inside the Bean's location on Friday, where more than 600 names, from clients to volunteers, were read aloud.Clients like Chris Jamison, who read names during the vigil. He says the event isn't a time for goodbyes, but rather, a time for reflection."It's not necessarily mourning their loss, but a celebration of their life," Jamison said.Jamison didn't realize he knew some of the people named until he heard his friend Martha Thomas' name called."I didn't know a good friend of mine passed away until today, and it was very touching, very emotional," Jamison said.While it was a surprise for some, others like Daniel Garcia say it was a time to make sure everyone feels noticed."A lot of times these people don't feel that way and it's nice to show them that we care and even after they're gone you are going to remember them," Garcia said.Garcia has been a client and volunteer for Bean's Café over the last few years, and says he's in between jobs as a fish processor. Beans allows him to spend time with those he calls "family.""It makes me feel good," Garcia said. "Those are my friends, and if I can help them out you know in any way I can, I like to do that."For Garcia, honoring those who passed away is a bittersweet feeling."It's hard to know that they're gone, and in some circumstances that led up to that, but you know that they're in a better place and I'm happy for that," Garcia said.While it can be difficult at times to think about the people who have passed, the message Bean's Café carries is a powerful one."We like to show our clients who are here now that even though they're gone we're not going to forget them," Garcia said.Sauder says Bean's Cafe will start new volunteer initiatives after the first of January 2014. They'll be looking for groups to plan birthday parties for their clients.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Paul’s death at about 9:40 p.m. Thursday.“Investigation determined (Paul) was working on a 38 foot fishing vessel in Chignik Lagoon when he fell into an area near the engine of the boat,” troopers wrote. “Paul was retrieved from the boat and transported to the Chignik Lagoon Clinic where he was pronounced deceased.”AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says that while it’s not clear why Paul fell into the engine area, no foul play is suspected in his death.“Basically, he fell on the shaft that turns the propeller,” Ipsen said. “He fell down the engine room hole -- it’s about a five-foot drop.”Ipsen says Paul is no relation to 58-year-old Harberg Paul of Kipnuk, who was killed in a fire aboard a gillnetter moored in Egegik early Thursday that also left his two brothers with burns.In another Thursday accident aboard a fishing tender off Ninilchik, Wisconsin man Lewis Byerly, 55, died after getting caught in a motorized winch for an anchor chain.Troopers say the state medical examiner’s office has been contacted and an autopsy has been requested in the Chignik Lagoon death. Joey Paul’s next of kin have been notified.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Bruce Bannister (R-Greenville) identified the victims as members of two Greenville families -- including Milton Antonakos, his wife Kimberly, and their three children, as well as Chris and Stacy McManus and their two children.The Antonakos family usually vacationed together in Myrtle Beach, S.C., each summer, but the father of Kimberly Antonakos tells The Associated Press his daughter and her family decided to travel to Alaska from their home in Greenville, S.C., for 10 days this year instead.H. Wayne Clayton says his son-in-law sold computer software to hospitals and doctors' offices, while Kimberly shuffled the three children to their many activities. The children were 16-year-old Olivia, 14-year-old Mills and 11-year-old Anastacia.A Monday update relayed on the Soldotna Police Department’s behalf by Alaska State Troopers says authorities are still working to verify the identities of the victims. Employees of Nikiski-based Rediske Air have confirmed that Nikiski resident and company owner Willy Rediske was at the de Havilland DHC-3 Otter’s controls; he also died in the crash.“SPD is working diligently with South Carolina authorities to identify and locate the probable next of kin,” officials wrote. “The names of the victims, as well as other potential identifying information, will not be released until the remains of individuals have been positively identified by the State Medical Examiner.”In a hastily held press conference Monday at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the investigation into the crash is set to last from five to eight days, but a final report on the crash could take up to a year.The Otter in the crash wasn't equipped with a flight data recorder or a black box, and its wreckage will be moved to a Soldotna hangar.Monday’s announcement marks the second Alaska plane crash in less than two weeks in which passengers from South Carolina have died. Laurie Buckner of Simpsonville, S.C., 52, and John Ellenberg of Greenville, S.C., 74, died along with Sheilacom, Wash. pilot Dale Hemman, 61, in the June 28 crash of a B-55 Beech Baron near Cantwell.The National Transportation Safety Board says the Otter departed with nine passengers and one pilot and local authorities received reports of a plane crash at about 11:20 a.m. Sunday. NTSB officials say the single-engine plane likely crashed during take-off.“The fixed-wing aircraft was located fully engulfed at the airport and the flames were put out by CES,” Alaska State Troopers wrote in a news release based on information from the Soldotna Police Department. “There were no survivors located.”"Weather at the time of the crash was reported to be cloudy with a light wind," AST said in Sunday evening update.SPD, Fire and Medic personnel with CES and the Alaska State Troopers responded to scene, which is located down Funny River Road in Soldotna.SPD Chief Peter Mlynarik noted the plane was heading to a fishing lodge across the Cook Inlet. It’s still unknown which lodge the plane was traveling to and why the plane was heading there.One NTSB investigator has been on scene since Sunday afternoon and a major go-team from Washington D.C. will be launched, according to Clint Johnson, chief of the NTSB in Anchorage. He says another Alaska-based investigator heading to San Francisco for the Asiana Airlines crash will return to the state and help investigate the Soldotna crash."Any accident with fatalities or serious injuries is horrible,” Johnson said. “Once it reaches the threshold of eight or 10 fatalities, we have different responses as far as the NTSB goes - that's why we are launching a major go-team on this accident.”Troopers said all the remains were recovered and will be sent State Medical Examiner's Office in Anchorage for autopsy and positive identification.This is a developing story.

In return, federal officials would have handed over a 206-acre road corridor through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to a jet-capable airport in Cold Bay.In a statement announcing the decision Monday, Jewell cited the department's extensive research into the land swap -- a deal opposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- as a factor in her decision.“After careful consideration, I support (USFWS's) conclusion that building a road through the Refuge would cause irreversible damage not only to the Refuge itself, but to the wildlife that depend on it," Jewell said in the statement. "Izembek is an extraordinary place -- internationally recognized as vital to a rich diversity of species -- and we owe it to future generations to think about long-term solutions that do not insert a road through the middle of this Refuge and designated wilderness."Jewell says in her Monday statement that local governments had been considering contingency plans in the event a road wasn't built, including both conventional and hovercraft ferries.In a statement from King Cove authorities on Jewell’s decision Monday, Della Trumble -- a spokesperson for the King Cove Corp. and the Agdaagux Tribal Council -- blasted Jewell for abdicating her responsibilities in her decision.“We are very insulted that our health, safety and quality of life simply do not matter to her,” Trumble said. “Clearly, the Secretary’s trust responsibility to the Native people is very subjective and, is in fact, meaningless.”Reached by phone Monday, Trumble says she’s “totally disheartened” by the timing of the decision shortly before Christmas.“Honestly, it makes a strong statement to exactly what type of person we’re dealing with in the Interior office,” Trumble said. “I believe, honestly, that the choice to pick sports hunters and the environmental community over the Aleut people of King Cove is in (Jewell’s) best interest.”Both of Alaska’s senators issued statements in opposition to Monday’s decision, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski citing the hypocrisy of allowing hunting in the refuge.“I am angered and deeply disappointed by Jewell’s decision to continue to put the lives of the people of King Cove in danger, simply for the convenience of a few bureaucrats and the alleged peace of the birds in the refuge, despite the fact that many thousands of birds are killed by hunters annually,” Murkowski said.Sen. Mark Begich called the move part of a pattern familiar to Alaskans.“It’s the same sad story -- a federal agency that doesn’t listen to Alaskans,” Begich said. “Even after visiting King Cove and hearing first-hand the tragic consequences of critically ill people being transported through 12-foot seas to get medical care, Washington bureaucrats have determined that the environmental impact of a single lane road somehow outweighs the health of Alaskans. Today’s decision is disappointing but unfortunately not surprising.”Begich says he'll introduce legislation to build the road when Congress reconvenes next month.Trumble says the people of King Cove, who locals say have seen at least 12 deaths due to plane crashes and inadequate medical treatment, will keep fighting for a road. She dismisses Jewell’s offer to help with alternatives out of hand, “because no other option is viable.”“That was explained to her, and explained to the many people who have come to King Cove,” Trumble said.Channel Two's Adam Pinsker contributed to this report.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Because of the way your body processes these four foods, they can lead to cravings forcarbohydrates, also called sugars. By eliminating them, you decrease food cravings, making it easier to eat less and lose weight.The grains in white bread, white pasta and white rice are refined through a milling process that strips off the bran layer to give them a finer texture. After that process, these foods are little more than carbohydrates that your body digests quickly and easily.The main problem with white rice, bread, pasta and potatoes is that they trigger a cycle of food craving. After you eat them, they release a sudden spike of sugar in your bloodstream. Your body responds to that extra sugar by releasing insulin. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that allows sugar to enter your cells, lowering the amount of sugar in your blood.Because your blood sugar level goes up quickly after eating these foods, your body may release more insulin than it really needs. The extra insulin causes blood sugar to then drop lower than normal. When your body senses low blood sugar, you crave more carbohydrates. When you eat them, they once again raise your blood sugar, starting the cycle over. The result of this process is that you eat more food, more often.In addition, as you eat more of these foods, your body needs to process all the extra sugar. Although some sugar is burned off as energy, most is converted into fat, leading to weight gain.To get beyond the cycle of food cravings, I typically recommend to patients who want to lose weight that they completely avoid white bread, white rice, white pasta and potatoes for two weeks. After that, you can introduce them back into your diet in smaller, reasonable amounts.Those two weeks can be hard because your body will have strong cravings for these foods. But during that time, the cravings should gradually decrease. Eating plant-based proteins such as nuts, beans and lentils can help. Lean meat and fish also can be good sources of healthy protein to include in your diet instead of rice, pasta, bread and potatoes.Keep in mind, too, that the whole-grain alternatives of some of these foods can be healthy options if you eat them in moderation and keep portion sizes reasonable. Whole grains have not had the bran and germ removed through milling. They are better sources of fiber and other important nutrients, such as selenium, potassium and magnesium, than are refined grains. Whole grains can be single foods, such as brown rice and popcorn, as well as ingredients in other products, such as buckwheat in pancakes or whole wheat in bread.Although avoiding white bread, pasta, rice and potatoes can be a useful step toward weight loss, it should be done as part of a healthy program that includes a balanced diet, along with exercise. For guidance on weight loss plans that may be right for you, consider meeting with a dietitian or talk with your doctor.—Jon Ebbert, M.D., Primary Care Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.Source: http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tuesday-q-a-reducing-four-white-foods-in-your-healthy-diet-may-make-it-easier-to-eat-less-lose-weighNo email address was supplied by.

Unlike other fats, trans fat — also called trans-fatty acids — both raises your "bad" (LDL) cholesterol and lowers your "good" (HDL) cholesterol.A high LDL cholesterol level in combination with a low HDL cholesterol level increases your risk of heart disease, the leading killer of men and women. Here's some information about trans fat and how to avoid it.Trans fat is made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil through a process called hydrogenation, which makes the oil less likely to spoil. Using trans fats in the manufacturing of foods helps foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and have a less greasy feel.Scientists aren't sure exactly why, but the addition of hydrogen to oil increases your cholesterol more than do other types of fats. It's thought that adding hydrogen to oil makes the oil more difficult to digest, and your body recognizes trans fats as saturated fats.Commercial baked goods — such as crackers, cookies and cakes — and many fried foods, such as doughnuts and french fries — may contain trans fats. Shortenings and some margarines can be high in trans fat.Trans fat used to be more common, but in recent years food manufacturers have used it less because of concerns over the health effects of trans fat. Food manufacturers in the United States and many other countries list the trans fat content on nutrition labels.However, you should be aware of what nutritional labels really mean when it comes to trans fat. For example, in the United States if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, the food label can read 0 grams trans fat. Though that's a small amount of trans fat, if you eat multiple servings of foods with less than 0.5 grams of trans fat, you could exceed recommended limits.How do you know whether food contains trans fat? Look for the words "partially hydrogenated" vegetable oil. That's another term for trans fat.It sounds counterintuitive, but "fully" or "completely" hydrogenated oil doesn't contain trans fat. Unlike partially hydrogenated oil, the process used to make fully or completely hydrogenated oil doesn't result in trans-fatty acids. However, if the label says just "hydrogenated" vegetable oil, it could mean the oil contains some trans fat.Although small amounts of trans fat occur naturally in some meat and dairy products, it's the trans fats in processed foods that seem to be more harmful.Doctors worry about trans fat because of its unhealthy effect on your cholesterol levels — increasing your LDL and decreasing your HDL cholesterol. There are two main types of cholesterol:A high LDL cholesterol level is a major risk factor for heart disease. If your LDL is too high, over time, it can cause atherosclerosis, a dangerous accumulation of fatty deposits on the walls of your arteries. These deposits — called plaques — can reduce blood flow through your arteries. If the arteries that supply your heart with blood (coronary arteries) are affected, you may have chest pain and other symptoms of coronary artery disease.If plaques tear or rupture, a blood clot may form — blocking the flow of blood or breaking free and plugging an artery downstream. If blood flow to part of your heart stops, you'll have a heart attack. If blood flow to part of your brain stops, a stroke occurs.Doctors are most concerned about the effect of trans fat on cholesterol. However, trans fat has also been shown to have some other harmful effects:The good news is trans fat is showing up less in food, especially food on grocery store shelves. If you eat out a lot, however, be aware that some restaurants continue to use trans fat. Trans fat is sometimes a part of the oil restaurants use to fry food. A large serving of french fries at some restaurants can contain 5 grams or more of trans fat.How much trans fat you can safely consume is debatable. However, there's no question you should limit trans fat, according to the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association (AHA).No email address was supplied by.

I could’ve been healthier but I think I deserve some bonus points for making an effort to consume fruits and vegetables at times when I just wanted to curl up in bed and hibernate between runs to the porcelain Goddess. I’ve also been extra careful about not eating all those things on that long list of no-no’s that my doctor gave to me. And I take my prenatal vitamins every day -- that counts for something, right?You’re probably wondering why you should listen to me about eating healthy while pregnant. Shouldn’t you be listening to someone with an A-plus average? Well, I happen to be a research junkie and, as usual, I’ve consumed a LOT of pregnancy books, magazine articles, and information from trustworthy healthcare organizations. So, even if I’m notfollowingthe perfect eating plan, the information I’m passing along is from truly trustworthy sources.The best motivation to eat healthy is the little guy or gal growing inside you. We want to give them the best chance at living long, healthy lives and that starts in the womb. When I’m craving something greasy and fried or sticky sweet, I think about the fact that my baby will also be ingesting this greasy, sugary item. When I stop to think about that, I often end up reaching for the salad, veggies, or fruit. Of course, there are the times that I do give in to the cravings, and it’s okay to do that once in a while. After all, at least ice cream helps me meet my calcium quota!Your second best motivation is YOU. The better you eat, the better you’ll feel. I proved this to myself after a work-related trip where I said yes to WAY too many desserts and then endured a sleepless night of stomach cramps and severe nausea. Whether or not the desserts were purely to blame, I decided to take it easy on the sweets going forward and I haven’t had another night quite that bad. Being pregnant already has the potential to cause us various discomforts including nausea, exhaustion, dizziness, backaches, and headaches (should I go on?), so we really need to do our best to eat food that will help our bodies stay as strong and healthy as possible during this time.My favorite pregnancy related book is calledNine Months In, Nine Months Out, a reference guide written by expert moms. It talks about boosting your body’s healing capabilities by eating foods that contain certain vitamins and nutrients that help us prego gals keep the nausea at bay and increase energy while maintaining a calm mind. As a general rule, they recommend including the following in your daily diet during pregnancy:Every pregnancy is different; however, we should all strive to get the basic nutrients we need to make our little ones as healthy as possible. If you find yourself lacking motivation, just remind yourself of the baby you’re carrying and the fact that you’ll feel better the next day if you choose the right foods for your body. And, like I mentioned before, it’s okay to treat yourself to something not-so-healthy (within reason, NOT something on the no-no list, like raw fish) once in a while, just try to keep it balanced overall. And, of course, try to enjoy what you’re eating while pregnant, even the fruits and veggies. Mini-you will appreciate that too.Source: Pure MattersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

I flew here yesterday for a family reunion. I am used to my bathroom in Brooklyn, and I wasn't really mindful of what I was doing when I woke up and rolled into the bathroom. I pulled my wedding ring and my engagement ring off of my finger when I washed my hands, and experienced that moment of horror and disbelief when your diamond engagement ring slips out of your fingers and into the drain of an unfamiliar bathroom sink."No," I said. "No. Nooooooooooo. Nooooooooooo."My sister came to the bathroom and said, "You didn't.""I did," I said."Oh my G-d you dropped your ring down the drain," my sister said. It was 6:30 AM. She had just finished diapering her baby. The gentle foggy light of morning in San Francisco was the only light in the house, save the bathroom light."I can get it out. I just need a wrench, a bucket, and a wire hanger," I said. I really was that cool, and I'll tell you why. I have cleaned out a few P-traps (AKA U-bends) before, and I knew that the ring had not gone far. I figured it was stuck in a wad of hair in the bottom of the P-trap.Before attempting the full P-trap clean out, I thought I'd try to get the ring out of the drain by fishing it out with a wire hanger bent into a hook.The results were lackluster. I pulled up a bunch of hair and shmutz.At that point, I knew it was time to bring in the big guns in order to get my diamond engagement ring out of thesink drain. I got out my sister's lone wrench and positioned a plastic bowl under the sink. I turned off the water supply to the sink. And then...the wrench was too small to fit around the pipe connectors. I thought about calling aSan Francisco plumber, but I knew I could do it myself if I had a bigger wrench. My sister, who was more upset about the dropping of my ring into her drain than I was (I don't think she realized how easy it is to get a ring out of a drain), offered to drive me to a home repair store. I thanked her profusely and accepted the offer.I got dressed, and brushed my teeth. I had to brush my teeth in her kitchen (the bathroom sink was out of service) while my sister fed her baby oatmeal.We were the only non-contractors in the store at 7:30 AM. I bought a nice, big adjustable plumbing wrench. It was $14.50, which was a lot less money thancalling a plumber. Also, there is just something inherently embarrassing to me about calling a plumber to empty a P-trap, when it issuch an easy DIY plumbing repair.I loosened the pipe connector with the wrench. Righty tighty, lefty loosie.Then I pulled the P-trap out. Boom. It's that easy. Most P-traps have one end that has a pipe connector that has to be unscrewed, and the other end is just a shoe that the sink's drain pipe fits into. Sometimes, though, you need to loosen a pipe connector at both ends. Simply unscrew the pipe connector(s), and pull down. I dumped the P-trap into a bowl, and out came a bunch of grungy water, hair, weird brown bits, and my engagement ring.With literally zero stress and misery, I got my engagement ring containing my great grandmother's diamond (!) out of the drain. I put the P-trap back in, and tightened the pipe connector. I turned the water back on, and then cleaned the gunk from the P-trap out of the sink.So the moral of the story is: If you drop a ring down a sink drain, there is no need to panic. Just don't run the water. Take out the P-trap, and dump it out. Your ring will probably be there, along with (possibly) other long lost treasures.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/how-to-get-a-ring-out-of-the-sink-drainNo email address was supplied by.

Fishermen aboard other boats moored at the Alaska General Seafoods cannery dock said they noticed flames coming from the 32-foot gillnetter Pauline II.“Joe Paul, 50, and Paul Paul, 55, were pulled from the boat and taken to the Egegik Clinic before they were flown elsewhere for treatment of burns suffered in the fire,” troopers wrote. “First responders at the dock put out the fire and kept the flames from spreading to nearby boats.”Shortly after the fire, which left the boat a total loss, searchers aboard it found a body believed to be that of 56-year-old Harberg Paul. The body was declared dead at the clinic at 4:30 a.m.With poor weather preventing troopers from reaching the scene, an Alaska Wildlife Trooper was diverted from nearby commercial fishing enforcement work to begin an investigation. A deputy state fire marshal had flown from Anchorage as of Friday night to assist the wildlife trooper.AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says the Paul brothers are well-known in both Egegik and Kipnuk.Harberg Paul’s next of kin have been notified, and the remains found aboard the Pauline II have been sent to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage for an autopsy and confirmation of their identity.No foul play is suspected in the fire.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Peyerk and his mother, 66-year-old Charlotte M. Peyerk, were sentenced Monday in Fairbanks by Magistrate Judge Scott A. Oravec. The two pleaded guilty in September to conspiring to violate federal wildlife laws, taking a grizzly bear out of season in ANWR, and making a false record of wildlife shipped interstate.Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Cooper says the Peyerks and their guides agreed to illegally shoot the bear on the day before hunting season’s opening day. At their sentencing, Oravec noted aggravating circumstances surrounding their deliberate cover-up of the illegal kill.“The Peyerks’ cameras had the date indicator altered to make it appear the bear was killed on opening day,” prosecutors wrote. “They also falsified the date of kill on a State of Alaska record and on a Safari Club International trophy entry form. Believing the false statements, Safari Club International awarded Charlotte Peyerk the ‘Diana Award’ for ‘ethics in hunting.’”Cooper says the case dates back to a visit several seasons ago by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents to an ANWR camp operated by Fair Chase Hunts.“They found a few violations, and one thing just led to another,” Cooper said.The subsequent investigation has led to almost a dozen arrests of Fair Chase Hunts participants, most of whom Cooper describes as “assistant guides, packers, an occasional hunter.”The two major cases, however, were made against the firm’s operators, including master guide Joe Hendricks. Hendricks pleaded guilty last year to 13 federal counts, including conducting a commercial enterprise on a wildlife refuge without a special use permit.“He was the head of the whole thing, pretty much,” Cooper said. “He was one of the few master guides in Alaska history.”Registered guide Christopher Cassidy, Fair Chase Hunts’ other operator, apparently became involved with the company because he had a hunting plot in ANWR adjacent to Hendricks’. He pleaded guilty in 2011 to 16 counts, including wanton waste of game and the sale of unlawfully taken and possessed wildlife.“He was a partner and involved in a plan to ultimately buy out Hendricks,” Cooper said.At Monday’s sentencing, each of the Peyerks was fined $20,000, with the two also ordered to make a total of $15,000 in community service payments to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The Peyerks also forfeited the bear and hunting rifle from the incident, as well as their hunting privileges during Mark Peyerk’s five years of probation and Charlotte Peyerk’s four years.Oravec also ordered the Peyerks to write letters of apology to Safari Club International for fraudulently submitting the bear kill for the Diana Award, which Charlotte Peyerk must offer to return.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

But that's not always the case.“It’s kind of sad to just think of her sitting down in a mothball fleet and possibly eventually just going away,” said retired Coast Guardsman Brett Farrell.What today sits as a lifeless hull on California's Sacramento River was once the pride of the Coast Guard fleet in Alaska.“The proof's in the pudding. She did it for almost 60, almost 70 years, most of which running around the Bering Sea and came back every time,” Farrell said of the cutter Storis.He spent about two years working as chief electrician onboard the Storis.“Our job was to keep foreign vessels from fishing in our waters,” he said.Despite the often mundane missions, Brett best describes his connection to the ship with a story about the time a woman from Nome boarded on a tour and teared up when she saw the sick bay where she gave birth to the son she recently lost.“Her son's middle name was Storis actually, so you just don't hear stories like that on any other cutter that I've been attached to,” Farrell said.Other former crew members recall the time the Storis was first to arrive on a scene off the coast of St. Paul Island. The Alaskan Monarch, a fishing vessel, had run aground.When the situation became truly desperate, it was the Coast Guard that saved the crew’s lives.But perhaps Storis' most significant accomplishment was in 1957 when it and two other ships made the first sailing of the Northwest Passage over the top of North America, a route explorers had chased for centuries.Storis was decommissioned in 2007 and sent to California, and someday, possibly the scrapper.But a group of former crewmembers and Juneau residents have other plans.Joe Geldhof is an attorney and history buff who thinks Juneau's million or so cruise ship visitors are looking for something a little more educational during their visits.“There's a lot of activities for people but they usually cost a lot of money. Then there's of course shopping down here,” he said.Geldhof helped form the non-profit Storis Museum, with the goal of someday taking possession of the vessel and permanently docking it in the state capital.But it could take a few years.“There's a little bit of friction back in Washington about Alaska and we've been trapped in sort of never-never land with that,” Geldhof said.The concept of the federal government handing over money, or in this case, assets, to states, is not exactly popular these days among some members of Congress who see the Storis project as pork.Lawmakers dropped a provision this past October which would have sent the vessel north.The Storis Museum says it's not giving up. They say it's only a matter of time and point out they even have the Coast Guard on their side.“Wouldn't that be great if we could get the Storis to come to Juneau?  It'd be wonderful. I hope it can be done,” said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Chris Colvin.Stories don't always end the way people would like, but the Storis is not finished yet.The Storis Museum says if all goes right, they could give the first tours in 2013, but realistically they say it's looking more like 2014.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The clients wanted to see them. Wilson asked his crew member where she'd seen them before setting off. He approached another vessel and tried to move out of its way when whales breached within 10 yards of his boat.Biro found the incident wasn't intentional but that Wilson should've been more careful.(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Ship Creek Ave. -- for one hour Thursday evening, beginning at 6:30 p.m. They’ll also be available during regular derby hours, from 6 a.m. Friday until the derby’s end at 11:30 a.m. June 17.Unlike previous years, derby tickets will be free but limited to one per entrant, with a suggested donation of $20. The soup kitchen says it costs $50 per person per month to provide lunches on weekdays.The soup kitchen opted not to hold the derby in 2011 after a five-year run, instead focusing its efforts on this year’s derby as well as plans for a new facility.More than 20 prizes for the largest fish landed are available, ranging from a 14-foot boat with outboard motor and trailer for first place to gift cards at the Moose’s Tooth restaurant and Holiday gas stations for 20th place. A special prize for the largest fish landed by an active-duty military member includes $500 in cash, a rod-and-reel combo, and a gift certificate for rental of a cabin or yurt at Alaska state parks.Derby officials say entrants must have both a ticket and a fishing license before fishing. Caught fish, along with proper harvest documentation filled out at the water’s edge, should be brought to the Derby Shack for weighing from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. (or 6 a.m. to noon on June 17).(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Most of those deaths occur in December, January and February, when high snow and concentrations of forage make moose more likely to travel on or near cleared roads.“Moose movements around roadways are unpredictable; animals can dart suddenly across lanes, cross and double back, or appear seemingly from out of nowhere,” officials wrote.Fish and Game’s Anchorage area biologist, Jessy Coltrane, confirms the recent spike in reports of injured moose, which follows the familiar annual upswing.“We’ve seen more calls in the last month, which is pretty typical since it’s so dark,” Coltrane said.While car-moose crashes pose a risk to drivers and their vehicles, Coltrane says Fish and Game’s involvement often begins in their wake.“We usually don’t get called on a collision, we get called on the aftermath,” Coltrane said. “If we get called to a moose with a broken leg, 90 percent of the time it’s caused by a car.”According to Coltrane, Fish and Game has responded to about one or two injured moose per week, with calls about moose on the rise but officials sometimes receiving multiple calls about the same moose.Fish and Game offers drivers the following tips to help avoid vehicle-moose collisions:•         Reduce your driving speed on highways and when visibility on the sides of the road is restricted.•         Deliberately and continuously scan for wildlife on both sides of the road and along road corridors and medians.•         Increase the distance between you and the car in front of you to allow for greater braking distances and reaction time.•         Watch for signs marking known moose crossing areas and be especially alert for a few miles before and beyond those areas.•         Watch for flickering in the headlights of oncoming traffic that may be caused by an animal crossing in front of that vehicle.•         Cow moose crossing or standing near roads are often accompanied by calves, so reduce speed when moose are spotted and look for additional animals that may be crossing behind the first.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

An urgent marine information broadcast, asking mariners for assistance in finding the crewman from the 34-foot fishing vessel Swift, has also been issued.According to the Associated Press, a deck hand on the Swift fell overboard, prompting the skipper -- the vessel's only other crew member -- to launch a skiff, before he also fell overboard.“Coast Guard Sector Juneau command center watchstanders received a relayed report of distress from the crew of the 57-foot fishing vessel Pacific Horizon just after midnight,” DeVuyst wrote. “The Pacific Horizon crew had rendezvoused with the Swift, found no one aboard and notified the Coast Guard.”The Jayhawk’s crew found the skipper on a beach near an overturned skiff Tuesday morning, suffering from mild hypothermia. DeVuyst says he was taken directly to Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau for treatment.“Right now, our No. 1 priority is locating the missing man,” DeVuyst said.According to the Coast Guard, the missing man was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and black rain pants. Weather conditions in Icy Strait include light winds, calm seas, and water temperatures of 60 degrees.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Truman rescue a sea turtle that was tangled in a makeshift fishing net.<COL>WTKR/U.S. NavySailors assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman rescued a sea turtle that was tangled in a makeshift fishing net last week."They called away, 'man the port davit,' because a lookout saw some containers attached to a net in the water, and there was a sea turtle trapped in it," said Lt. j.g. Lillian Bean, who served as the boat officer for the rigid-hull inflatable boat used in the rescue.Seaman Madison Allen said the turtle was tangled in a makeshift fishing net built out of jugs, metal wire, hooks and netting."The netting and wire were wrapped around the turtle's fin," Allen said. "People put these types of traps together to catch fish, and the turtle ended up getting caught."A lookout noticed the jugs start bobbing up and down in the water on Nov. 7, signaling something had been caught."He looked tired and stressed," Bean said of the turtle. "I really wanted to save this turtle and not leave him out there."Bean said they couldn't put anyone in the water because of the size of the turtle, how tangled it was and the potential hazard to a rescue swimmer, so they used a boat hook to pull the entangled turtle closer to the side of the inflatable boat so they could work on freeing it.The turtle didn't make it easy, but eventually was able to swim free."In the Navy, we always strive to be good stewards of the environment," commanding officer Capt. Bob Roth said. "As professional mariners, we are obligated and take great pride in helping those fellow mariners in need. ... The smiles and excitement of the boat crew after they returned to the carrier were infectious, it was an uplifting experience."No email address was supplied by.

As a self-described “outdoorsy girl” she is most comfortable in wide open spaces. She says she loves Nome because she is able to drive out to the family’s fish camp and live off of the land.While she doesn’t like to complain because someone always has it a little harder, Nome does have some downsides. She says the high cost of living is a challenge to living in Nome.“My co-worker has a family of four and a husband and she spends $2,500 dollars a month on food,” Tahbone said. “I was just appalled because I go through a measly $500-$600 a month with food. Holy cow I just couldn’t believe it.”She doesn’t enjoy the Iditarod as much as she used to when she was younger, when she and her brothers would collect the dog’s booties as the mushers pulled into Front Street.“We were so proud to collect those dog booties from the Iditarod dog mushers because they were so mysterious to us as kids,” she said. Tahbone works for the Kawerak regional corporation as a wellness coordinator. Tahbone is happy to be giving back to her community that has shown her so much support, even throwing a community potluck for her before she left for college at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.She said by participating in the One Alaska program she hopes to gain knowledge of other places around the state and hear what other people think about other parts of Alaska.No email address was supplied by.

He says what people might know him for this most is taking pictures. But his everyday job is as a school bus driver. He says he’s been told “the kids love me on the bus because I treat them fairly. I’m not Mr. Mean bus driver.”He says he tries to teach the kids how to be kind, because if you teach them young they will be nice the rest of their lives. But Joe Joe does say some children are disrespectful in Bethel.“I’ve noticed living here these kids nowadays don’t have any respect at all. Not like the old days where everyone respected each other, but it’s a free for all for the kids,” Prince said.He says the kids complain there is nothing to do, but according to Joe Joe, that’s far from the case. He suggests they go help an elder, go fishing, go boating, go for a bike ride or do what he does and take pictures.Joe Joe also made a promise to himself a long time ago that he wouldn’t drink, and he’s kept true to that promise. He says the worst part of living in Bethel is the overuse of drugs and alcohol. And while some are fighting a hangover, Prince loves “going boating and fishing so their loss, I’ll go catch the fish.”During his free time when he’s not snapping pictures you can find Prince behind the grill. He says he loves the compliments he gets from friends about his barbecue skills.“Bethel is special," Prince said. “That’s part of the reason why I’m so friendly with everyone. Make them feel welcome here. Someone has to be the nice guy here.’No email address was supplied by.

He says there were about 400 full-time residents then. Now there are more than 4,000.“The quality of life in this community is great. It’s a great place for families now,” Kelty said. “We have many of the residents that started out as seasonal and now make their homes here.”But Unalaska is a bit removed from the rest of the state, with limited ferry service and expensive transportation options. Housing costs are also a concern, as are fuel costs, and the cost of living.Kelty says the community does a great job of managing the fishery in the area.“I think we’ve been blessed to have excellent management on the federal and state side,” he said. Kelty says he was there when the town went through the crab boom and bust in the early 80’s.“Unalaska was devastated,” he said. “We were a one-horse town in those days.”He says when the ground fish industry started in 1986 it brought new vitality to the community.To Kelty, Unalaska is unlike any other place you will ever visit. It has rich Aleut culture, weather extremes, and beauty not like many other places.No email address was supplied by.

And then what we're going to be doing, pulling line off our reel: mending it upstream, pick that line up then here, set the hook on it. So we're out here, throw that mend upstream -- see that?”Tornow makes it look simple, but my first cast shows that I’m a little out of practice.“It's a good thing we have you coming out here early, Kari -- you don't remember anything from what I told you last time,” Tornow said.Tornow’s partner, Lee Kuepper, helps break casting positions down with a domestic metaphor.“Think of it like this, so you start with your cast on the table -- bring it back to the ceiling, then poke it at the window,” Kuepper said.The fishing is a little slow after the big weekend rush, so we decide to spend the rest of the day on technique. Kuepper grabs the line from my rod and reel, tugging on it to demonstrate the advantages of keeping the rod relatively low.“If you’re up like that really high, with your rod tip up, you’re doing all the work and you’re hardly getting anything happening to me because the rod’s absorbing all that pressure,” Kuepper said. “But if you reel down a little bit and then fight it within that 45 degrees, you’re actually bending the butt of that rod right there – see how it’s bending all the way even towards the cork? So when you’re fighting the fish you want to make sure you maintain that 45 degrees, even when you’re fighting one.”Despite the bite being off, it feels good to get back in the water. So even though we struck out this time, we're now in prime form for the summer ahead."At least you can come down here, work on your throw, get out by the river, have some basic fun -- learn something new as well,” Tornow said.Most of this week’s catching is being done south of Anchorage, with halibut and rockfish being caught in Whittier. Clams are showing up in Ninilchik, and Homer has been producing halibut and feeder kings.For more information on state fishing restrictions and statewide statistics, visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s website for regional outlooks.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That's because the other two are city slickers -- but Kari Bustamante is out to change all that with an ill-advised attempt to lure Charlie Sokaitis into the water.Dipnetters line the coast along Portage every evening, hauling in hooligan by the dozens.With that kind of projected success, I thought, “Could this be? A fishing trip easy enough for even Charlie Sokaitis?”Charlie got the net a little wet -- but felt consulting the locals might help his chances.“I wanna catch some fish -- do you have any advice for me?” Sokaitis asked local angler Peter Loza.“The thing is, right now when you're at low tide, the fish like to come in against the rocks -- you don't have to go out there very far,” Loza said. “They like to deposit their eggs around here, so get in a rocky area.”According to Loza, high tide brings higher returns of fish with it.“When the tide starts coming up, the fish start coming in faster with the tide ‘cause they are all headed up that way, heading into 20 Mile (River), because that’s their little habitat up in there,” Loza said. “Sometimes you'll be lucky, you'll come out here and just kill them -- it's just hit and miss with these guys.”For his part, Charlie was philosophical on his chances of catching anything.“As I am zero for life on fishing, one would be a tremendous victory,” Sokaitis said.Charlie is starting to figure out how little faith I have in him, based on nearby anglers’ supplies.“I think the difference in confidence is, you brought a barrel, and we brought nothing to store the fish in,” Sokaitis said.Unfortunately, Charlie couldn't land anything before time expired, despite my attempts to apply some pressure by threatening to bring him back if he didn’t land a fish.“Oh, great -- some sort of corporal punishment,” Sokaitis said.As for this week's fishing hot spots, if you’re feeling impatient, the only reliable catch is still out in the ocean.Whittier is great for halibut, with tons of black bass being caught as well.Homer is also good for the flatfish, as well as winter kings.If you want to take a chance, Deep Creek is also producing kings.Lake fishing is slow to non-existent, but we hear Echo Lake is really picking up for trout fishing.For more information on state fishing restrictions and statewide statistics, visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s website for regional outlooks.Contact Kari BustamanteCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

She is believed to have been 98 years old.John was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that strengthened Native subsistence fishing rights in Alaska. The case was decided in John's favor in 1994 after the Alaska Board of Fisheries refused to allow her and another elder, Doris Charles, access to a fish camp in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve that had been abandoned in the 1960s.John prevailed in the case, which became one of the most important chapters in the history of subsistence rights in Alaska.Sen. Mark Begich issued a statement Friday honoring John and her life’s work.“Alaska has lost a steadfast advocate for Native subsistence rights,” Begich said. “From her fish camp on the Copper River, Katie John gave Alaska Natives across our state a voice to their long-sought protection of traditional hunting and fishing rights. While Alaskans mourn her passing, Katie John’s legacy will live on as I and others work to ensure these rights are upheld.”In a separate statement, Sen. Lisa Murkowski praised John's willingness to stand up to authority, at both the state and federal level."She was unafraid to challenge any bureaucrat standing between her Native people and their opportunity to fish, whether that was a State of Alaska that didn’t recognize that ANILCA’s rural preference included fishing or a National Park Ranger trying to tell her that she couldn’t fish from her ancestral village within the Wrangell-St Elias National Park," Murkowski said. "Katie John’s life was that of an authentic Alaskan. It is my sincere hope that in the loss of culture bearers like Katie we have not lost forever a piece of Alaska’s soul."Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed to this story.No email address was supplied by.

By reporting lower weights, crews could process more fish than their federally allowed quota.In one extreme case from 2007, a federal fishery observer aboard the company's American Dynasty found that fish weighing 238 pounds registered as only 73 pounds -- off by nearly 70 percent.The company says it's cooperating with NOAA and takes its commitment to sustainable fishing practices seriously.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"I had difficulty getting to class."The program's 26 staff members are committed to getting students up to speed, and try to remove barriers -- including transportation -- that impede students' success."If they can get to a central location, we cab them the rest of the way," said Hathaway. "We call those families and let them know that you are really close to graduation, and if you take the summer intensive class you're going to meet your goal to graduate."Foster, who's taking Alaska studies and two English classes that will give him one and a half credits, says he's learning that that goal is finally possible."There's a lot of people that don't graduate on time for different reasons, and they do deserve some chance to get a jump start on it," Moore said.The program has been going on for eight years, and 170 students from grades 9 through 12 are now enrolled. Program officials say eight, including Foster, are currently on track to graduate.Contact Corey Allen-YoungFriend Corey on FacebookFollow Corey on Twitter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Instead she chose to raise her children and spend her years giving back to the state. Smalley moved to Alaska 43 years ago to teach in a Yup’ik village along the Kuskokwim River. It was only supposed to be a three month gig, but she was hooked.“We had spent a day in the Kenai and if you’ve traveled in the Kenai at all you know it’s an alluring place,” Smalley said. “So we packed it all up and we came here.”Susan retired from teaching and now spends her days volunteering. Three days a week you will find her in prison, where she runs classes on knitting. Susan also volunteers at the hospital where she and others sit with people who are dying and don’t have any family. She also does hand massages and healing touch.Susan says living in the Kenai does mean it garners more attention because of its resources. “Oil and gas has become this huge economic factor that has to be cultivated and sometimes that’s for good and sometimes I’m not sure it’s so good to be so popular,” she said. “We also have fish so sometimes people pay attention to us for those kinds of characteristics and that makes it a bit of a challenge, because those resources are now renewable.”She says the dipnet fishery makes the peninsula sink a little lower during July, because of the “frantic pace.”“I love the beaches here. I appreciate eating fish but I’m not willing to go and duke it out with people over fish,” Smalley said. “Fishing has lost its appeal to me.”For Susan living in a smaller town in Alaska has great benefits. Kenai is the largest city she has ever lived in. She says it has everything she could possibly need, without being too big.No email address was supplied by.

BNC shared its opposition to proposal 38, which would repeal the state non-subsistence areas. It also opposed proposal 39, which would reduce the size of the Fairbanks non-subsistence area."These proposals are in conflict with the state subsistence regulations requiring the joint boards to establish the boundaries of non-subsistence areas," Hoffman said.Hoffman stated the BNC also opposes proposals 40 and 41 that would turn Kodiak and Bethel into non-subsistence areas, which could hurt those communities."These proposals are an attempt to undermine subsistence protections," Hoffman said.  "The proposals are non-productive and have no basis for consideration."Orville Huntington, a Board of Fisheries member, says subsistence proposals are controversial just about every time they are introduced."Whether they're from a rural area or an urban area and they care about their community and how they fish and trap and gather, I can see how they would want to protect those rights," Huntington said. "We're just here to try to make the regulations easier for everyone."The joint meeting is scheduled to last for five days.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

According to Mosley, NMFS has yet to determine whether the boaters will be formally notified that they violated federal halibut subsistence laws.Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Megan Peters says no state charges have been filed in the incident as of Friday, which meant she couldn’t comment on it.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Channel Two is looking back at three Alaskans and their families who have paid the ultimate price.On May 10, The State of Alaska recognized Peace Officers Memorial Day. It’s a somber yet iconic event to mark and mourn Alaska’s law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This year the annual event was organized by State Trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters. For Peters it's more than just a work assignment, it's personal.“My dad was a fish cop, fish and wildlife. So he was a brown shirt,” Peters said.Peters said growing up she always knew her father did important work with the Alaska Troopers – sometimes even dangerous work – but as a child she didn’t focus on the dangers of the job.“He would go out on the boat all the time. He loved flying,” Peters said. “People say yeah, it's something that you know could happen but I was a little kid, and my dad was a trooper the whole time, so why would something happen?”When Peters was just 18-years-old something did happen. Her father was flying on a routine sport fishing patrol near Iliamna when his plane crashed. It was May 25, 2001. Megan was studying abroad in Finland when her mother called with the news.“I was just walking down the street, and I’ll never forget the first thing she said was ‘I’m so sorry Megan,’” Peters said. “I don't remember anything after that phone call. I don't remember packing. I didn't have to change my plane tickets because I was already leaving. I just came home, and it was a different life.”It was a life without a father who had meant the world to her.“When he wasn't working he was always taking us out. We had a boat and we had our own plane in high school,” Peters said. “My dad loved Alaska and that's why he came up here. He came up with the intent on wanting to be a State Trooper.”James Arthur Moen was a productive Alaska State Trooper. For 18 years he served The State of Alaska. A member of the Special Emergency Response Team, SERT and dive unit, Moen assisted in numerous rescues and recovery missions.Today, he is still remembered for his contributions across the state. A trooper boat is named after Moen and still operates out of Petersburg.While serving Alaskans, Moen also served as a strong role model for his daughter. She decided to follow in her father's footsteps and is now working with the State Troopers.Peters joined the Troopers in 2007 where she is tasked with writing a press release each time a plane crashes in Alaska and troopers respond. Just like her father's hat that sits on her desk in the office, each press release serves as a constant and often painful reminder of the high cost of duty.“I might not understand what it is that the troopers are doing every single day and what they're facing but I grew up around it enough to know what their jobs do entail,” said Peters, “and to know what it's like to be in that environment.”Alaska Peace Officers Memorial Day serves as a stark reminder of the life and death situations law enforcement officers face every day while on duty. The harsh realities that come along with the responsibilities of duty in Alaska can mean it’s possible they may not come home.Moen’s name was added to this memorial more than a decade ago and joins many like it.This year 40-year-old State Trooper Tage Toll of Talkeetna had his name added. He died only two months ago when Helo-One crashed while executing the rescue of a stranded snowmachiner. Village Public Safety Officer Thomas Madole also had his named added to the memorial this year. He was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call in Manokotak. All the names added serve as a reminder of the lives sacrificed for a job, country and state they loved.“My dad was a trooper and a pilot and he loved both, and you could see it every day when he came home,” Peters said. “He was happy, he loved his life.”Contact Mallory PeeblesCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

These islands never cease to amaze," instructor Connor Gallagher said, according to the news release.The oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet, is a deep-water pelagic fish — the longest bony fish in the world, Chace said. It's very rare to see so close to shore, he said."It's one of these rare weird things you see in Southern California," Chace said.The fish is believed to dive more than 3,000 feet, and in part because of the deepwater habits, little is known about them, Chace said.Children at the camp and the self-professed "science nerd" employees were able to get a good look at the fish, which had been pulled up onto the beach at Toyon Bay, Chace said.Now CIMI is trying to figure out what to do with the silvery fish's body. The program has been in touch with a "fish guru" at UC Santa Barbara and with the Museum of Natural History in LA, Chace said."We can't even really fit it into our freezer," he said.The scientists may decide to bury the carcass and let it decompose under the sand. In the end, they'd have an 18-foot long skeleton to show for their unexpected discovery.No email address was supplied by.

They multiplied, and this year, they gave birth to a bumper crop of babies, which has meant fawns everywhere. Sadly, not so adorable as the summer has stretched on, proving hot and dry. These brutal conditions aren't just fodder for wildfires. They're also hard on vegetation, with few trees, shrubs, and plants thriving in the high heat, low water conditions.That's a devastating consequence for deer, who are struggling to find something to eat, and it's bad news for your garden. The more limited the pickings, the bolder the deer are going to become, and these garden marauders can devastate a beautiful flower or vegetable garden in a single night. Not only that, they can wreak havoc on established trees and shrubs that took years to get going.You don't want that to happen to you! And unless you have the money to establish a good deer fence, you may be struggling to come up with ways to protect your garden from deer. Deer fences need to be at least eight feet high to present a real barrier for jumping, although fences made from solid materials like slats can be shorter, down to six feet. (Deer see solid fences as more of a barrier because it's hard for them to tell what is on the other side, and they can be dissuaded from leaping over the fence.)If you don't have the money for that in your budget right now, it doesn't mean that your garden is at the mercy of the neighborhood ungulates, or that you need to sit on the porch with a shotgun waiting for them to prowl around. (In fact, please don't: it's important to respect the dates of hunting season and it's probably not legal for you to fire a shotgun in your neighborhood. Contact your local fish and game department for specific information about hunting.)First things first: cage your plants. Yes, we know it looks ugly, and there's something singularly depressing about walking out into the yard and seeing an array of plants in tragic little cages. However, those tacky cages are going to save your plants from being nibbled. Save them for those trees and shrubs you want lasting a good long time, and don't worry: once those plants are established (and grown beyond deer height), you can uncage them.Lots of hardware and nursery suppliers sell cages for this purpose, but you can make your own just as easily with chicken wire or deer wire, and they will be much less expensive. Purchase a big roll and cut a length to size, using garden stakes to hold it up around the tree. If you really hate the look of cages, consider just applying them overnight, which is when deer do the most damage. There's no guarantee your plants won't get munched during the day, of course, but the risk is much lower.Second: make your garden less appealing to deer. And I'm not talking about "deer-resistant" plants -- it's too late for that this year. But there are some things you can do now. For one thing, deer aren't too into clutter, because it makes them worry about how they'll escape in a hurry. Strategically move pots, wheelbarrows, garden statues, logs, and anything else you have handy around to turn the garden into an obstacle course. Not so easy to meander around the buffet now, deer!Third: smell-o-vision. Deer don't like hanging out in spots where predators do. And you can actually buypredator urinefor scattering around the garden to deter deer, but that might not be something you're willing to do. However, there are deer repellants (and cheap beer can work too) that you can apply around the garden. Be aware that you will need to keep using them for them to be effective, and remember to check the packaging to make sure they are nontoxic.Add some smelly herbs in containers, too. Sage, chives, peppers, and other pungent herbs are really useful for cooking, and they're also great deer repellants. The strong scent is unappealing, and you can scatter the containers around the garden to keep the deer at bay, moving them as necessary in response to changes in deer activity.Fourth: harvest, harvest, harvest. Deer love juicy, flavorful fruits and veggies. Harvest them as quickly as they appear, and clear away growth when crops are no longer producing. Also keep grass trimmed so deer have nowhere to bed, as this will encourage them to move along. If you have wild blackberries or other fruit around the garden, clip them back and keep them clipped to further deter deer.Fifth: cut loose with moving garden art. Finally, the moment you've been waiting for! Windsocks, windmills, and other garden art that moves around spooks deer, because they're afraid of the movement and they aren't sure what it means. Strategically place some items around the garden to keep deer on their tiptoes, and hopefully tiptoeing right on out of your garden. Motion lights can also be effective for scaring deer at night, but check the aim of the beam carefully so it won't disrupt you and your neighbors.Inevitably, you're going to lose some growth to deer this year, but you don't have to lose it all.Source: http://www.networx.com/article/keeping-deer-out-of-the-gardenDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Belkofski's last permanent residents left the village in 1982, Mack said.Mack said all the remaining buildings except the school had been destroyed by the fire.The corporation has been able to fly over the village to assess the damage, but has not been able to get to the village, accessible only by boat, to do a ground assessment or determine how the fire started.Photos from above show a large blackened area around the village, with just the school building remaining.Seven or eight homes had remained standing before the fire. One had been kept up for use by bear hunters who were allowed by the corporation to hunt on the land, Mack said.The area was also used by nearby residents for subsistence activities like fishing and berry picking.Mack said the Belkofski church, which had fallen down in years past, and the cemetery were also destroyed in the fire.According to the State of Alaska's Community Database, Belkofski's last residents took icons and the bell from the church to establish a new Orthodox church in King Cove, where many former residents live.Mack says the corporation is hoping to be able to find out how the fire started once they're able to reach the village when the weather clears up.Contact Kortnie Horazdovsky(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

You can provide healthy meals for your family for cheap.<COL>iStock/YinYangMost people have two similar goals -- to save more money and lose more weight.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap. If you want another layer of protection, use a water filter. A $7 Brita filter cleans 40 gallons of water.Sure, a cup of water doesn't taste like a cold Coke, and sometimes you need that drink. But it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of your diet. Make the bulk of your fluid consumption water and have soda as an occasional treat.No. 4: Watch the adsGrocery stores do a great job of letting you know when they have sales. Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No. 2: Buy frozen fruits, vegetablesNo email address was supplied by.

On Thursday, they took them up again.The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act or ANILCA and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act or ANCSA include federal protections for rural Alaska.Decades after being signed into law, interested parties discussed how effective the legislation has been at protecting the people who depend on subsistence practices. “In most cases when it comes to meeting the necessities of life, the federal agencies have forgotten the promises made under these laws,” said Craig Fleener with the Alaska Department of Fish & Game.ANILCA includes language giving subsistence users preference over the state’s natural resources, a provision at odds with Alaska’s constitution which says it’s resources belong to all people equally."It really is a human rights issue, it's a food security issue and we need to.... there's a reason why Title VIII of ANILCA has rural preference in place,” said Ana Hoffman with the Bethel Native Corporation.As federal legislation was reviewed, subsistence users worked to educate lawmakers on the importance of wildlife in Alaska and that access to it remains protected.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Stair risers are often ignored, but they are the perfect canvas for a style statement. Whether you paint the risers, or cover them with found objects, or if you tile or carpet them, you can enhance the style of your house. Whatever style you're going for, whether it is classic, farmhouse, or industrial chic, decorating your staircase's risers will reinforce the style. It's also an awesome way to add harmonizing colors to your design scheme.Oak stained wood stair treads and slate tile risers:The coordinating colors of this beautiful staircase design, tiled by DIYAtlanta tile installerAna M., give an earthy edge to a classic interior. It took Ana two weeks to stain and tile her stairs, and the results are impeccable. Dark slate contrasts with light stained treads. Try a look like this if you want a classic staircase with a little bit of flavor.Sisal stair runner:The sisal stair runner is straight out of Martha Stewart Living. Perfect for seaside or preppy decor, the sisal stair runner is an alternative to decorating each riser. The light, natural color of sisal evokes sea reeds and sailing. Relatively inexpensive, the toughest part of this project is installation. It's worth hiring aflooring carpenterto do a neat, polished job of installing the carpet. The lasting impact of a durable sisal stair runner is worth the cost of labor.Eclectic reclaimed stairs and risers:Gosh dang it, these reclaimed stairs and risers are some of the most inventive we've seen. Constructed by one of our favorite bloggers, Funky Junk Interiors, the stairs I've linked to are literally made of reclaimed vintage wooden crates, and found wood scraps like yard sticks. They look downright magical! Stairs, or just risers, made from reclaimed materials give the structure of the house (not just the furnishings) a rambling country vibe that can't be ignored. If you want to make your farmhouse style house look authentic, add a dimension of design with reclaimed stair risers and treads.Custom stenciled risers:As everyone knows, stencils are a fun way to add personality to a wall without breaking the bank. Adding a fine detail stencil design to stair risers takes stair risers from ordinary to statement piece.Modern stencilsare available for the mod set; or go classic for a classic or farmhouse look. Just be sure that the risers are in excellent condition before stenciling. It might be a good idea to sand, prime, and paint them before stenciling for the most polished result.Tile and stain stair risers:Got anEarthshipor a cob cottage? Do you have a ski house in Vermont? Tile and stain stair risers are the perfect earthy look for a rustic cottage. The combination of a reddish stain and neutral colored handmade tiles says Maine fishing house, Vermont ski house, or even New Mexico adobe. A combination of Central American or Mediterranean tile and a bright color of paint could work for a Spanish-style hacienda. One thing is for sure: Stair risers the feature a thoughtful color contrast of tile and paint or stain are high style, and low maintenance.Source: http://www.networx.com/article/ideas-for-creative-stair-risersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Players dying, players suing and on top of that my peers are just going off on you in the media," Ochocinco said, referring Junior Seau's suicide and mounting number of ex-players suing the NFL over brain injuries. "It does not help that ESPN has all of a sudden become Medical TV with damn near every brain expert on the planet. This has got to be the worst week ever. Since no one is showing any support, I figured I would be the first."The NFL has been criticized by current players for its stiff fines for major hits while better handing of concussion and player safety."Y'all do a darn near perfect job at portraying this game as one played by heroes. But let's be real dad," wrote Ochocinco, who has often referred to Goodell as "dad." "This is a nasty, dirty and violent game with consequences. Sign up or go get a regular job. Watch it or turn off the TV and go fishing with your kids. It is really that simple.""I know there are probably legal and financial implications that prevent this blunt depiction, but (I) am not sure if you have a choice," Ochocinco added. "If you don't say it now, the mounting evidence being revealed publicly will say it for you very soon."Sports XchangeNo email address was supplied by.

"It would eat any smaller gator. It snapped up the soccer ball at the water's edge, and it could easily snatch a dog or a small child."Carinus said the gator ate just about anything that crossed its path.To read the original storyclick here.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

He leads points leader Jimmie Johnson by 20 points and third-ranked Kasey Kahne by 50 points.<COL>Caren Firouz/Reuters2 BRAD KESELOWSKI, DodgeTeam: Penske RacingWHERE HE STANDS: Brad Keselowski climbed back into first place in the standings with one race to remaining in the season. He leads points leader Jimmie Johnson by 20 points and third-ranked Kasey Kahne by 50 points.HOMESTEAD RECORD: 4 career starts, 0 wins, 0 top-5s, 0 top-10s, 0 poles. Best career finish: 13th in 2010. Finished 20th in this race last year.LOOKING AHEAD: There are three scenarios for Keselowski to assure himself his first Sprint Cup championship in Sunday's season finale: He must finish 15th or higher, or 16th and lead at least one lap, or 17th and leads the most laps led (even if Johnson wins the race). Here are Keselowski's thoughts on Sunday's race: "Having a legitimate shot to win the championship this weekend is something that I take great pride in because I know we got there together. Everything about this team is first-class, from our owner to our facility to our sponsor, Miller Lite. We have everything we need to be a championship contender for years to come and it's exciting to be a part of that."LOOKING BACK: Keselowski led 10 laps at Phoenix and looked like he could potentially earn a top-five finish, but ultimately settled for a sixth-place showing.ETC.: Keselowski has completed 99.8 percent (1,066) of the 1,068 laps contested in his four career Cup starts at Homestead. His average start is a mediocre 20.2, while his average finish is also 20.2. He has 0 DNFs there.48 JIMMIE JOHNSON, ChevroletTeam: Hendrick MotorsportsWHERE HE STANDS: Jimmie Johnson fell from first to second place after Phoenix. He trails points leader Brad Keselowski by 20 points heading into Sunday's season finale at Homestead. He leads third-ranked and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kasey Kahne, who is out of the running for the championship, by 30 points.HOMESTEAD RECORD: 11 career starts, 0 wins, 4 top-5s, 7 top-10s, 2 poles. Best career finish: second in 2004 and 2010. Finished 32nd in this race last year, his second-worst career performance there.LOOKING AHEAD: If Johnson is to win his sixth career Sprint Cup championship, the formula is fairly simple: he must finish at least 18 positions higher than Brad Keselowski. That's why a win is so important for Johnson, who has never won at Homestead, one of the few tracks he hasn't reached victory lane. Keselowski can win the title if he finishes 15th or higher, or 16th and leads at least one lap, or 17th and leads the most laps led. Here's Johnson's thoughts on what's on the line Sunday: "My focus is going down there and winning the race. We typically haven't had to have that mentality going into this race, but we have shown we can race for the win. We did it in 2010 against Denny (Hamlin), finished second and won the championship. This 48 Lowe's team can do it again. We have nothing to lose and can gamble and take chances. Brad (Keselowski) doesn't have that luxury. This isn't over. This team never gives up and we don't intend to now."LOOKING BACK: After wins at Martinsville and Texas, Johnson hit the wall at Phoenix, literally, when a tire blew out, sending him into the wall. Johnson finished a disappointing 32nd in the race, and watched the points margin swing from a seven-point lead before Phoenix to a 20-point deficit afterward.ETC.: Johnson has completed 94.9 percent (2,793) of the 2,942 laps completed in his 11 career starts at Homestead. His average start is 17.2 and average finish is 13.5. He has 0 DNFs there.5 KASEY KAHNE, ChevroletTeam: Hendrick MotorsportsWHERE HE STANDS: Kasey Kahne climbed one spot to third in the standings after Phoenix. He trails points leader Brad Keselowski by 50 points, second-ranked Jimmie Johnson by 30 points and fourth-ranked Clint Bowyer by two points.HOMESTEAD RECORD: 8 career starts, 0 wins, 1 top-5, 4 top-10s, 2 poles. Best career finish: fourth in 2006. Finished seventh in this race last year.LOOKING AHEAD: With no chance to win the championship, Kahne hopes to finish the season right where he is now: third place in the standings. "I'm excited to finish off the season strong at Homestead. We usually qualify really well there, and we've had strong finishes the last couple of years."LOOKING BACK: Kahne's Chase chances officially ended at Phoenix, where he finished fourth.ETC.: Kahne has completed 96.2 percent (2,060) of the 2,141 laps contested in his 8 career starts at Homestead. His average start is 7.2, but his average finish is 14.8. He also has 1 DNF there.15 CLINT BOWYER, ToyotaTeam: Michael Waltrip RacingWHERE HE STANDS: Bowyer fell from third to fourth in the standings after Phoenix. He is 52 points behind series leader Brad Keselowski, two points behind third-ranked Kasey Kahne and leads fifth-ranked Denny Hamlin by 10 points.HOMESTEAD RECORD: 6 career starts, 0 wins, 1 top-5, 3 top-10s, 0 poles. Best career finish: fifth in 2008. Finished sixth in this race last year.No email address was supplied by.

An expert lets you know.<COL>Chrysler ImageLarry David, co-creator of the hit TV show "Seinfeld," made millions of dollars from the show before creating his own hit HBO show, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," where he portrays himself."Curb Your Enthusiasm" focuses on how, despite being rich and famous, David is very much an unchanged man. He still wears old sneakers and wrinkly clothes, still has the same gripes about life and still drives a Toyota Prius.David's wife, Laurie, is a prominent environmentalist and got David involved in environmental issues that are frequently explored on the show. For anyone who watches "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and knows David's comedy, the Prius, which is a hybrid, in many ways symbolizes the man himself -- unflashy and eco-friendly.What we drive in many ways makes a statement about who we are. Even trying to avoid making a statement -- like David driving an affordable car despite his millions -- ends up making a statement. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, was one of the richest men in the world, but drove around the same pickup truck for 30 years."That is a statement that (Walton) is making. He wants everyone to know that he is one of the boys," saidCharles Kenny, a psychologist who has worked with many of the major automakers trying to help them understand why consumers choose certain cars. "He's a regular guy, and just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that he thinks of himself as different."One thing that Kenny said has changed over time is the connection and identity drivers get from certain brands.Alfred P. Sloan, who served at various times as president, chairman and CEO of General Motors from 1923 through 1956, devised a hierarchy in the GM family that could serve consumers throughout their lifetime.Chevrolet was considered the entry-level car. As consumers moved up the economic ladder, they could move up from Pontiac to Oldsmobile to Buick to Cadillac, the luxury car. That approach helped make GM one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.But as GM lost its domination of the American market in the 1970s and '80s, other American companies rose up, along with an influx of foreign autos, and muddied the waters of brand identity."Today, you go from a Chevrolet to a Pontiac to a Buick, it's the same vehicle. They've just changed a few of the trinkets on it, nothing substantive," said Kenny. "And that's where the brands started to get killed."What now seems to have replaced brand identity in the mind of the American auto buyer is the type of vehicle they drive. Kenny said drivers now identify themselves more as an SUV driver or sports car driver than they do as a Cadillac driver or a Ford driver."A lot of consumers, when they buy a vehicle, are less concerned about the brand than the category of vehicle," said Kenny. "They tend to make that decision first. There seems to be more emotional intensity there."SUVsAn SUV can mean that you seek adventure and exploration.The SUV originated with the Jeep brand that was used extensively by the Allied forces in World War II. As a result, according to Kenny, the Jeep and other SUVs have come to represent the ability to go anywhere and do anything."My Jeep takes me places I could never go in another car, like off-roading in the desert or off-roading on mountain trails where no other cars go," said Tim Root, who lives in Los Angeles and has owned a Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Cherokee. "No other car could go there, not even an Explorer. The only places that could make it that I've been are Jeep Wranglers. Gas prices may have risen, but my needs haven't changed."Of course, many Jeep or SUV drivers never even take their cars off paved roads, but it is because of the endless potential of the SUV that many drivers buy them."It's because of the possibilities. 'I could if I want to. I could exercise that if I really wanted to or if I needed it.' It does have a very strong emotional benefit," said Kenny.Large SUVsKenny said that large SUVs like the Hummer fulfill the same emotional needs that an SUV does, but multiplied, especially for men."Even if they drive it just to the parking lot and don't get any mud on it, at 6 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday or Sunday it helps fulfill all of their fantasies of being a macho southern hombre who is out there hunting and fishing, doing the manly man stuff that men do," said Kenny.The exaggerated and oversize nature of the Hummer can also lead others to think there is a level of psychological overcompensation involved with the owner."I've thought about this a million times driving down the highway in L.A., Chicago, New York, wherever," saidcomedian Rodney Hoodwhen asked what goes through his mind when he sees a man driving a Hummer. "And I think, 'That guy probably has a girl at home that sits around all day and doesn't do a thing but try and avoid his sexual advances at all times. She's 20, he's 50, and she's trying to dodge him at all times."Sports carsKenny said that drivers of sports cars such as the Corvette are seeking power and control, but mostly control."You will find that Corvette owners are more sensitive and refined than you would think. They're not into hoarding it over other people the way that the Hummer owners are," said Kenny.The other emotional need that can be fulfilled is a desire for immortality."They get real upset if the paint job gets scratched. That's very upsetting to a Corvette owner. They want these things to last forever, and they want to last forever," said Kenny. "They're never going to sell it. In fact, a lot of Corvette owners, when they buy a new Corvette, they keep the other one."Muscle carsMuscle cars are becoming a rarer sight on the roads. GM discontinued the Pontiac Firebird and the Chevy Camaro in 2002, although the Camaro returned in 2009.They and the Ford Mustang have been traditionally identified as the poor man's Corvette because of their cheaper price, but Kenny said it is more complicated than that."The difference is that people who own those muscle cars actually do have an impulse control problem," said Kenny. "Corvette owners have it under control. They do not get speeding tickets. They do not wreck their cars. But the Camaro and Firebird owners, those people are much more likely to be weaving in and out of traffic."Kenny said many muscle car drivers ironically buy the cars as a means to try and control their impulses."But you can see that it doesn't work very well. They have impulses with regard to drinking, sexuality, drugs, addiction and serial marriages," said Kenny.Hood said he more often sees muscle cars in rural and suburban towns."I'm from Peoria, Ill., and when they said there was going to be no more Trans Ams, there were 38 suicides in Peoria," joked Hood. "And Paduka, Ky., had an epidemic of suicides, too."SedansThe difference in sedan drivers is the number of doors. Four-door sedans, according to Kenny, serve a need to be practical and nurturing, while two-door sedans fulfill a need for gender identity, especially with women."'It doesn't fit the type of woman that I am to drive a four-door sedan,'" Kenny said many female two-door sedan drivers say to themselves. "'That's for a woman with a family to drive. I'm a single woman. After all, I'd like to meet a guy and get married someday. If I drive around a beat up four-door sedan, that's not going to happen.'"The idea of the four-door sedan being for older or married people isn't limited to women. Hood, who worked as a car salesman before getting into comedy, said he drives around a 2000 Buick LeSabre that his father gave him."I am the youngest person in America to drive a Buick LeSabre, I think," said Hood, who is 39 and single. “I Googled it, and the next closest person was 117 years old, I'm almost positive. ... It'll put you to sleep. You might as well park that thing in an old folks home, sit in it and die. That’s what it feels like to drive a Buick LeSabre."Pickup trucksKenny said that when pickup truck makers came out with full size versions that included back seats, the identity of the pickup truck as a man's auto started to change, and middle-aged women started driving them."What's going on there, what they're looking for, is this is the strong woman, the independent woman who -- she may be happily married, often she is, she's not a man hater -- but she wants to feel like she can do just about all that there is to do in life and do it by herself."Compact pickup trucks, Kenny said, are viewed by many of their owners, especially men, as an extension of themselves more than other auto owners."It really gives him the flexibility to be that competent male who can do things for himself, his family and his friends," said Kenny.MinivansKenny said that the rise of the SUV gave mothers more options of what to drive at the expense of the minivan. As a result, mothers who continue to drive minivans today tend to be practical and traditional and not bothered the message a minivan sends."Gradually, what sort of emerged is this stigma for some women that a minivan is a mommy's van. 'That limits me to mother. I'm not a woman, I'm just a mother,'" said Kenny. "'If I'm driving a minivan, it says that I'm a mommy, I'm a mom, I'm a mother. I'm not a wife, I'm not a woman, I'm not a lover, I'm not a friend. I'm just a mom.' It's limiting."CrossoversAs a result of the stigma a minivan can carry, crossovers such as the Toyota Rav4 have become autos that mothers are more comfortable with, according to Kenny."I think the crossover offers women the opportunity to have the best of both worlds," said Kenny. "They can have the opportunity to fulfill their roles and yet not feel limited, not feel that people are looking at them in a narrow way and fulfill all the aspects of their gender identity."Luxury carsKenny said people purchase luxury cars for many reasons that all relate to one: the need for status."The need for status always comes into play when we are talking about expensive cars and brands, such as Cadillac and Lexus," said Kenny. "What is status about? It is one of the needs that comprise territorial survival, which is concerned bottom line with the following: 'I occupy territory that you do not!'"Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Finding out whether or not you're compatible with a guy might just be as simple as looking at his dog.Studying your potential mate's "best friend" can help you determine what type of man you are dealing with and whether or not he is your type.Is the measure of your dog-loving man his willingness to take in a needy stray from the pound or is it more important to you that he insists on acquiring only the most prized or valuable breed?Of course, it is not simply the dog that defines a man, but his choices and the reasons he makes them that are noteworthy when deciding to date him. But if you need emergency advice on what to look for, here are five dog breeds (and their men) that are easily analyzed for their date-ability.Golden retriever: Settle down with this stable-minded guyA guy who owns a golden retriever is pretty much guaranteed to be drama-free and stable.This man is ready to settle down. He probably figures he's already got the family dog, so why not just add the family?The man who chooses such a canine is likely pretty down to earth and calm. People with this type of dog usually enjoy a lifestyle that includes taking relaxed walks and just being active in the great outdoors.These dogs are known to be lovable and warm-hearted, just like their owners. Guys with this breed value their devoted companions as much as they value the idea of a shared life. If you are lucky enough to find a guy with a Goldie, snatch him up quickly before someone else does.Pug: Playful, fun-loving menA man who owns a pug can usually be counted on to make a woman laugh.These dogs and their men are usually very social even among strangers. They seem to do well when people are showing them love for all that they add to society with their mere presence.All kidding aside though, men who have pugs are definitely not compensating for anything with the size of their dog -- usually quite the contrary as they have large abilities to bring a smile to their date's face with their playful antics.Pug owners are super approachable and can have a good time all by themselves. A gal is just lucky to be invited along for the fun.Go forth with a guy who owns a pug and you can count on light-hearted amusement and possibly sharing this happy-go-lucky approach to life.Beagle: Say hello to the handy, all-American maleThe owner of a beagle can best be described as the all-American male. This man enjoys the simple things in life such as hunting, fishing and living the dream.These men tend to have an upbeat approach to life and do not sweat the details. They can do things like create furniture from scratch and are also man enough to help you decorate the room containing that furniture.They can do anything they set their minds to and if you end up with a man like this, you will always feel that life is satisfying simply because you're alive.These men love their hobbies but are unafraid to shower you with the bounty that is their life. They can bake artisan bread and in the same day butcher a deer.They love their loyal beagles and probably have the capacity to love you just as much.No email address was supplied by.

You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.<COL>iStock/YinYangThe top things on everyone's to-do lists seem to be eat healthy and save money.However, these aren't just goals to which we should aspire once a year. Everyone would probably agree that we always want to save money and we always want to eat healthy.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap. If you want another layer of protection, use a water filter. A $7 Brita filter cleans 40 gallons of water.Sure, a cup of water doesn't taste like a cold Coke, and sometimes you need that drink. But it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of your diet. Make the bulk of your fluid consumption water and have soda as an occasional treat.No. 4: Watch the adsGrocery stores do a great job of letting you know when they have sales. Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No email address was supplied by.

"We fear we probably lost quite a few ducks and geese through the marsh."Culp said the water began turning muddy Friday morning and the water level rose by several feet. Park visitors also told Culp that they had never seen the water levels so high.The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is monitoring the area, but Culp says the wildlife seem to be doing fine.The Potter Marsh Boardwalk was not damaged by the flooding, but officials say a gravel trail washed away and will need to be replaced.Contact Jessica RidgwayCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"We've pitched together, we've vacationed together, we communicate a bunch during the offseason and during the season. (Halladay) just invited me to go fishing this winter. We've got a real good relationship. It's going to be a lot of fun."Halladay said they had long envisioned such a clash, which marks the first time they will pitch against one another."You know, we've talked about this scenario," Halladay said. "It's something we're both looking forward to. It's going to be a challenge."Although the Phillies owned baseball's best mark with a franchise-record 102 wins this season, anything less than a World Series is considered a disappointment in the City of Brotherly Love.For their part, the Cardinals won 23 of their last 32 to secure the wild card on the last day of the season.No email address was supplied by.

Here are the five grossest toys from the "Me Decade."<COL>There were certainly some top-shelf toys over the years. But while Star Wars toys and Rubik's Cubes are the ones that'll be in the Smithsonian or buried in time capsules, there were a ton of well-loved toys that may have been the second stringers, but were awesome nonetheless.Best of all -- the toy makers used revolt and disgust as their muses.And for some reason -- no matter how gross they were -- moms actually allowed them. In fact, you could see moms in the commercials seemingly endorsing them.While little Billy made his own concoction with the Vomitorium, mom would usually come in his room and make that "Oh, Billy..." look while she rolled her eyes, put his dirty clothes in a basket, and then walked out.Disgusting toys seemed to hit their peak in the 1980s, but they are timeless in their appeal. Just like these five ...No. 5: MadballsMadballs were soft, squishy foam rubber balls that were sculpted to look like monster heads. But they weren't just any monster heads. They may have eye patches, scars, bandages, seeping pus -- you name it.They sported names like "Foul Shot," which was a basketball with worms crawling out of its head and eye sockets; "Oculus Orbis," which was an eyeball; and "Slobulus," which was a drooling monster with its eye hanging out.One of the balls was a head with an exposed brain named "Crack Head." The manufacturer later changed its name to "Bash Brain", because they didn't want there to be some connection between cocaine enthusiast crack heads and Madballs.Madballs reached such popularity that they even spawned video games and a cartoon. In fact, there's even a Madballs game for your iPod.No. 4: Mad Scientist Monster LabKids today are really missing out. Sure, they have their PS3s and iPods, but that really teaches them nothing about torture. In the 1980s, we had an awesome toy called "The Mad Scientist Monster Lab."It's basic function was to let the budding mad scientist learn the basics of hurting things.In the box was a little tank that you filled with "Powdered Monster Flesh Remover." Then you'd mix it with the "Secret Froth Formula" to make a truly B-movie-esque acid bath. Next, using plastic bones, you'd create your monster's skeleton and then apply "Monster Flesh Compound" around the skeleton.When you creation was complete, just give him a bath in the acid and it would strip the flesh right off his skeleton.This was a great toy and probably gave budding serial killers something to do without torturing small animals.No. 3: Queasy Bake Cookerator OvenOnce your creative juices were flowing making and torturing your own monsters, a snack would really take the edge off.Everyone's sister owned an Easy Bake Oven -- and they were surprisingly useful -- if you were into making tiny little cakes with a light bulb.But boys had a problem -- they weren't manful enough.Years later, Hasbro retooled the venerable Easy Bake Oven to make it more boy friendly. They took off all the girly pink plastic and replaced it with blood and an illuminated scary face.In the set were ingredients to make worms, bugs, and brains. So, while your sister was making a little chocolate cake with delightful chiffon frosting, you could make a stack of worms, served with a bleeding brain.No email address was supplied by.

If you have to ask yourself that question, or took a moment before answering, then definitely not.<COL>Cody McCloy/CNNLook at you, all plump and fleshy, with a quickening pulse and body jam-packed with sweet meats. That brain of yours, with the scrumptious gray matter and thinking cap makes certain re-animated corpses crave a dining bib.So what are you to do when the formerly living awaken with a hunger for a little human takeout? Are you ready for the zombie apocalypse?Probably not. If you have to ask yourself that question, or took a moment before answering, then definitely not. In the time it took you to hesitate, even the slowest zombie could pull a dine and dash -- or shamble -- on you.On the upside, you're in luck since most people haven't made the adequate preparations for Z-day.Here's the deal: A zombie can be a member of the walking dead or a barely living victim from a curse, virus, etc., and alternately run or shamble. They can be the creation of stupid humans, angry gods, black magic, mad science, cosmic events or -- as is most often the case -- comic book/sci-fi/horror nerds. But whatever their origin, they are a problem that must be dealt with.But not even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinks the masses are ready for the onslaught of the undead."There are insufficient people prepared for emergencies in the United States," said Rear Adm. Ali S. Khan of the CDC.A multi-credentialed doctor, assistant surgeon general and director of the CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, Khan was behind the zombie preparedness guide the organization published online May 2011.Inspired by zombie-related social media buzz after the Fukushima Daichii nuclear disaster in Japan last March, and released days before Harold Camping's predicted rapture, the preparedness guide is a tongue-in-cheek plan. Its message boils down to the idea that if you're ready for a zombie apocalypse, you're ready for any more likely crisis or disaster. The CDC website received 2 million page views the first week as a result, and the guide went viral.The CDC has also recently partnered with AMC's zombie drama "The Walking Dead" -- based on Robert Kirkman's comic book series -- to utilize clips from the TV show and add helpful tips such as, "Clean water is zombie-free water."Apparently, according to TV Land, another tip to survive the zombie apocalypse is to not work at the CDC, which may have been the last hope for humanity in "The Walking Dead," and went kablooey in a giant explosion at the end of Season One.Khan reminded us, however, that the real deal is "alive and well" and that even in any scenario where the CDC would be blown up, they would have "contingency plans" to make sure they're still addressing public health -- which might be a subtle way of suggesting the government agency has a way cooler underground bunker than we originally thought.Still, being prepared for a zombie uprising isn't the same as surviving, and thriving, in one.Author Max Brooks is the father of zombie survival after he literally wrote the book on it in 2003. Set against recorded attacks throughout history, "The Zombie Survival Guide" gives practical tips on defensive and offensive strategies against the ghouls whether you're at home, in a public space, on the move or living in an overrun world.Brooks goes a step further than the CDC (which he toured in October) and gives an extensive breakdown of weapons and combat techniques for life among the dead, but he still equates a zombie apocalypse to a natural disaster or -- more likely, he said -- a viral outbreak."People prepare for the obvious threat," he said. "It's the ones they underestimate that kill them."Also the author of "World War Z" -- the book about a global undead pandemic which will be released as a film starring Brad Pitt in December -- Brooks gives zombie self-defense lectures that he said remain packed with a diverse crowd of teenagers, middle-aged housewives and other hopeful survivors.As an esteemed member of the advisory board of the Zombie Research Society, (alongside director George A. Romero) Scott Kenemore (author of "The Art of Zombie Warfare"), describes members of the zombie survivalist subculture as "super Boy Scouts" who will be armed head-to-toe and skilled at hunting, fishing and camping."Zombie enthusiasts have been preparing woodland hideouts, remote bunkers and treetop deer stands where they can use their skills to live zombie-free well into the apocalypse," he said. "Accordingly, the zombie apocalypse nerd is likely to be wearing a combination of protective gear to shield against zombie bites, and half the winter section of an REI to facilitate their outdoor survival plans."If you haven't been training since 1968 when "Night of The Living Dead" debuted, or since 2003 when Brooks released his book, there's no need to panic -- even if your name is Barbra and they are indeed coming to get you.For about $100 and a plane ticket to England, you can attend Wish.co.uk's Zombie Boot Camp in Droitwich, Worchestershire, for training with military instructors. Utilizing body armor and weaponry, you learn battle tactics and unarmed combat and sniper skills as you train for an attack on a zombie den. Tea, coffee and light snacks are available for nonzombies to eat during training.A little closer to home for American survivors-to-be is the Run For Your Lives "zombie infested 5k obstacle course race," which advertised on "The Walking Dead" midseason premiere February 12. After launching in Baltimore last October, RFYL is hosting races across the country, with the first of 2012 taking place on March 3 in Atlanta.The American Red Cross and CDC will be present at the race, as will IronE [sic] Singleton ("T-Dog") from "The Walking Dead." And Dr. Khan from the CDC will also be running. He said he plans to stay with a large group of buffers.But really, to survive zombies is to understand zombies. Education is key, and learning the difference between an enchanted Voodoo zombie and flesh-eating monster could be tough for newbies not already prepped.Luckily there are resources such as Ross Payton's "Zombies of the World: A Field Guide to the Undead," which gives a handy visual reference to everything from the Common Gray Shambler to the Nordic Draugr and Chinese Hopping Corpse. He also provides a helpful guide of types of humans not to trust when the dead begin to roam. For the more scientific minded, Harvard psychiatrist Steven C. Schlozman, M.D. has documented the biology of zombies in "The Zombie Autopsies."No email address was supplied by.

After all, the millions of Irish people who migrated to America in the midst of the Great Potato Famine in the mid-1800s help build this nation up into what it is today.St. Patrick's Day is more than just a time to hoist a glass of beer tinted with green food coloring and think about how Ireland has no snakes thanks to, allegedly, St. Patty; it's also a day to celebrate everything Irish.In that spirit, let's count down the five greatest things modern Ireland has exported to America.No. 5: Irish actorsWhere would Hollywood be without the likes of Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell or relative newcomers Michael Fassbender ("Inglorious Basterds" and "X-Men: First Class") and Saoirse Ronan ("Atonement" and "The Lovely Bones")?A lot less entertaining, that's what.Without Ireland's Pierce Brosnan, who would have bridged the Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig eras of James Bond? Without Northern Ireland's Neeson, who would have calmly but menacingly described of his "particular set of skills" in "Taken"? Heck, without Ireland we wouldn't have had "Lawrence of Arabia" (thanks, Peter O'Toole).OK, so we would have had those movies, likely with somebody else filling the roles. But Hollywood and its audiences would have been worse off for it.And don't even get us started on Roma Downey. We don't even want to imagine a world without "Touched by an Angel."No. 4: Claddagh ringsThe Claddagh: It's not just for the Irish any more.That might as well be the motto for the symbol consisting of a crowned heart grasped between two hands. Walk into any Irish gift shop in any mall in America, and it'll be hard to miss.More than 300 years after the ring's origins in a small Irish fishing village just outside of Galway, it's worn far and wide as a symbol of love, friendship and loyalty.But the ring is more than just a history-rich beautiful piece of jewelry, it's also functional. Worn on the right hand with the heart facing out means you're looking for love. Wear it on the same hand but facing inward, and your heart has been "captured."How romantic is that?No wonder Hollywood has latched onto the ring as shorthand for romance, with the Claddagh popping up in movies such as "Leap Year" and TV shows like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."No. 3: Irish musiciansEverybody knows about U2, and rightfully so.Although only two members (Bono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr.) of the quintessential Irish rock group actually hale from the Emerald Isle, the band will forever be associated with Ireland.But the country has given the world many other great musical acts.No email address was supplied by.

He was in the waters off Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, more than 600 miles from where he and two friends had set out to fish 28 days earlier, The Associated Press reported.His two friends died, and he likely owed his survival to a sudden rainstorm, the Ecuadorean coast guard captain who helped nurse Vasquez back to health told the AP.Vasquez told authorities he and his friends  were heading back to his home port of Rio Hato after a day of fishing when the boat's motor failed.Oropeces Betancourt, 24, stopped eating and drinking after two weeks and died on March 10. Three days later, his body began to decompose and Vasquez threw it over the side, according to the AP.The other youth, 16-year-old Fernando Osorio, died on March 15, also apparently of dehydration, sunburn and heat stroke. After three days, Vasquez pushed his other friend's body into the ocean.Out of water, Vasquez told authorities he was near death when it suddenly began to rain and he was able to collect four gallons of fresh water, according to the BBC.He spent the next five days eating raw fish, then he was spotted by commercial fisherman working on a skiff from a mother ship, the Duarte V, the AP reported.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Help Us Reach The Stars. Cheer Our Marlins!"However, what Marlins officials failed to detect was that the first letters of the words in the message spell out "Fishinghurts.com," a Web address that the animal right's organization said brings up a page on PETA's website about cruelty involved in fishing.PETA said the hidden message is an effort to draw attention to the plight of fish, who the group says feel pain and suffer when they're caught on a hook or in a net.On its website, the organization said, "It's much better to choose cruelty-free activities instead -- like, say, watching a baseball game."The Miami Marlins have not commented on the pavement stone campaign.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

An expert lets you know.<COL>Chrysler ImageLarry David, co-creator of the hit TV show "Seinfeld," made millions of dollars from the show before creating his own hit HBO show, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," where he portrays himself."Curb Your Enthusiasm" focuses on how, despite being rich and famous, David is very much an unchanged man. He still wears old sneakers and wrinkly clothes, still has the same gripes about life and still drives a Toyota Prius.David's wife, Laurie, is a prominent environmentalist and got David involved in environmental issues that are frequently explored on the show. For anyone who watches "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and knows David's comedy, the Prius, which is a hybrid, in many ways symbolizes the man himself -- unflashy and eco-friendly.What we drive in many ways makes a statement about who we are. Even trying to avoid making a statement -- like David driving an affordable car despite his millions -- ends up making a statement. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, was one of the richest men in the world, but drove around the same pickup truck for 30 years."That is a statement that (Walton) is making. He wants everyone to know that he is one of the boys," saidCharles Kenny, a psychologist who has worked with many of the major automakers trying to help them understand why consumers choose certain cars. "He's a regular guy, and just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that he thinks of himself as different."One thing that Kenny said has changed over time is the connection and identity drivers get from certain brands.Alfred P. Sloan, who served at various times as president, chairman and CEO of General Motors from 1923 through 1956, devised a hierarchy in the GM family that could serve consumers throughout their lifetime.Chevrolet was considered the entry-level car. As consumers moved up the economic ladder, they could move up from Pontiac to Oldsmobile to Buick to Cadillac, the luxury car. That approach helped make GM one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.But as GM lost its domination of the American market in the 1970s and '80s, other American companies rose up, along with an influx of foreign autos, and muddied the waters of brand identity."Today, you go from a Chevrolet to a Pontiac to a Buick, it's the same vehicle. They've just changed a few of the trinkets on it, nothing substantive," said Kenny. "And that's where the brands started to get killed."What now seems to have replaced brand identity in the mind of the American auto buyer is the type of vehicle they drive. Kenny said drivers now identify themselves more as an SUV driver or sports car driver than they do as a Cadillac driver or a Ford driver."A lot of consumers, when they buy a vehicle, are less concerned about the brand than the category of vehicle," said Kenny. "They tend to make that decision first. There seems to be more emotional intensity there."SUVsAn SUV can mean that you seek adventure and exploration.The SUV originated with the Jeep brand that was used extensively by the Allied forces in World War II. As a result, according to Kenny, the Jeep and other SUVs have come to represent the ability to go anywhere and do anything."My Jeep takes me places I could never go in another car, like off-roading in the desert or off-roading on mountain trails where no other cars go," said Tim Root, who lives in Los Angeles and has owned a Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Cherokee. "No other car could go there, not even an Explorer. The only places that could make it that I've been are Jeep Wranglers. Gas prices may have risen, but my needs haven't changed."Of course, many Jeep or SUV drivers never even take their cars off paved roads, but it is because of the endless potential of the SUV that many drivers buy them."It's because of the possibilities. 'I could if I want to. I could exercise that if I really wanted to or if I needed it.' It does have a very strong emotional benefit," said Kenny.Large SUVsKenny said that large SUVs like the Hummer fulfill the same emotional needs that an SUV does, but multiplied, especially for men."Even if they drive it just to the parking lot and don't get any mud on it, at 6 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday or Sunday it helps fulfill all of their fantasies of being a macho southern hombre who is out there hunting and fishing, doing the manly man stuff that men do," said Kenny.The exaggerated and oversize nature of the Hummer can also lead others to think there is a level of psychological overcompensation involved with the owner."I've thought about this a million times driving down the highway in L.A., Chicago, New York, wherever," saidcomedian Rodney Hoodwhen asked what goes through his mind when he sees a man driving a Hummer. "And I think, 'That guy probably has a girl at home that sits around all day and doesn't do a thing but try and avoid his sexual advances at all times. She's 20, he's 50, and she's trying to dodge him at all times."Sports carsKenny said that drivers of sports cars such as the Corvette are seeking power and control, but mostly control."You will find that Corvette owners are more sensitive and refined than you would think. They're not into hoarding it over other people the way that the Hummer owners are," said Kenny.The other emotional need that can be fulfilled is a desire for immortality."They get real upset if the paint job gets scratched. That's very upsetting to a Corvette owner. They want these things to last forever, and they want to last forever," said Kenny. "They're never going to sell it. In fact, a lot of Corvette owners, when they buy a new Corvette, they keep the other one."Muscle carsMuscle cars are becoming a rarer sight on the roads. GM discontinued the Pontiac Firebird and the Chevy Camaro in 2002, although the Camaro returned in 2009.They and the Ford Mustang have been traditionally identified as the poor man's Corvette because of their cheaper price, but Kenny said it is more complicated than that."The difference is that people who own those muscle cars actually do have an impulse control problem," said Kenny. "Corvette owners have it under control. They do not get speeding tickets. They do not wreck their cars. But the Camaro and Firebird owners, those people are much more likely to be weaving in and out of traffic."Kenny said many muscle car drivers ironically buy the cars as a means to try and control their impulses."But you can see that it doesn't work very well. They have impulses with regard to drinking, sexuality, drugs, addiction and serial marriages," said Kenny.Hood said he more often sees muscle cars in rural and suburban towns."I'm from Peoria, Ill., and when they said there was going to be no more Trans Ams, there were 38 suicides in Peoria," joked Hood. "And Paduka, Ky., had an epidemic of suicides, too."SedansThe difference in sedan drivers is the number of doors. Four-door sedans, according to Kenny, serve a need to be practical and nurturing, while two-door sedans fulfill a need for gender identity, especially with women."'It doesn't fit the type of woman that I am to drive a four-door sedan,'" Kenny said many female two-door sedan drivers say to themselves. "'That's for a woman with a family to drive. I'm a single woman. After all, I'd like to meet a guy and get married someday. If I drive around a beat up four-door sedan, that's not going to happen.'"The idea of the four-door sedan being for older or married people isn't limited to women. Hood, who worked as a car salesman before getting into comedy, said he drives around a 2000 Buick LeSabre that his father gave him."I am the youngest person in America to drive a Buick LeSabre, I think," said Hood, who is 39 and single. “I Googled it, and the next closest person was 117 years old, I'm almost positive. ... It'll put you to sleep. You might as well park that thing in an old folks home, sit in it and die. That’s what it feels like to drive a Buick LeSabre."Pickup trucksKenny said that when pickup truck makers came out with full size versions that included back seats, the identity of the pickup truck as a man's auto started to change, and middle-aged women started driving them."What's going on there, what they're looking for, is this is the strong woman, the independent woman who -- she may be happily married, often she is, she's not a man hater -- but she wants to feel like she can do just about all that there is to do in life and do it by herself."Compact pickup trucks, Kenny said, are viewed by many of their owners, especially men, as an extension of themselves more than other auto owners."It really gives him the flexibility to be that competent male who can do things for himself, his family and his friends," said Kenny.MinivansKenny said that the rise of the SUV gave mothers more options of what to drive at the expense of the minivan. As a result, mothers who continue to drive minivans today tend to be practical and traditional and not bothered the message a minivan sends."Gradually, what sort of emerged is this stigma for some women that a minivan is a mommy's van. 'That limits me to mother. I'm not a woman, I'm just a mother,'" said Kenny. "'If I'm driving a minivan, it says that I'm a mommy, I'm a mom, I'm a mother. I'm not a wife, I'm not a woman, I'm not a lover, I'm not a friend. I'm just a mom.' It's limiting."CrossoversAs a result of the stigma a minivan can carry, crossovers such as the Toyota Rav4 have become autos that mothers are more comfortable with, according to Kenny."I think the crossover offers women the opportunity to have the best of both worlds," said Kenny. "They can have the opportunity to fulfill their roles and yet not feel limited, not feel that people are looking at them in a narrow way and fulfill all the aspects of their gender identity."Luxury carsKenny said people purchase luxury cars for many reasons that all relate to one: the need for status."The need for status always comes into play when we are talking about expensive cars and brands, such as Cadillac and Lexus," said Kenny. "What is status about? It is one of the needs that comprise territorial survival, which is concerned bottom line with the following: 'I occupy territory that you do not!'"Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

It peeled off-line, went about 30 feet out and turned. I thought it was a kingfish or cobia," Faver told the newspaper. "What's weird is that the rod was still bent like he was running out, but I guess he had so much slack in the line from running back at us."Favor said within an instant "there was 5 feet of flying teeth" heading directly toward his head."It just came from nowhere. I ducked. He came over the port side and into the starboard," he said.The incident was caught on tape and posted toYouTube.Favor said although the fish was feisty and seriously angry, he managed to hook it with a gaff as it flailed on deck, and throw it back into the ocean."The whole thing took maybe 20 seconds. It was so fast," Faver said. "In 28 years of charter fishing nothing like that's ever happened to me. And I never want it to happen again."To read the original storyclick here.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

This particular manifestation of depression, he believes, is borne out of the alienation players feel when they leave the game."It's not the depression that kills you," said Jefferson, who was a teammate with the late Junior Seau in San Diego. "It's trying to make that transition to real life without that support group you've had in place your whole career. The depression is a result of not being around your guys any more; that's what kills you."The depression comes about because you don't have that structure any more. You aren't walking into that locker room and chatting with your locker mates. You're not in that fire on Sunday with those guys. You are at the door knocking, but nobody will let you in. You don't have that sense of purpose. For guys who retire, there is a dark side to that transition period."Jefferson speaks from experience. He thought his post-football life would be great. He had saved and invested his money wisely. He had a young family to tend to. He figured he could happily live out his days fishing and, as he put it, "living the salt life."A year into it, he was struggling. The void, the absence of the game and all of its attending structures, became increasingly unbearable for him."I was getting up every day and going fishing," he said. "After a while I was going by myself because my buddies had to work. I would just keep pushing the limits. I would go 50 miles out into the ocean. The next day, I'd say let's go out to where the big boys are and I'd go out 100 miles. But it's not the same. You just can't replace that feeling, that adrenaline rush you get playing the game."The alienation of the retired player, Jefferson said, is similar to what a soldier feels when he's back from combat."People in the outside world don't know what it's like to go into battle with a guy," he said. "Civilians who haven't been to war have no idea what it's like to be in a foxhole with a guy, to depend on that guy to save your life. Basically, that’s what football players do, they depend on each other to save their butts every week. You develop a bond and when you retire, that bond is gone and you crave for it."Jefferson said he was thrown a lifeline, a lifeline he believes the NFL should finance and promote as much as it does player safety issues. He was asked by former Lions coach Steve Mariucci to take a coaching internship."It was by the grace of God that Mooch called me out of the blue," Jefferson said. "I was out of the game a year and he said, 'Hey, what're you doing?' He asked if I was interested in an internship and I jumped at it."This was the rope somebody threw me when I was drowning in high water."He's been the Lions' receivers coach since 2005 and he wishes he could sit down with commissioner Roger Goodell to share some of his ideas. He believes part of the solution is for the league to take measures to keep retired players around the game. He's not saying give them all jobs. He's saying give them access. Establish internships -- coaching, consulting, commentating. Or, more simply, make them feel they are still welcomed, still part of the game."You don't know how much good it could've done if Junior Seau could have stayed around the game," Jefferson said. "If he would have come to my practice on a Monday, I would have told him I have a team meeting on Friday and he had 15 minutes to tell the team anything he wanted. He would have felt important. He would have been on that stage again and everybody would have been in tune with him. He would have been thinking about it all week. Can you imagine what that would have done for a guy like that?"The NFL doesn't get it. They are looking in the wrong places."The Sports XchangeNo email address was supplied by.

"Community groups such as the Girl Scouts help us accomplish our management goals in the refuge by providing a much needed service and allowing us to be more efficient with our limited public funds."Girl Scout Troop 301 leader, Georgia Lee Tolbert. said, "This partnership is a wonderful way for the scouts to give back to their community and helps teach them about responsibility and their role as a citizen in helping direct the management of our resources."Potter Marsh is part of the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge. It is a freshwater marsh in south Anchorage stretching across 564 acres. Each year approximately 130,000 visits are made to the Potter Marsh boardwalk.Contact Jessica RidgwayCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Here in Alaska, on its northern coast, the business is beginning to boom in the village of Kaktovik.<COL>Wild polar bear viewing is a unique industry, limited to very few places on the earth. Here in Alaska, on its northern coast, the business is beginning to boom in the village of Kaktovik.“Very few [tourists] ask about other animals, they're all here to see the polar bears,” said polar bear viewing guide Bruce Inglangasak.Originally from Canda, Inglangasak said he has been offering polar bear viewing tours by boat since about 2002. He said he has brought tourists from all around the world within just feet of the massive polar bears.“First [the tourists] were all scared and then I tell them this is how close we get to [the bears],” Inglangasak said. “They don't bother us, and these are really mellow animals when they're here because they're here for one reason and that's to feed at the bone pile.”Polar Bear Wildlife Biolgist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Susi Miller, said there is no established distance that people must stay away from bears when viewing.“It's based more on the bear’s behavior,” Miller said. “These trained guides -- they know that they can approach in a manner; as long as it’s not changing the behavior of the bear they're fine.”Miller explained currently four people in Kaktovik are licensed and trained to guide polar bear tours. Inglangasak said he knows of about 11 boats that are operating tours.“It does take experience with bears to know how they behave, how they're going to respond to you and every bear it's different,” Miller said. “So we really rely on those guides to get that right.”During fall whaling season in the village the number of bears on shore rises, Inglangasak said. Each year Miller said the number of bears staying on the shores of Kaktovik is rising.“We believe that’s related to ice and their availability to hunt successfully,” Miller said. “When the ice recedes in the summertime most of the bears go with the ice, but if they do remain with the ice, they have less opportunity to hunt seals.”Miller said the polar bears that do come to shore, in places like Kaktovik, are making use of an alternative food source.Inglangasak said during whaling season unused portions of the whale are discarded at the village bone pile for the bears to eat. On a good day during whaling season tourists can see up to two dozen wild polar bears. During September he is completely booked with tours that range from nearly $400 to $550 for a few hours, Inglangasak said.The polar bear viewing business has attracted many tourists to the area and Inglangasak said at first not all of the locals were in favor of the outsiders coming to their village."It was kind of a mixed group but now they're starting to see it's good for our community,” said Inglangasak.Inglangasak said in a few weeks he makes enough money to support his family through the year.Miller said there are about 1,500 polar bears living in the southern Beaufort Sea population. Last year U.S. Fish and Wildelife Service counted more than 80 polar bears. Miller said it is possible that people visiting Kaktovik can see about 8 percent of the that region's polar bear population.Contact Mallory PeeblesCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Known as a fierce competitor on the field, Schmidt began experiencing the frequent and urgent need to use the bathroom nine years ago."I knew once I turned 50 that there would be changes in my body, but I was not prepared for the frequent and urgent need to use the bathroom," explains Schmidt. "It got to the point where going to the bathroom was getting in the way of activities like spending time with my family and hobbies like fishing and golf."At his family's urging, Schmidt spoke to his doctor and was told the constant bathroom breaks weren't just signs of getting older -- they were caused by BPH. After being diagnosed with BPH, Schmidt also learned that it is not cancer. With his doctor's help, Schmidt developed a game plan to manage his symptoms of BPH with Uroxatral (alfuzosin HCl 10 mg extended-release tablets).Understanding that it may be difficult for men to talk about BPH, Schmidt has partnered with Minor League Baseball to help educate men about this common condition through the "BPH Game Plan Starts with U: Catch the Whole Game" program. Schmidt is traveling to cities across the country to speak at Minor League Baseball games about his personal experience with BPH and how, with the help of his doctor, he is successfully managing his symptoms. "I won't be benched by BPH, and I don't want anyone else to be either," said Schmidt."While this may be an uncomfortable subject to address with anyone, talking with your doctor about urinary symptoms is an important first step to effectively manage an enlarged prostate," said Kevin McVary, M.D., professor of urology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Here are the five best.<COL>iStock / StudioStellaThanks to the scantiness of modern swimwear, many beaches in the U.S. seem only a small step away from a nudist colony, but the experience for first-time nude beachgoers is often still shocking.If you're looking to ease your way into the naturist lifestyle, nudist resorts and topless beaches are available that offer a slightly less adventurous experience. However, our top five best nude beaches are the "Full Monty," so proceed with caution!While many of the world's best nude beaches are located outside the United States, there are several beaches across the nation that encourage visitors to bare all. However, not all of these nudist havens are created equal.Whether you're looking to get an even tan, meet people who share your naturalist values, or just let it all hang out, these are America's top five best nude beaches ...No. 5:  Black's Beach - San DiegoWho says size doesn't matter? Located between La Jolla and Torrey Pines, Black's Beach is the largest nude beach in North America and a popular destination for surfers and naturalists.Whether you're looking to ride a big wave or just even out your tan, this nude beach is known for being safe and clean.Nestled against high rock cliffs on the San Diego coastline, Black's Beach is deceptively intimate. However, nude newbies beware, the massive waves and relaxed atmosphere draw large crowds, so be prepared to have an audience.Also be careful to watch for signs at Black's Beach, because not all areas of this sandy hot spot are nudist-friendly.Our next selection is just about the best little beach in the nation ...No. 4: Little Beach - Maui, HawaiiIf you're looking for a place to bare all in America's 50th state, Little Beach at Makena is the place to go.While nudity is not generally allowed on Hawaiian beaches, the courts have agreed to look the other way in the case of Little Beach, making it Maui's unofficial clothing-optional destination. This beautiful strip of sand was a favorite of the hippie population during the 1960s and remains a popular destination for naturalists from all over the United States.The swimming and snorkeling are reported to be sensational at this popular sunbathing spot. However, Little Beach is inaccessible by car, so be prepared to park at Makena (Big) Beach, and hoof it from there.Another insider tip: Take your valuables with you or leave them at home, as theft from cars is common at Big Beach.Next up, go clothing optional -- military style ...No. 3: Gunnison Beach - Sandy Hook, N.J.New Jersey might not seem like the ideal place to drop your drawers, but the nude beach at Sandy Hook draws up to 5,000 sunbathers on any given summer weekend.The beach takes its name from Gunnison Battery, a military fortress built by the government in the 1800s. The remains of the battery are still seen today, overlooking the beach. Army soldiers stationed near the battery used the beach for skinny-dipping, and when the beach eventually opened to the public, clothing remained optional.Because Gunnison Beach remains governed by federal law, it is the only legal nude beach in the state, where nudity on state beaches was banned in 1999.As an added bonus, if you need a little liquid courage in order to drop trou in front of thousands of strangers, alcohol is also allowed at Gunnison Beach.Our next destination istheoriginal nude beach ...No email address was supplied by.

Beans, Pure MattersResearch shows a healthy lifestyle can cut your lifetime risk of cancer--and raise your odds of surviving if you get it. Obesity, lack of physical activity, and poor nutrition cause about one in three cancer deaths. Only tobacco causes more.Here are some things you can do to reduce your cancer risk:The relation between the foods you eat and cancer risk is complex. A lot of questions must still be answered. But there is strong evidence that those who eat a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant sources have less chance of contracting some of the most common cancers.The American Cancer Society (ACS) suggests you focus on getting at least five daily servings of a variety of fruit and vegetables and eating whole grains. For protein, choose fish, poultry, or beans rather than red and processed meats. Opt for smaller portions, particularly of meats and other high-calorie foods.Adults should do at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at least five days a week, the ACS says. To reduce colon and breast cancer risk, 45 to 60 minutes is better. Exercise also helps you stay at a healthy weight. That reduces your risk of cancers tied to obesity.Being overweight or obese plays a role in 14 to 20 percent of all cancer-related deaths, the ACS says. That includes cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, and kidney.It may come as no surprise that smoking causes 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths. But smoking ups your risk for at least 14 other types of cancer, too, including throat, stomach, and kidney cancer.When 11 of the 18 major cancers are found early, their five-year survival rates range from 90 to 100 percent. Survival plummets for more advanced cancer.Mammography, for instance, is an important tool for detecting breast cancer early on, when it's easiest to treat. But the benefits and limitations of mammography vary based on factors like age and personal risk. Experts have different recommendations for mammography. Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every two years for women ages 50 to 74. The ACS recommends yearly screening for all women ages 40 and older. Women should talk with their doctors about their personal risk factors before making a decision about when to start getting mammograms or how often they should get them.Cover up, use lots of sunscreen, and make sure your family avoids bad sunburns, especially while young. Too much exposure to ultraviolet rays causes more than a million cases of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year. and doctors expect to find nearly 70,000 cases of more serious melanoma in 2009.The culprits may include cancer-linked chemicals on the job and in the home. A lot of contact with secondhand tobacco smoke, pesticides, and dioxins might raise your risk, for example. Ask your employer about materials you handle. Test your home for radon. Read the labels of household products.On the whole, most authorities suggest a well-rounded diet rather than supplements. In fact, two of three studies of one supplement, the antioxidant beta-carotene, concluded that high doses actually increased smokers' lung cancer risk.You should enjoy:Limit your intake of:No email address was supplied by.

Smith, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky, studied data collected as part of the U.S. Safety Datalink monitoring project. His results -- collected several years after children received their vaccinations -- found little difference on intelligence, speech and behavior tests between children who were vaccinated on schedule and those who waited.Dr. Smith’s analysis found the on-time group -- the group that followed doctor-recommended vaccination schedules -- did slightly better on an intelligence test and answered a little faster on a test asking children to name things. And in no category did the on-time group do worse than the delay group.Why some parents worry about vaccinationsAccording to the CDC, the belief that vaccinations cause autism was perceived because childhood vaccines are administered when symptoms of autism appear. Likewise, they see the link as a false alarm.In its “Infant Immunizations FAQ” the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said “there is no link between them [vaccines] and autism.”Thimerosal, an organic compound, and the MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine have been at the center of this misunderstanding.According to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), since the 1930s, thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, has been added to vaccines to prevent bacteria and fungi contamination. The FDA adds that doing so saved many children’s lives because thimerosal provided uncontaminated vaccines.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said: “It is important to understand that mercury is a natural part of our environment and is found in the fish we eat, the water we drink, and in infant formula and breast milk, among other items. There is no evidence that thimerosal in vaccines is harmful.”Parents have the option to ask their doctors for thimerosal-free vaccines. However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) “does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure.”The MMR vaccine has also been thought to be linked to autism. The AAP disagrees with this assessment.In 1998, a small study was published that linked the MMR vaccine to inflammatory bowel disease and autism. Later these results were rejected because the study was seriously flawed, according to the APP.The APP says: “As a result of the study and its misleading results, many British parents refused to let their children get the vaccine and the number of measles and mumps outbreaks increased in areas where many children are not vaccinated. Subsequent studies and a 2004 Institute of Medicine report have all concluded that there is no association between the MMR vaccine and autism.”Vaccinations are importantBoston Children’s Hospital said “in order to keep these diseases at bay, it’s important your child receives the recommended vaccinations -- for health of your family and the general public.”If you have any concerns about your child’s health or his or her vaccine recommendations, please seek the advice of a medical professional.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Burnt toast and eggs, neckties and shirts, and a day much like every other Father's Day across the decades.So what can you do to ensure your dad's day is one you'll all enjoy and remember for years to come? Make the day easy for him and fill it with shared activities and time together to create a magical day for everyone.Many dads love to fish, but why turn "his" day into more work for him? Instead, hit the Web and run a search for stocked fishing holes where enterprising souls keep the water filled with trout, bass and other fish just waiting to bite. Most stocked fishing ponds rent fishing rods and bait, and many even clean, cook and serve up the caught fish for you. All Dad needs to do is sit back, crack open a soda or beer, and enjoy spending time with his family.Instead of buying him some new aftershave or soap on a rope, how about wrapping up a birdhouse kit?BirdhouseDepot.comoffers kits beginning at just $8.95, which can provide a few hours of fun building together and hours of enjoyment watching the birds come and visit their new home.OrientalTrading.comis another source for inexpensive and fun kits. Other great things to make include model kits or a large Lego set.ModelCars.comandLego.comare sites filled with kits that will provide hours of fun.Find the nearest professional or semi-pro game happening close to home on Father's Day weekend. Get some tickets and plan a full tailgate event to enjoy before the game. Pack up the grill, plenty of picnic and grilling favorites, and a cooler full of Dad's favorite beverage. Pick up a new baseball cap for him and head out to the game to enjoy some sunshine, baseball and your dad.Tailgating.comhas recipes from snacks to chili to meat that you can make to create a memorable day.Pop up plenty of popcorn, set out bowls of candy and nachos and hop over toProjector123.comto rent a movie projector for your backyard. Set up lots of seating and get a few of your dad's favorite films or old home movies and make a special movie night just for him. Combine the evening with a delicious cookout dinner and some sparkling lights strung up to create an atmosphere that could set the tone for a new family Father's Day tradition.Yes, usually when we hear the word "pamper" we think about Mother's Day, not Father's Day. But why not pamper Dad?If you're a good cook, whip up a few of his favorites for a delicious breakfast in bed with a newspaper or his favorite movie. If you're not a whiz in the kitchen, bring him a few of his favorite pastries instead. Then spend the rest of the day with Dad enjoying one of his favorite hobbies.Does he enjoy barbecue? Help him stir up a dry rub and get the ribs or brisket in the smoker. Is the yard his passion? Help him out with mowing, trimming and fertilizing.Is he crazy about jigsaw puzzles? Pick out a big one, set up a table with some drinks and snacks, and start searching for the corner pieces.For dinner, either plan to prepare his favorite, or head to a restaurant where he can be catered to. Make the day about him and see his face light up.Father's Day isn't about what you can buy Dad. At the end of the day, it's about spending time together doing something that makes you both happy. Sharing yourself and your time with the man who helped raise you will strengthen your bond and create memories for years to come.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

However, I haven't joined him in that boat since I was a kid.If your dad is an outdoorsman and you just don't get it, don't worry. You can still find a Father's Day gift he'll love; it will just take a little more work.CampingIf Dad likes to camp, he probably has the basics -- a tent, sleeping bags and pads, rain gear, probably even a cookstove of some variety.So what can you provide?You could opt for an updated sleeping bag; the high-end ones keep you warm in freezing weather and fit like a glove. Or, if camping has become less and less about "roughing it" and more about relaxing, a hammock might be a fun choice. They come in either fold-up or hang-from-trees varieties. Speaking of fold-ups, how are your Dad's lawn chairs? If they're starting to show their age, you could upgrade to some fancier ones -- complete with the cutout hole for his beer.How about a pocket knife? If he doesn't already have one, it would be a good addition to his camping gear; you never know when those things will come in handy.Other camping gift options: updated cookstove, lantern, flashlights, hiking boots, or compass. And for the time Dad spends thinking about camping, some nature-related books might go over well --  find one that details the plants and wildlife around his favorite stomping grounds or one with new campfire recipes.FishingFishing gear has come a long way beyond the simple pole, bobber and tacklebox. Take inventory of what Dad already has (ask Mom for help if you need it), make sure you know what kind of fish he's fishing for, and head to the sporting goods store to find a lure that's sure to help reel them in. If your dad is like mine, he can't have enough lures to try.If he doesn't already have one with which he's in love, a fishing vest would also be a good gift. Get one with all sorts of little pockets in which he can stick his most often-used fishing tools, extra weights, lures, etc. However, I suspect that most dads who already have vests they like won't give them up for something too fancy, so make sure you know going in that it's something your dad will use.If you're looking to spend some money, you could surprise Dad with a new rod and reel. However, there are dozens -- OK, hundreds -- of varieties, so get some help with that. Ideally, get advice from one of his fishing buddies or, at the very least, a sporting-goods store clerk. And if you're still unsure, a gift certificate can be wrapped up, too.HuntingNow, I know very little about hunting, but I do know this: The gear depends entirely on what you're planning to hunt. If your dad is a deer hunter, you might invest in some extra orange gear for him or some of those cool battery-heated socks. It gets chilly in those tree stands! Along the same lines, a thermos or thermal lunchbox might also come in handy.For just about every other kind of hunting: Get out the camo! Can Dad really have enough camouflage gear? I think not. And if he's like most dads, he's not going to update his hunting wardrobe unless prompted. That's where you come in. Find another vest -- same style as the fishing one, but in camo -- as well as water-resistant pants for all the hiking through the wet fields in search of prey. You might also spring for binoculars or new boots.As far as the gun goes, you might want to leave that for Dad. But feel free to find him a new case and extra ammo.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.No email address was supplied by.

No trip to Atlanta would be complete without visiting sites that pay homage to Martin Luther King, the great civil rights leader who was born in Atlanta and preached and died there. King was born in an upstairs bedroom at at home at 501 Auburn Ave., now operated by the National Park Service. Tours with 15 visitors are led by a park ranger only. Visit the Martin Luther King Visitors Center and nearby Ebenezer Baptist Church (if not under renovation), where King delivered sermons.Georgia Aquarium, AtlantaThe Georgia Aquarium is the world's largest with more than 8 million gallons of water, home to 60 exhibits that inspire, entertain, educate and tell the "global water story," aquarium officials say. The zoo is home to 500 species, including six new tiger sharks, beluga whales, sea dragons, giant Pacific octopus and the only manta ray ever housed in a U.S. aquarium. It features a giant transparent tunnel that takes visitors into an underwater world.Zoo AtlantaThe 40-acre, 1,000-animal zoo also has some famous residents, including the two giant pandas Lun Lun and Yang Yang, and their two cubs. The $4.5 million Ford African Rain Forest is home to 24 western lowland gorillas.Blue Ridge FoothillsTourism boosters often recommend a Blue Ridge Mountain and Chattahoochee National Forest trip that includes these cities:Dahlonega,site of the nation's first gold rush in the 1830s, whose draws now include gold mine tours and penny candy at the old-fashioned general store; Cleveland, where Cabbage Patch dolls are made -- and plant tours are available; the Bavarian village ofHelen-- truly a hotspot during Oktoberfest; and Clarkesville, a small town known for antique shops and cafes.SavannahSavannah's old-world, laid-back charm makes it in many ways the opposite of modern, fast-paced Atlanta. The city's visitor's bureau website calls it "hip and historic, robust and refined," and boasts "amazing architecture, spooky cemeteries and rich history -- along with global sophistication, funky nightlife and fabulous food."Okefenokee SwampThe remote Stephen C. Foster State Park is the entrance to legendary Okefenokee Swamp and inside a national wildlife refuge. One of the most mysterious places in Georgia, Okefenokee is home to moss-strewn cypress trees, black swamp waters and swamp life, including black bears, cranes, woodpeckers, and of course, alligators. Take in the sights and sounds of the swamp on an elevated boardwalk trail, take an eco-tour, or rent a boat or canoe. Nine cabins and 66 camping sites are available.Jekyll IslandJekyll Island offers a reasonably affordable beach vacation, with ample swimming, biking, hiking, nature walks, horseback riding, fishing and a quaint historic district. A top attraction is the Georgia Sea Turtle Center, which, during the right season, offers visitors a glimpse of sea turtles. The island's sandy white beaches have become a highly protected sanctuary for the loggerhead sea turtle, monitored by the center. There are a few moderately priced hotels on the island. Camping is available.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.No email address was supplied by.

Oregon adventures span a wide variety of locations, from the mountains to the coast, and from the Columbia River Gorge to the rivers and plains of eastern and central Oregon. Adventurers can enjoy hiking, skiing, kayaking, beachcombing and more. Best of all, many of these outdoor adventures are affordable, even for budget travelers.Mount Hood Meadows Nordic CenterCross-country, or Nordic, skiing is inexpensive and easy, even for inexperienced skiers. The Nordic Center has 15 kilometers of groomed track, and also offers equipment rentals and lessons. Visitors will need to pay a daily track fee, or purchase a season pass. The Nordic Center also offers a "Learn to Cross Country" package, which includes the daylong track fee, equipment rental and a 90-minute lesson. For those feeling more adventurous, cross-country skiing trails are available in more remote locations in the Mount Hood National Forest, too.South Beach State ParkLocated just south of Newport on Oregon's central coast, South Beach State Park offers many outdoor adventure opportunities, including fishing, crabbing, boating, windsurfing and beachcombing. Additionally, in the summer, South Beach State Park offers two-hour kayak tours for ages 6 and up. Kayak tours are $15 per person (subject to change), including equipment and lifejacket rental. Regular state park entrance fees apply, and camping is available. Visitors can also take advantage of nearby attractions such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium and the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse.Columbia River Gorge National Scenic AreaThe beautiful, forested Columbia River Gorge is a can't-miss Oregon attraction, and full of adventure. The gorge includes waterfalls, campgrounds, historical sites, and more than 100 miles of hiking trails, from short and easy day hikes to 30-mile backpacking loops. Hikers can climb to the top of, or behind, several of the waterfalls. Camping is available seasonally at Ainsworth and Viento State Parks, and at U.S. Forest Service campgrounds. Day use fees are not charged at many sites in the gorge, making this a super-affordable adventure destination.Farewell Bend State Recreation AreaVisitors to Farewell Bend, located on the Oregon/Idaho border, can learn about the Oregon Trail through its interpretive displays and see actual Oregon Trail wagon ruts. Visitors can also enjoy fishing, water-skiing and boating on Brownlee Reservoir, and beach volleyball and basketball on land. State park day-use fees apply, and camping is available. In addition, visitors can explore the surrounding area, which includes the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center in Baker City and jet boat tours on the Snake River.Oregon Caves National MonumentThe Oregon Caves are one of southern Oregon's most popular attractions. Visitors can take a 90-minute guided tour of these unique marble caves, plus hike through ancient forests and visit the historic Oregon Caves Chateau. There is no entrance fee for the monument, but there is a fee for guided cave tours. Campgrounds are located within a few miles, but not at the monument itself.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The Coast Guard said a light sheen was reported near the vessel, and its owner was working with responders to minimize the environmental impact.The Coast Guard and state personnel were monitoring the vessel and planned to try to refloat it.

Exxon spent more than $4.4 billion as a result of the spill. That money includes cleanup payments, settlements and fines. Exxon says $2.2 billion was spent on the actual cleanup.Today Eleanor Island, and Prince William Sound appear pristine. On the boat ride out to the island people were snapping pictures of the sea lions, whales and countless fish that could be seen jumping out of the water.Once the crew docked on the beaches they began to dig. About a foot below the surface, they uncovered oil.As water pooled into the hole, a sheen could be seen on the the water and oil dotted the spoons people dipped into the holes.For the newer employees this is a first-hand look at the lasting effects of a spill.“It’s one thing to study in a classroom, and then to come here and see and imagine what the fishermen and the locals had to go through, it’s like looking into a little part of our dark history,” said one of the newest group members, Alicia  Zorzetto.Since the spill there are increased safety precautions in place, in part because of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council. Tugs now accompany oil tankers. The group acts as an industry watch-dog and is funded by the oil industry.“We live with oil, we need oil, and we appreciate our oil industry and all it does for our state,” Swanson said, "but we really have to be mindful that a lot of protection is required to make sure we don’t have another spill because the consequences just don’t go away.”(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Its population inflates to as large as 1,500 in the summer and deflates to less than 200 the rest of the year.Only about 75 miles away from Anchorage, the only access to the town and its gorgeous backdrop is through the Anton Anderson Tunnel that goes right though the Maynard Mountains.The roughly two-and-a-half-mile-long tunnel officially opened to vehicles in June of 2000. It makes for an interesting entrance to what the locals say is an even more interesting town.Majestic views, little urban sprawl, and lack of history -- residents who call Whittier home have their own reasons for moving here."This is kind of like a theme park down in the lower 48, like Disney Land or Sea World," said longtime mayor Lester Lunceford who calls Whittier a utopia because it defines the best of what Alaska has to offer."You come through the tunnel and you have beautiful ocean scenery here with occasionally seeing whales out here in the bay here, lots of sea life and glaciers all around us," Lunceford said.The city boasts a year-round ice-free deep water port and harbor.With 37 percent of the town’s 19.7 square-miles under water, residents say the port is their number-one asset."In theory you can motorize your boat out here in the dead of winter in January and the heat of the summer," Lunceford said.The area was used as a military camp during World War II because of its unique location to the Alaska Railroad and the Prince William Sound. Before that Whittier was a route for the Chugach Alaska Natives, Russians, and Americans who sought out fish and gold. The community wasn't incorporated as a town until 1969. Now, it’s a town of about 180 people who live here year round. Almost all of which live in one building and its one of Alaska's tallest.The 14-story Begich Towers houses 80 percent of the town's population.The mayor was once the police chief."It's not uncommon both as a police chief and mayor for people to come and knock on my door all hours of the day and night," Lunceford said.It's the closeness of residents that attracted Margie Shepard to Whittier. A fixture at the Anchor Inn Restaurant for years, Shepard said it is Whittier’s beauty that stands out most. It's a town that she considers safe because everyone knows who you are and where you will be."Sometimes you take a walk along the beach, you see whales, sea lions," Shepard said. "We don't have shopping malls, theaters and whatnot, but a lot of us don't need that, most of us are home bodies here."Brenda Tolman has lived in Whittier for 31 years. The owner of Log Cabin Gifts, she raised her twin sons in the small town."Both of my kids say that moving them here and raising them here is the best thing I could have possibly done for them," Tolman said.It's a place of familiar surroundings and limited space that visitors have often referred to as strange and residents like Tolman are quick to note it’s not for everyone."I usually say nobody invited you here," Tolman said. "If you have a family, you’re doing family things, and whatever type of work you do, your time is pretty much taken up."Whittier, with its sole entrance through a long tunnel, shares many qualities with its residents: unique and interesting, with a focus on letting its history unfold organically. Whittier is a town that is trying to grow not only in population but through land. Lunceford says 25 years ago they were deeded 640 acres in an area known as Shotgun Cove by the State of Alaska to develop. So far through grants they have built 2 miles out of the 11 miles needed to expand the road."Sometimes you fight with your brothers and sisters,” Lunceford said. “That is not uncommon out here either, but whenever trouble happens, everyone pulls together."ContactCorey Allen-YoungFriend Corey on FacebookFollow Corey on Twitter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

They dream that one day they will become self-made millionaires with the help of a special idea developed in their basements or garages.Many of the big million-dollar (or billion-dollar) ideas of this generation are related to technology, from Apple and Microsoft to Google, from MySpace and YouTube to Facebook.Still, this doesn't rule out simple hands-on ingenuity for becoming a self-made millionaire. Here's a small sampling of million-dollar ideas, past and present.Great Depression Basic: Spic and SpanThe problem with economic hard times is that even if an inventor comes up with a million-dollar idea, who's going to buy it? A foursome in Saginaw, Mich., addressed this dilemma during the beginning of the Great Depression in 1930. They realized that no matter how dire poverty may become, families still needed to clean their houses.Harold and Naomi Stenglein, together with Glenn and Elizabeth McDonald, wondered how they possibly could make ends meet. One day the women were talking about the drudgery of washing walls. The first pass with soapy water imparted scum. The second pass of clear hot water produced streaks, so yet a third dry wipe was required.Elizabeth McDonald noticed that a relative had melted some paste glue into the wash water. This produced clean results, except the whole house stank. The two couples started experimenting with various combinations until they came up with a no-rinse, no-wipe mix of three elements: sodium phosphate for deep cleaning; powdered glue to absorb the scum; and sodium carbonate to prevent the glue from hardening, and to remove the odor.Door-to-door peddling in Saginaw evolved into local, regional and eventually nationwide sales. According to Public Libraries of Saginaw archives, the Stengleins and the McDonalds in 1945 sold Spic and Span to Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati for $1.9 million.Baby Boomer Toy: SlinkyRichard James of Philadelphia was doing his World War II duty on the home front in 1943 as a Navy tool worker in Philadelphia. He observed a torsion spring coil fall from a workshop table and take several "steps" before coming to a stop.Normally, this would have been simply another moment in time, but James apparently was a child at heart, because he immediately saw the idea for a toy. He spent two years testing various gauges of steel, according to the Lemelson-MIT Program Web site, striving to find the ideal material and length that would cause his coil to march down one stairway step to the next.His wife, Betty, came up with the term "Slinky," Swedish for sleek and sinuous. The couple produced 400 units and took them to a Gimbel's department store to sell for $1 each during the postwar Christmas season of 1945. The stock was gone within 90 minutes. More than 250 million units later, everyone still knows the Slinky.Infomercial Innovator: Ron PopielScores of inventors have capitalized their million-dollar ideas via the TV infomercial, and the pioneer is Ron Popeil of the ubiquitous Ronco Inc.Ron Popiel's father, Samuel Popiel, was marketing the Chop-O-Matic (forerunner of the Veg-O-Matic) door-to-door in New York City during the 1950s. However, salesmen had trouble carrying enough veggies for demonstrations, so charismatic young Ron Popeil hosted a videotape demonstration. Through telemarketing, Chop/Veg-O-Matic went on to sell millions at an original price of $3.98.Ron Popeil wasn't a man with just one million-dollar idea. Through the years came products such as the Pocket Fisherman ("biggest fishing invention since the hook"), Mr. Microphone, the Smokeless Ash Tray, and finally, the Showtime Rotisserie ("set it and forget it").Not all of his ideas were hits. GLH-9 Hair in a Can Spray didn't get far; neither did the container-opening Cap Snaffler. Nonetheless, Ron Popeil was already a multimillionaire four years ago when he sold Ronco for another cool $55 million.Green Invention: Java LogRod Sprules of Ottawa, Ontario, was a thirty-something mechanical engineer during the mid-1990s when he spotted a short magazine article about coffee, according to NationalGeographic.com. The article explained how ground coffee beans burn with surprisingly intense heat. The topic was preparation of great-tasting coffee, not home heating, but Sprules jotted a note in his "idea book."Months later, Sprules felt inspired to mix dried, recycled coffee grounds with some wax, and he lit the mixture. Viola! This sparked his idea for what eventually became the Java Log, a one-of-a-kind artificial fireplace log. Sprules' Java Log not only produces a larger flame than comparable products, but it emits 85 percent less harmful carbon dioxide than firewood, according to reports from sources ranging from The New York Times to Entrepreneur Magazine.Sprules started by selling his product to family and friends, and never looked back. Profits first exceeded $1 million in 2003, and sales of Java Logs still are catching fire.Copyright Internet Broadcasting.

Entire books have been devoted to the complex topic and theories about barbecue techniques and recipes in the state are as varied as its enthusiasts. It is an understatement to say people take it seriously.But most barbecue fans can at least agree that the state?s barbecued meat of choice is pork, and the state is roughly divided into two distinct barbecue cultures. In western North Carolina, you'll find mostly pork shoulder, or Boston butts, whereas in the east it is all about the whole-hog cookery.Further, Eastern Carolina barbecue tends to feature vinegar-based sauce, whereas in the west it is tomato-based.But it would be ridiculous here to argue sauces. Let?s just list a few of the good places to go to sample this North Carolina delicacy: Herb?s Pit BBQ in Murphy; Little Pig?s and Barbecue Inn in Ashville; Lexington Barbecue in Lexington, a city so bold it boasts being the state?s ?Barbecue Capital? and is host to the Barbecue Festival in October; Stamey?s in Greensboro; Allen & Son in Chapel Hill; Wilber?s Barbecue in Goldsboro; Parker?s, Bill Ellis Barbecue and Mitchell?s Barbecue, all three in Wilson; and Hill?s Lexington Bar-B-Q in Winston-Salem.If all that is a bit dizzying, consider consulting the North Carolina Barbecue Society HistoricTrail-- and then eat your way across the state.There's one more signature dish in North Carolina: Calabash, which takes its name from a little fishing town on the Atlantic near the South Carolina border. Typically that style involves corn-meal batter-fried seafood -- scallops, crabs, clams, oysters and shrimp -- although you?ll find fresh or raw foods labeled "Calabash," too.Here a few festivals where you can sample the state?s staples: North Carolina Seafood Festival, held in October on the Moorehead City waterfront; the Blue Crab Festival in May in Little River; the North Carolina Turkey Festival in September in Raeford (the state is a major turkey producer); the North Carolina Pickle Festival in April in Mt. Olive; the North Carolina Strawberry Festival in April in Chadbourn (one of several strawberry fests); and the North Carolina Yam Festival in October in Tabor City.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But why not pamper Dad?If you're a good cook, whip up a few of his favorites for a delicious breakfast in bed with a newspaper or his favorite movie. If you're not a whiz in the kitchen, bring him a few of his favorite pastries instead. Then spend the rest of the day with Dad enjoying one of his favorite hobbies.Does he enjoy barbecue? Help him stir up a dry rub and get the ribs or brisket in the smoker. Is the yard his passion? Help him out with mowing, trimming and fertilizing.Is he crazy about jigsaw puzzles? Pick out a big one, set up a table with some drinks and snacks, and start searching for the corner pieces.For dinner, either plan to prepare his favorite, or head to a restaurant where he can be catered to. Make the day about him and see his face light up.Father's Day isn't about what you can buy Dad. At the end of the day, it's about spending time together doing something that makes you both happy. Sharing yourself and your time with the man who helped raise you will strengthen your bond and create memories for years to come.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

State Natural Resources Commissioner Dan Sullivan has said that under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the Interior Secretary must approve an exploration plan if it meets the necessary requirements. He has said he believes the plan does.Gov. Sean Parnell said the feds, in their rejection, relied on an inaccurate interpretation of the law.No email address was supplied by.

Its population inflates to as large as 1,500 in the summer and deflates to less than 200 the rest of the year.Only about 75 miles away from Anchorage, the only access to the town and its gorgeous backdrop is through the Anton Anderson Tunnel that goes right though the Maynard Mountains.The roughly two-and-a-half-mile-long tunnel officially opened to vehicles in June of 2000. It makes for an interesting entrance to what the locals say is an even more interesting town.Majestic views, little urban sprawl, and lack of history -- residents who call Whittier home have their own reasons for moving here."This is kind of like a theme park down in the lower 48, like Disney Land or Sea World," said longtime mayor Lester Lunceford who calls Whittier a utopia because it defines the best of what Alaska has to offer."You come through the tunnel and you have beautiful ocean scenery here with occasionally seeing whales out here in the bay here, lots of sea life and glaciers all around us," Lunceford said.The city boasts a year-round ice-free deep water port and harbor.With 37 percent of the town’s 19.7 square-miles under water, residents say the port is their number-one asset."In theory you can motorize your boat out here in the dead of winter in January and the heat of the summer," Lunceford said.The area was used as a military camp during World War II because of its unique location to the Alaska Railroad and the Prince William Sound. Before that Whittier was a route for the Chugach Alaska Natives, Russians, and Americans who sought out fish and gold. The community wasn't incorporated as a town until 1969. Now, it’s a town of about 180 people who live here year round. Almost all of which live in one building and its one of Alaska's tallest.The 14-story Begich Towers houses 80 percent of the town's population.The mayor was once the police chief."It's not uncommon both as a police chief and mayor for people to come and knock on my door all hours of the day and night," Lunceford said.It's the closeness of residents that attracted Margie Shepard to Whittier. A fixture at the Anchor Inn Restaurant for years, Shepard said it is Whittier’s beauty that stands out most. It's a town that she considers safe because everyone knows who you are and where you will be."Sometimes you take a walk along the beach, you see whales, sea lions," Shepard said. "We don't have shopping malls, theaters and whatnot, but a lot of us don't need that, most of us are home bodies here."Brenda Tolman has lived in Whittier for 31 years. The owner of Log Cabin Gifts, she raised her twin sons in the small town."Both of my kids say that moving them here and raising them here is the best thing I could have possibly done for them," Tolman said.It's a place of familiar surroundings and limited space that visitors have often referred to as strange and residents like Tolman are quick to note it’s not for everyone."I usually say nobody invited you here," Tolman said.

But you might be surprised to learn that many of the "facts" you know about cats are actually untrue. For example, while cats often purr when they're happy, they may also purr when they're anxious or uncomfortable.Do you know fact from fiction about your cat? Here are a few common cat myths debunked:Myth #1. Cats should drink cow's milk. Cats do not need to drink milk. In fact, cats typically lose the ability to drink milk after they're weaned, so feeding them milk can give them diarrhea.Myth #2. Cats should eat fish. It's perfectly fine to give Fluffy fish every once in awhile, but it's far from kitty's ideal food. Cats need an amino acid called taurine in their diet, and fish do not provide it. Fish, as a regular part of the diet, could make your cat sick.Myth #3. It is natural for cats to have bad breath. If kitty's "morning breath" makes you want to heave, it's a sign that your cat has an oral health problem and should see a veterinarian. You can prevent dental problems by brushing your cat's teeth. If your cat is uncooperative, try adding oral care probiotics to its food.Myth #4. Cats always land on their feet. Cats are agile creatures with the ability to twist in mid-air, but if they're falling from a short height, they won't have time to put themselves feet-first. A fall from a great height could kill or seriously injure a cat, whether it lands on its feet or not.Myth #5. Cats gain weight if they are spayed or neutered. Cats' metabolisms do change after they are fixed, but weight gain can be easily avoided by simply decreasing the amount of food that you feed them. Spaying or neutering is one of the the best things you can do for your cat, as it reduces the risk of some types of cancer and helps your cat avoid contributing to the pet overpopulation problem.No email address was supplied by.

She describes Community Health Aides as the eyes and ears for doctors in rural Alaska and without their help, Dr. Riley says her job as a physician in Dillingham would be extremely difficult.Community Health Aides work at village clinics that are extensions of Kanakanak Hospital. They are vital to the health of Bristol Bay area communities.“There was a time when many of our villages did not have community health aides and it was difficult to get into the hospital, so many people would just die,” Dr. Riley said.Life in rural Alaska can be challenging, especially with harsh weather that can make communities inaccessible in case of an emergency. That’s when health aides around the state step in to bridge the gap between sick or injured patients in remote places and doctors in larger communities.In the Bristol Bay region, health clinics are in 27 villages. Dr. Riley describes these aides as the backbone to basic health care for the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation (BBAHC).“They can do intravenous lines, they can give IVN antibiotic or intramuscular antibiotic. They can administer oxygen and sometimes they even deliver babies out in the villages,” Dr. Riley said.With the advancements of technology and the constant communication between the community health aide and the physicians, both parties determine if the patient’s condition is extensive enough to be transported to the Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham.“We see patients daily, anywhere from common colds, to cuts, to fish hooks, to ATV accidents,” said Maria Paul, Field Coordinator for the Community Health Aide Program with BBAHC.Paul has been a community health aide for seven years. In addition to weather concerns when transporting patients to Dillingham, she admits there are a number of other challenges.“Togiak’s light are out, so flights have to leave between sun rise and sun set and if anything happens during the night time, we can’t medevac them without airplane lights,” Paul said.That’s why Paul and many like her serve as vital members of their community. Health aides perform numerous health care services, from providing immunizations to managing chronic diseases, treating emergencies and saving lives.“It’s both challenging and rewarding. I love the people of Bristol Bay and I enjoy my job so far,” Paul said.According to Dr. Riley, this method of is sometimes hard for other doctors in the lower-48 to understand.“For us out here in rural Alaska, that’s just part of life,” Dr. Riley said. “The community health aides, man they make life good for us.”It’s these challenges that both Dr. Riley and Paul face that makes living in rural Alaska truly unique.Contact Caslon HatchCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

As we age, our bodies and metabolism change. Although older adults still need plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fiber, they need to add or subtract a few things from the diet they followed earlier in life.Many older adults have a decreased sense of taste and decreased absorption. They need to make sure they get enough water and nutrients, even if they must take supplements to get them.Although we all should drink eight glasses of water a day, it's critical for older adults to factor in water because they have decreased kidney function and may not feel thirsty.Adequate water intake helps avoid constipation. Older adults' digestive tracts don't work as effectively as they once did, making constipation more likely, and many older adults have dental problems that keep them from eating as much fiber as they need. Fiber also helps prevent constipation.Another possible addition to an older adult's diet is a vitamin and mineral supplement. Older adults often don't get enough calcium or vitamin D in their diet, and a lack of either of those can lead to bone loss and osteoporosis. Vitamin B12is another nutrient that's often found lacking in older adults. As the body ages, it becomes less able to absorb B12from foods. B12is critical for healthy nerve and red blood cells. Vitamin B12supplements may be taken as a pill, an injection, or a gel applied to the inside of the nose.You should discuss the issue of supplements with your health care provider. Older adults already purchase more supplements than other age groups. Unfortunately, false advertising leads them to believe that supplements will stop or curb the aging process.Recent research indicates that many problems associated with the aging process can be slowed with a good diet. So the benefits associated with consuming a balanced, nutrient-rich diet are endless.One good way to find out what you need in daily nutrition is to visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website My Pyramid. The site asks for your age, gender, and level of physical activity to determine your daily caloric needs.My Pyramid, based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the USDA, encourages people to eat a suggested amount from five major food groups each day. If you can't do that, at least try to eat something from each group each day. Choose lower-fat foods and include vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.These are suggested amounts from the Dietary Guidelines:Other tips for good nutrition:Fruits and vegetables are a real plus for seniors, because they are lower in calories than other foods, yet high in nutrients, Fruit is much healthier for dessert than cookies or cake--yet many older adults indulge their sweet tooth with sugary treats rather than fresh fruit.Some older adults have trouble getting adequate nutrition because of health problems or financial difficulties. If these are problems that affect you, there are steps you can take to ease them.If you have trouble chewing, you might not be able to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, or meat. Instead, you might try the following ideas, from the FDA:If certain foods give you gas, try these alternatives:If you can't shop or cook for yourself, you can make other arrangements. Some groceries will deliver food at no charge; others charge a fee. A family member, friend, or church or synagogue group may be able to help with shopping. A senior citizen program in your area may deliver meals. You can use the microwave to cook already-prepared meals. You might consider moving to a place where meals are prepared for you--either with a family member or a senior citizens' center. Eating with other people also is a good way to encourage your appetite; eating alone can be lonely.If money is a problem, here are some suggestions from the FDA:No email address was supplied by.

"The good news being there's a lot of small fish so based on what we can see now and current harvest levels, we don't expect to go to a one fish bag limit in south central Alaska."Tom Gemmell, the Executive Director of the Halibut Coalition, says the current rules needed changing."The model doesn't work very well in terms of sharing the conservation responsibility for the halibut," Gemmell said.Jim Martin, a spokesman for The Alaska Charter Association says the proposed plan is confusing about its expectations for bag limits."We see about a 30 percent drop in allocation that would be enough in a lot of situations to reduce the bag limit of charter anglers from two fish to one fish in south central Alaska, so that's a big concern," Martin said.The North Pacific Fishery Management Council says despite the confusion, it's unlikely the plan would call for a reduction in bag limits for charter operators."Based on what we see now and the current harvest levels and what we see in terms of the halibut biomass projections, we don't think we're going to need to go to a one fish bag limit," Oliver said.NPFMC said even if the bag limit was reduced, there are safeguards in the plan."There is a provision that will allow charter operators to lease up fish from the commercial sector and offer their client an additional fish," Oliver said.The Alaska Charter Association says the provision in the plan wouldn't be a fair compromise for allocation."We're willing to live within those limits, but not willing to give up allocation and then rent it back," Martin said.NOAA made an announcement that it would continue public comment until August 26th on Wednesday, adding an additional 14 days for people to weigh in, but there are concerns about whether charter crews would have enough time to review the plan before weighing in."The guys work twelve to fourteen hours a day and they're not taking days off," Martin said. "It takes about 8 hours to plow through it, when do people have time to do that."Others say the plan has been around long enough and there have been plenty of opportunities for people to voice their opinions."This catch sharing plan was first adopted by the council in October 2008 and there were many many meetings on that and lots of opportunities for public comment during the rule making stage in 2011," Gemmell said. "There was about 4,000 comments submitted then."Despite clarification questions, both commercial fishermen and charter operators say they are willing to compromise for the future of the halibut."I think it is a fair plan and this latest go around of commercial sector and central gulf lost more fish to the charter side -- quite a big bump of allocation for them, but that's just the way it goes in the council process," Gemmell said."I don't think the charter fishermen are opposed to having a limit, certainly not and are opposed to conservation, but we just want a fair allocation," Martin said.Editor's Note: Clarifies National Marine Fisheries Service to North Pacific Fishery Management CouncilContact: Samantha AngaiakCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Thanks to that magical gateway, those of us with a taste for rare and exotic foodstuffs no longer have to wait for our local grocer to carry them or try to get a friend to buy them and send them to us.  With a few keystrokes, the world is brought to our doorsteps.Of course, not everything out there is worth buying.  A pretty website and an efficiently designed ordering system is not always indicative of food you have any business actually trying to eat.  This is especially true, in my experience, of mixtures like salsa, piccalilli, chow chow, chutney and the like.  The fact that you love the mango chutney from one site does not in any way mean you'll like a similar product from another site.That's where I come in.  I fearlessly throw myself on potential culinary grenades every week and let you know which ones belong in your arsenal and which ones should be left for the bomb disposal unit.This week, I've got two very different but completely fantastic finds to tell you about.  One will make your Labor Day cookout a real standout, and the other will keep you covered for everything from movie-watching time to after-school snacks.First on the list isSlawsa, a condiment that's good on everything from brats, dogs and burgers to grilled cheese sandwiches and tortilla chips.Slawsa, brainchild of Justin Odom, of Chattanooga, Tenn., is a hybrid of slaw and salsa (as the name implies).  It’s crisp and light, but it’s got a flavor punch that overshadows ordinary relish or other dog toppings.  I’ve yet to find a single grilled meat, from dogs and burgers to fish and chops, that doesn’t play nicely with it.  It’s got less salt than most other similar products, and it’s fat- and cholesterol-free.It goes fantastically well with mild cheeses, as well.  I was making grilled cheese sandwiches with  brioche bread and American cheese, and added a spoonful of Slawsa to mine.  The heat of toasting brought out more flavors in the mix and really made the sandwich sing.Like salsa, Slawsa can be eaten straight from a bowl.  At my Fourth of July shindig, I put two bowls of Slawsa on the table intending them to be part of the hot dog and bratwurst fixings.  By the time the sausages hit the table, only one bowl was left.  Someone had found a bag of tortilla chips in my pantry and put paid to the other bowl.Slawsa is the spiritual kin to the chow chows, relishes and salsas you’ll find at town markets all over the country, family recipes that someone decided to try selling on a small scale. Thanks to the Internet, these sorts of things are now available to the general public.  If you live in the Southeast, you may be lucky enough to have a grocery store in your town carrying Slawsa.  If not, you can order it online.<h3>Earth-Friendly Popcorn</h3>It's less than a month until the kids go back to school in a lot of places, and some of my friends with year-round programs have already sent their offspring back to class.  As ever, it's not long before the demand for after-school snacks begins, especially for parents of those robotic eating machines known as "teenagers."Microwave popcorn has long been a favorite, since it's easy to prepare, fairly filling and tasty.  And now, it's earth-friendly and a lot better for you thanks toQuinn Popcorn.Quite simply, Quinn Popcorn is microwave popcorn reinvented.  Kristy, who worked for the company behind the Rock Band and Dance Central video games, and her better half, Coulter, an engineer, named the company after their son and were determined to design a product that would taste great and break the processed-food mold.Kristy is a hard-core foodie.  As Coulter says, "With Kristy at the helm even a sim­ple meal results in every mea­sur­ing cup, mix­ing bowl, uten­sil, etc. spread across our tiny counter."  The results, of course, are worth the effort.Coulter brings an engineer's analytical skills to the equation, and with the two of them working together the end product is a concoction of simple flavors and ingredients combined in a way that will have you tossing out all other, lesser, microwave popcorn.Quinn Popcorn is totally free of the synthetic chemicals and subpar ingredients that have plagued microwave popcorn since its inception, and is the first microwave popcorn to use a chemical-free compostable bag.  Every ingredient Quinn Popcorn uses is non-GMO. The popcorn is organic. The cheese is rBGH-free. The maple sugar is harvested in Vermont. Their oils are expeller-pressed and low in saturated fats. They never use preservatives or any other additives.  The flavors (Parmesan & Rosemary,  Vermont Maple & Sea Salt, and Lemon & Sea Salt) are like nothing else available, and will delight even the most jaded snacker.The popcorn pops in the bag without any oils or flavors. Those are added after it's finished, by a process my own sons have come to call the "double-shake," the first one for the oil and the second for the seasoning.  By the time the second shake is done, the aroma coming from the bag (or bowl, if you like to get adventurous and toss it) will have everyone in range reaching for a handful.You need this in your snacking arsenal.  Just imagine kids' movie night with bowls full of the maple popcorn, or a football-watching party with bowls of each!  Go to thestore locatorto find a vendor near you, or order it online.And keep an eye on Kristy and Coulter.  Something tells me they're not done inventing just yet.Got a question?  Comment?

It involves a single vessel towing a magnetometer and a sonar array, which measures sound returns from an airgun to map the seabed. About 620 miles of ice gouge surveys will be conducted, along with nearly 2,000 miles of shallow hazards surveys.The survey indicates Shell’s continued interest in Arctic drilling, despite its decision in February to shelve its 2013 plans for exploratory drilling in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. That move followed difficulties such as the New Year’s Eve grounding of the conical drilling unit Kulluk, as well as safety and pollution violations aboard the drillship Noble Discoverer -- issues which caused both ships to be taken to Asia for repairs.In a July 17 letter to Shell (PDF), the Alaska region office of the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management says it has no objection to Shell’s plans, provided that they comply with federal law.“Our review indicates that the ancillary activities described in the notice comply with the performance standards,” David Johnston, the regional supervisor for the Alaska region’s Office of Leasing and Plans, wrote. “Accordingly, BOEM has no objection to Shell proceeding with the ancillary activities.”In an April 19 environmental impact statement sent to BOEM (PDF), Shell says the sonar surveys, which have been taking place since 2008, will “generate data necessary to evaluate the physical environment in the vicinity of Shell’s on-going Chukchi Sea exploration program for the possible future location of facilities to support continued exploration activities.”BOEM spokesperson John Callahan says that while the bureau reviewed Shell’s plan to determine whether it complies with federal law, the company isn’t legally bound to seek federal approval before conducting its survey work -- as it was in August 2012, when Interior Secretary Ken Salazar granted Shell a permit for its drilling work.“There was not that issue of giving Shell a permit to drill,” Callahan said.While BOEM’s opinions weren’t binding on Shell, the company also submitted its plans to other federal groups, such as the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.“It’s a very collaborative process involving scientists from a bunch of different agencies,” Callahan said.Shell Alaska spokesperson Megan Baldino didn’t have formal comment on BOEM’s memo, noting that the sonar work in both the Chukchi and Beaufort seas is an ongoing project that has been approved and conducted in previous years.BOEM’s letter to Shell includes a list of precautions to minimize biological impacts on marine mammals and birds, including fresh tests of its airgun when it moves into new areas to determine the underwater radius of its noise. In addition, Shell vessels are asked to minimize the use of work lights on deck to avoid unnecessarily attracting birds.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Beans, Pure MattersResearch shows a healthy lifestyle can cut your lifetime risk of cancer--and raise your odds of surviving if you get it. Obesity, lack of physical activity, and poor nutrition cause about one in three cancer deaths. Only tobacco causes more.Here are some things you can do to reduce your cancer risk:The relation between the foods you eat and cancer risk is complex. A lot of questions must still be answered. But there is strong evidence that those who eat a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant sources have less chance of contracting some of the most common cancers.The American Cancer Society (ACS) suggests you focus on getting at least five daily servings of a variety of fruit and vegetables and eating whole grains. For protein, choose fish, poultry, or beans rather than red and processed meats. Opt for smaller portions, particularly of meats and other high-calorie foods.Adults should do at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at least five days a week, the ACS says. To reduce colon and breast cancer risk, 45 to 60 minutes is better. Exercise also helps you stay at a healthy weight. That reduces your risk of cancers tied to obesity.Being overweight or obese plays a role in 14 to 20 percent of all cancer-related deaths, the ACS says. That includes cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, and kidney.It may come as no surprise that smoking causes 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths. But smoking ups your risk for at least 14 other types of cancer, too, including throat, stomach, and kidney cancer.When 11 of the 18 major cancers are found early, their five-year survival rates range from 90 to 100 percent. Survival plummets for more advanced cancer.Mammography, for instance, is an important tool for detecting breast cancer early on, when it's easiest to treat. But the benefits and limitations of mammography vary based on factors like age and personal risk. Experts have different recommendations for mammography. Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every two years for women ages 50 to 74. The ACS recommends yearly screening for all women ages 40 and older. Women should talk with their doctors about their personal risk factors before making a decision about when to start getting mammograms or how often they should get them.Cover up, use lots of sunscreen, and make sure your family avoids bad sunburns, especially while young. Too much exposure to ultraviolet rays causes more than a million cases of basal and squamous cell  skin cancers each year. and doctors expect to find nearly 70,000 cases of more serious melanoma in 2009.The culprits may include cancer-linked chemicals on the job and in the home. A lot of contact with secondhand tobacco smoke, pesticides, and dioxins might raise your risk, for example. Ask your employer about materials you handle. Test your home for radon. Read the labels of household products.On the whole, most authorities suggest a well-rounded diet rather than supplements.You should enjoy:Limit your intake of:No email address was supplied by.

The screen guard proved no match for the bear when it came to protecting the house.Tuesday, after the bears took off, the Joneses discovered their kitchen had been ransacked by the mother bear.Jones said all of the cupboards were opened and emptied out. Food scattered the floor.But that was not the last the Joneses saw the bears.They stopped by several more times throughout the night, at least once peering through the same window through which the mom bear entered and exited.The family thought the bears had left for good when they were last sighted around 11 a.m. Tuesday.But this evening, Jones emailed to say the bears had come back and got into a scuffle with the family dog. She said the bear cut up the dog’s paw.The Joneses have notified the Alaska Department of Fish and Game of the run-ins.Wildlife officials told Jones she may have to start carrying bear spray and be prepared to use it. They also told her to make sure to close her windows when she leaves the house.Jones tried to take the whole ordeal in stride.“It was quite a (sight) to see for our children and family visiting from Ireland,” Jones wrote in an email. “We made a promise of a true Alaska experience and I believe we followed through.”Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Here in Alaska, on its northern coast, the business is beginning to boom in the village of Kaktovik.<COL>Polar Bear Viewing Tours Take off in Kaktovik (VIDEO)Wild polar bear viewing is a unique industry, limited to very few places on the earth. Here in Alaska, on its northern coast, the business is beginning to boom in the village of Kaktovik.“Very few [tourists] ask about other animals, they're all here to see the polar bears,” said polar bear viewing guide Bruce Inglangasak.Originally from Canda, Inglangasak said he has been offering polar bear viewing tours by boat since about 2002. He said he has brought tourists from all around the world within just feet of the massive polar bears.“First [the tourists] were all scared and then I tell them this is how close we get to [the bears],” Inglangasak said. “They don't bother us, and these are really mellow animals when they're here because they're here for one reason and that's to feed at the bone pile.”Polar Bear Wildlife Biolgist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Susi Miller, said there is no established distance that people must stay away from bears when viewing.“It's based more on the bear’s behavior,” Miller said. “These trained guides -- they know that they can approach in a manner; as long as it’s not changing the behavior of the bear they're fine.”Miller explained currently four people in Kaktovik are licensed and trained to guide polar bear tours. Inglangasak said he knows of about 11 boats that are operating tours.“It does take experience with bears to know how they behave, how they're going to respond to you and every bear it's different,” Miller said. “So we really rely on those guides to get that right.”During fall whaling season in the village the number of bears on shore rises, Inglangasak said. Each year Miller said the number of bears staying on the shores of Kaktovik is rising.“We believe that’s related to ice and their availability to hunt successfully,” Miller said. “When the ice recedes in the summertime most of the bears go with the ice, but if they do remain with the ice, they have less opportunity to hunt seals.”Miller said the polar bears that do come to shore, in places like Kaktovik, are making use of an alternative food source.Inglangasak said during whaling season unused portions of the whale are discarded at the village bone pile for the bears to eat. On a good day during whaling season tourists can see up to two dozen wild polar bears. During September he is completely booked with tours that range from nearly $400 to $550 for a few hours, Inglangasak said.The polar bear viewing business has attracted many tourists to the area and Inglangasak said at first not all of the locals were in favor of the outsiders coming to their village."It was kind of a mixed group but now they're starting to see it's good for our community,” said Inglangasak.Inglangasak said in a few weeks he makes enough money to support his family through the year.Miller said there are about 1,500 polar bears living in the southern Beaufort Sea population. Last year U.S. Fish and Wildelife Service counted more than 80 polar bears. Miller said it is possible that people visiting Kaktovik can see about 8 percent of the that region's polar bear population.ContactMallory Peebles(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

The agony is even worse when you don't just pay for it: you're also the one who takes your trash to the dump. Even if you don't pay for garbage service, reducing the amount of waste you generate ought to perk up your ears, because it makes a big difference to the environment.Fortunately, those of us with years of rural living experience have some skills we can bequeath to you when it comes to the garbage reduction department, because there are few things we enjoy less than taking a load of trash to the dump. Not only is it majorly gross, it's a sober reminder of exactly how much waste we generate on an annual basis (4.4 pounds per person per day in 2011!).So, how can you get your trash habit under control?1. Bring home less stuffThis might seem obvious, but it bears repeating. Everything you bring into your home needs to be processed in one way or another; if it can't be used up, recycled, or repurposed, where does it end up? The garbage.Thus, buying jam in jars can be a good decision, because the jars can be sterilized and used for home canning, used as storage containers, or turned to all kinds of creative crafting uses. Buying meat packed on a styrofoam tray? Not such a good call, because all that shrink wrap and styrofoam is ending up in one place: the trash.Think about what you need and how you plan to use it before you buy, and try to avoid unneccesary products and packaging. You may also want to consider the waste stream of the products you're buying. Some industries are notorious for generating high amounts of waste (for example, bleached virgin paper involves substantial resources to fell trees, process timber, pulp it, and bleach it to give your paper that gorgeous white color) and you might want to consider turning to alternate sources, like post-consumer products that use recycled components.2. CompostThere's no reason food scraps should be going in the trash (although composting fish, meat, and dairy can get complex and isn't recommended unless you're an advanced composter). And yard trimmings should be getting composted too. But did you know there area ton of other things that can totally get composted? Paper, cardboard, and fiberboard scraps, dust bunnies, hair, pet food, cupcake cups, and more can all be appropriately disposed of in the compost.Scared of compost, or don't have the room? Lots of cities,like Portland, offer curbside compost pickup and take greenwaste to a central processing facility. Others provide compost containers free or at low cost, along with a quick orientation, to residents who want to take up composting. Ask about composting programs in your area.3. RecycleAnother one that might seem obvious in a recycling-heavy world, but hang on a minute. First of all, the number of recyclable things is a lot larger than you might think, and you might actually be able toget money for your recycling. In addition to curbside pickup, most cities have a transfer station that provides buyback and redemption credit for residents who bring recycling with the right markings, including glass bottles and some types of cans.Not only that, butmandatory buyback and takeback programsfor lots of products are also in place in a number of states. That means that instead of throwing something away, you can not only return it for recycling and processing, but get some cash for it. Pretty cool, eh? If a required takeback program doesn't apply, a product might still have one through a manufacturer, dealer, or support organization; for example, old cell phones can often be given to domestic violence organizations, who use them to provide survivors with phones they can use to place emergency calls (you can dial 911 from a cellphone even if it's not connected with an active network).4. ReuseObviously, the most fun of all. It's easy to turntrash to treasureif you're motivated, and a lot of products can find new life as something else, or as a component of another thing you're using around the house. Before throwing something out, assess why you're tossing it, and think about potential alternative uses.For example, holey old socks are terrible for wearing, but they actually make great dust mitts. Slip one over your hand and run it along hard-to-dust surfaces, and watch the grime lift away! Likewise, ragged tees and other clothes can be cut up into household rags for cleaning, used in rag-rags, and added to the stuffing of pet toys, allowing them to bypass the dreaded trashcan.5. Compression centralInevitably, you're going to generate some garbage. Give yourself some motivation by downscaling your trash service to the smallest possible container, so you'll be limited each week. If you end up with extra because of a special situation (like when you're moving), take the extra trash to the dump or consider asking for an extra can for just that week.At the same time, compress your trash. Tightly-compacted trash fills a can more slowly, obviously, and allows you to waste less space. Turn dump trips to an every six months endeavor instead of every month, and prevent constant overflows from your trash bin every week.6. Say no to rats (and other pests)If there's one thing we all know about garbage, it's that it tends to attract unsavory elements. By keeping a lot of waste out of your can, you'll make your garbage much less interesting to visitors likeNorway rats. It's especially important to make sure food waste and trash contaminated with food never ends up in the can, because if it does, it will appeal to raccoons, skunks, rats, cockroaches, and other creatures you definitely do not want stopping by. Remember that insects can show up anywhere, but they especially love old, established cities with a rich history; if you're enjoying a handsome pre-war home in Hyde Park, for example, you might need aChicago exterminatorto help you eliminate cockroaches and start with a clean slate.Askilled handymancan help you build a trash enclosure that also doubles as a sorting facility, giving you a chance to engage in last-minute interventions to keep things that don't belong in the trash out of it. Your enclosure should have high fences and locking doors to ensure animals can't get in and knock your cans over to get at the trash. If repeat pests are a problem, tie or lock the lids down to keep animals out.7. Think outside the boxMany of us use specialty products in our lives that tend to generate a lot of waste in the form of packaging and other components, even though we don't really need to. For example, it's not uncommon for people to maintain a huge array of cleaning products with separate types for windows, counters, tubs and tile, and so forth. Did you know that you can use an all-purpose cleaner, including one you make yourself, instead? A jug of vinegar will meet a lot of cleaning needs, with a lot less waste.No email address was supplied by.

Those days are long gone.<COL>It used to be that dogs were given names such as Fido, Spot and Rover. Those days are long gone."Pets are a member of the family," said Anabel Conner, who has three dogs -- Sheba, Fawn and Ella."The trend in naming pets is going toward more human names," said Conner, who is also the community leader of Parents Connect.Parents Connect also provides a database of more than 11,000 dog and 27,000 baby names atPetNamesWorld.comand BabyNamesWorld.com.Conner, who considers herself a name expert, said that in addition to choosing names that are more human like, there are a few rules that dog owners should follow.She said it is important to use vowel sounds and give a name that has no more than two syllables."They can really pick up on them. It gets too complicated with more than that, but give a name with a punch to it," she said, because a pet's name is crucial in training."Any pet, as soon as they can ID their name, (that) is the first step in training," Conner said.Three syllable names are OK for pets other than dogs and cats, however."You can name your snake Cleopatra," she said. "It's not going to come."She followed the rules when naming her dogs, although Fawn's name was really difficult to come up with."She is a husky. I wanted something to do with nature but, as she was a member of my family, too, I just wanted her to have a name that a person could have, too," Conner said.Conner said she really likes the name Ella, so that name was easy."Ella is a name I have always liked, and in my job as a name expert, compiling data and giving advice about baby names to people all the time -- it is one that I had seen that I really liked," she said. "It is a very popular name, though, and one that I wouldn't use for a child of my own, only because I see so many little Ellas and Bellas being named every day."Lori Krout, creator ofDog-Paw-Print.com, agrees that dogs are being given more human names.Her website uses research from the Veterinary Pet Insurance, one of the country's largest pet insurance companies. VPI provides the names given by the policyholders. Krout said they track names for dogs, cats, birds, reptiles and exotics.Krout said the trend toward using human names is driven by people who view their pets like children."Dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations. People would keep them outside in a dog house," Krout said. "Nowadays, they are in the house, even sleeping in the bed sometimes."Krout also has a few guidelines for naming a dog."Have fun, be creative and maybe use a theme," she said. "Also, think about that you will be calling it this all the time, so you don't want it to be some long, crazy name."Krout said that "theme names" for families with more than one pet commonly come from movies and books, such as Thelma and Louise, or Gable and Bogart.Krout even chose to give one of her dogs a name from a book. She has Otis, Sofie and Guinevere, who is usually called Guinny.She said Guinevere is named after a character in "Camelot."For fans of Harry Potter, Krout has compiled a list ofpossible pet namesfrom the popular series.Her Web site also has a list of dog names withAustralian originfor breeds such as the Australian cattle dog and Australian shepherd. They include names such as Bikkie and Ace. The meanings are also included.Some people believe that giving a dog a name ending with the vowel O may make a dog think that the owner is saying, "No."Krout said she does not believe this rule is true.She pointed to the popular dog name Coco. It is No. 16 on the list of popular girl dog names.No email address was supplied by.

Find out how putting up a fence can help keep you and your family safe.<COL>iStock / akurtzBy Chaya Kurtz,NetworxCoyotes have colonized most major cities, including Chicago andNew York City. While spotting wildlife can be exciting, there are compelling reasons to discourage coyotes from living on your property. Coyotes are naturally afraid of humans, but as they get used to living with humans they get less and less fearful, and can become aggressive. Pets, like dogs and cats, look like tasty treats to coyotes, as well. You will live more peacefully with coyotes if you have less contact with them, and if they remain afraid of you.There are some benefits of having coyotes around in the suburbs and cities. As natural predators of rodents, they do a bang up job of controlling rat and mouse populations during certain times of the year. If you happen to like coyotes, another benefit is having them around as a subject for photos and observation. (That’s a bit weak when it comes to defining a benefit, I know.) In general, coyotes are regarded with disdain due to the fact that they become aggressive toward humans once they’ve acclimatized to human-dense environments. Though they do help to control rodent populations at certain times of the year, coyotes have also reduced the populations of native species like the Red Fox. They also do considerable damage to the productivity of American goat and sheep ranches.The first line of defense against coyotes is to avoid attracting them. Coyotes can adapt to any environment that provides food, water, shade, and space. Keeping food sources, especially garbage, scarce is your first priority. TheCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildliferecommends putting garbage into garbage cans that cannot be opened by coyotes and cannot be tipped over. TheBoulder County municipalityrecommends removing as many rodents from your yard and garden as possible, since coyotes are attracted to rodents. Animal control experts in Denver recommend picking up fruit that falls in your yard, as coyotes are also attracted to fruit as a food source (their diet is about 20 percent fruit). This should go without saying: Never feed coyotes, no matter how cute they look.Pets and pet food are also attractive to coyotes. Clean up spilled pet food outdoors. Pestcontrol experts in Denverrecommendthat you bring all pets inside at night, and that during the day you refrain from letting cats and dogs roam free.If you happen to come face to face with a coyote, do your best to scare it away. Remember, if coyotes become comfortable around humans, they eventually become aggressive. The worst thing you can do if you see a coyote in your neighborhood is do nothing, or to turn your back to it. Scream, yell, wave your arms, and throw rocks toward it (animal rights people: I am not saying to hit it with rocks, I am saying throw rocks to scare it. There is a difference.)Fencing is another way to keep coyotes off of your property, but it is not quite as effective as removing food sources. Wire mesh fencing of a height of at least five feet is the most effective fencing to protect against coyotes. Coyotes will burrow under fences, so installing a line of barbed wire helps to stop that. Installing rollers at the top of the fence will prevent the coyotes from getting the foothold necessary to clear the fence.Lights are another way to repel coyotes. Coyotes don't like loud noises and flashing lights. Installing motion-sensor lights, or like, launching a night club, in your yard will help to discourage coyotes from prowling there. Your neighbors will prefer the motion-sensor lights to the raging bass and colored strobes. You've been warned.With all this said, you should now understand that coyotes don't like loud noises and bright lights, but they do like foods like fruit from trees, garbage, and pets. Although they are beautiful animals, you don't want coyotes to get comfortable around humans in your area, because coyote comfort around humans = coyotes more likely to initiate contact with humans.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/how-to-keep-coyotes-out-of-your-yardDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

AST spokesperson Megan Peters says a tribal employee with the Old Harbor Native Corp. shot the bear.“Further investigation revealed (the sow) had been digging under an electric fence that was installed at the Old Harbor landfill for the past couple of months, entering the landfill and was eating trash,” troopers wrote. “The Old Harbor VPSO, members of the tribe, and landfill workers attempted to stop the bear from doing so by using multiple hazing methods which had worked in the past.”Peters says the landfill has been an ongoing draw to bears in the region, despite measures at the site to discourage them such as the electric fence and double fences. U.S. Marines working on a runway project in the community have also been using heavy equipment to place rocks blocking gaps in the fences.“It’s so popular, because bears have been going for years and years and years, that people bring others to see the bears,” Peters said.Humans aren’t the only ones who have learned to visit the landfill over time, according to Peters.“The bear that was shot there is believed to have been brought there when it was a cub, and ever since it was an adult it’s been bringing its own cubs,” Peters said. “It’s been, for the last couple of years, a problem bear apparently.”In accordance with policy on shootings to defend life and property, the sow’s skull and hide have been sent to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.“The sow was found to be very emaciated with almost no layers of fat and she was blind in one eye,” troopers wrote.While Peters didn’t have immediate details on the charging incident Monday, she says numerous cases of bears charging people have been reported over the years at the landfill.Larry Van Daele, Fish and Game’s Kodiak area biologist, was out of the office for the day Tuesday and couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.The sow’s cubs have not been seen at the landfill since the shooting, troopers say.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Eherenman told me the cheese flavor was from nutritional yeast, the yellow-Velveeta color from roasted red bell peppers, there was a deep rich flavor from the liquid smoke.“This is powerful stuff,” Eherenman said as he showed me how to make a dip he calls cheesy-beany spread.Eherenman says he went vegan about seven years ago to improve his health. His knees had been hurting. He thought he’d developed arthritis after years of backpacking through Alaska. He says he had terrible cholesterol and high blood pressure. He was constipated and had hemorrhoids. And the snoring, it was awful.“I couldn’t sleep at night,” Eherenman said.So he became a vegan. Eherenman says all his health problems went away. He’s hiking again.Now, to be honest, I’m not cut out to be a vegan. I love cheese way too much to give it up. I can’t imagine brunch without eggs Benedict and bacon or sausage.

Eventually other people on the trail safely encountered the group at the scene."Two joggers walked back with them for like a mile," Coltrane said.Coltrane says the joggers ran the rest of the way back to the nature center, and the hikers were en route there Wednesday afternoon.According to APD spokesperson Jennifer Castro, police received a 911 call at 12:41 p.m. Wednesday from the man, who said the bears were blocking the group's return to the nature center about four miles away from the facility.“The call got disconnected and we were unable to get back in contact with him,” Castro said.Jurisdiction over the matter had fallen to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as well as Chugach State Park, with park rangers also sent to the area to check on the hikers.Coltrane says she hasn't directly spoken with the man, but has his cellphone number and plans to call him. She encourages hikers to consider where they're traveling, carry bear spray, mind their surroundings and stay flexible."Be prepared to change your plans when you're in the backcountry," Coltrane said.Channel 2's Clinton Bennett contributed information to this story.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Employees from two Seward tour operators, Kenai Fjords Tours and Major Marine Tours, named the otters for marine landmarks in the area.“Agnes, now a healthy 15-pound, 3-month old female, was found stranded as a newborn near Homer, Alaska in April,” center staff wrote. “The other otter is a 18-pound, 4-month old male named Nuka, who was brought to the Center on June 1 after being reported as abandoned on Kodiak Island.”According to Brett Long, the center’s husbandry director, the nature of the otters’ handling is shifting, since they have been deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service due to their maternal care.“We are now transitioning their care to manage them as independent, young-adult otters,” Long said. “It is important that they learn to take care of themselves, while we continue to provide 24-hour care.”While the otters both required significant amounts of hands-on care, SeaLife Center officials say they are now eating 25 to 30 percent of their body weight daily as they move to an adult diet of squid and clams.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

AST spokesperson Megan Peters says a tribal employee with the Old Harbor Native Corp. shot the bear.“Further investigation revealed (the sow) had been digging under an electric fence that was installed at the Old Harbor landfill for the past couple of months, entering the landfill and was eating trash,” troopers wrote. “The Old Harbor VPSO, members of the tribe, and landfill workers attempted to stop the bear from doing so by using multiple hazing methods which had worked in the past.”Peters says the landfill has been an ongoing draw to bears in the region, despite measures at the site to discourage them such as the electric fence and double fences. U.S. Marines working on a runway project in the community have also been using heavy equipment to place rocks blocking gaps in the fences.“It’s so popular, because bears have been going for years and years and years, that people bring others to see the bears,” Peters said.Humans aren’t the only ones who have learned to visit the landfill over time, according to Peters.“The bear that was shot there is believed to have been brought there when it was a cub, and ever since it was an adult it’s been bringing its own cubs,” Peters said. “It’s been, for the last couple of years, a problem bear apparently.”In accordance with policy on shootings to defend life and property, the sow’s skull and hide have been sent to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.“The sow was found to be very emaciated with almost no layers of fat and she was blind in one eye,” troopers wrote.While Peters didn’t have immediate details on the charging incident Monday, she says numerous cases of bears charging people have been reported over the years at the landfill.Larry Van Daele, Fish and Game’s Kodiak area biologist, was out of the office for the day Tuesday and couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.The sow’s cubs have not been seen at the landfill since the shooting, troopers say.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Cold Bay has an all-weather airport that King Cove residents say they need access to, especially when there is a medical emergency."In terms of doing an evacuation out of King Cove, it's one of the worst conditions, if not the worst for a community that the Coast Guard services in the entire state," said Sen. Lisa Murkowski who has long advocated for the road to be built.Sen. Murkowski and Secretary Jewell took a tour of the local clinic and listened to staff as they shared some of the challenges they face with limited access to an all-weather airport. Depending on the weather, medical treatment is sometimes delayed for hours if a medevac flight is unable to land in King Cove.Etta Kuzakin, president of the Agdaagux Tribal Council, lost a child when she went into early labor and could not get to Anchorage in time for a C-section."If I was able to get from here to Cold Bay much earlier, if there was a road that could've taken me, I would've had four children right now and not three," said Kuzakin. "There's nothing more important than human life."Kuzakin had another scare in March, when at 8 months pregnant, she went into labor and had to wait hours for the Coast Guard to transport her to Cold Bay, before she could be flown to Anchorage. She shared her story at a community meeting that Secretary Jewell and Sen. Murkowski attended."Had I not been able to get out, she, nor I would be here to tell our stories," said Kuzakin as she held her 5 month-old baby.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service rejected a plan in February, that would have allowed the road, citing environmental concerns over critical habitat in the refuge. As part of the proposed Izembek Land Exchange, the state and the King Cove Corporation would give the federal government 56,000 acres of land in exchange for 206 acres for the road corridor.Secretary Jewell says it will be a difficult decision. She says she will review all of the material before making a reason judgement, based on all of the facts."It's certainly a very passionate community that has been vocal in its interests and that has been clear as well so I want to make sure that I respect the facts that are there and take all of them into account," said Jewell.She did not provide a time frame as to when she expects to make her decision.Contact Abby Hancock:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Williams, of Salem Oregon, and 65-year-old James L. Minton 65, of Wilkesboro, North Carolina, near Nondalton, between Lake Clark and Iliamna Lake, 190 miles southwest of Anchorage.The men were found about eight miles away from the downed airplane shortly before 1 p.m. Sunday, according to AST.“They were walking toward Nondalton,” Megan Peters, AST spokesperson, said. “The men appear to be in fair condition.”Family members of Minton in North Carolina say he’s an avid outdoorsman and it was his third visit to Alaska to hunt moose and fish.“My understanding is they went out to scout for a place to have a moose camp and maybe do some moose hunting, and that's when whatever's happened has happened,” Matthew Minton, son of James Larry Minton, said.Both men were taken to Iliamna via an Alaska Wildlife Trooper helicopter.“AWT and AST pilots and ground personnel were instrumental in locating the aircraft and the missing men safely,” Peters said.This is a developing story.

Williams, of Salem Oregon, as the pilot of a yellow Piper J-3 plane and 65-year-old James L. Minton 65, of Wilkesboro, North Carolina, as the passenger. They were scheduled to return Thursday in the Lake Clark area.“They were reported to have a rifle in the plane but no other survival gear,” said Megan Peters, AST spokesperson.The Rescue Coordination Center reported the small plane overdue shortly after 2:30 p.m. Friday near the Lake Clark area, west of Cook Inlet.The RCC, AST, and Alaska Wildlife Troopers searched the area for several hours and were not able to detect an ELT. Weather deteriorated around 7 p.m. Friday, according to troopers.On Saturday, the Department of Public Safety had five aircrafts from the Bristol Bay area search designated areas for the plane.“Both families have been contacted by AST and are aware of the search effort in progress,” said Peters.Contact Neil TorquianoCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Even though the fire was sparked by Fort Wainwright artillery training which took place after a red-flag alert was issued for the region, BLM will assume the costs of the fire, due to a special agreement with the U.S. Army Alaska that has been in place since 1995."The Alaska Fire Service provides non-reimburseable wildland fire management services to the U.S. Army Alaska, in exchange for support services that we get from the Army that includes facilities and utilities," Slater said.Slater says the costs of fighting the fire quickly added up, due to its location on Eielson Air Force Base requiring more air resources."The original start of the fire was on an ammunitions impact area which did not allow us to put firefighters on the ground because of unexploded ordnances," Slater said. "So from that respect, we had to fight the fire from the air."According to data from the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center, efforts to fight other top-priority blazes this summer have also cost millions of dollars. More than $4 million has been spent against the Skinny's Road fire, while the Lime Hills fire and the Moon Lake Complex -- six wildfires currently burning near Tok -- have cost nearly $3 million apiece.Slater says some wildfires are paid for by the state and some by federal agencies, depending on whether the they started on land managed by the state Division of Forestry, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or BLM.Contact Abby Hancock:EmailFacebookTwitter(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Longtime resident Walter Larson, who is a member of the Alaska Provincial Board says the population can swell to 7,500 people in the summertime.The southwestern community that sits along the banks of the Kuskokwim River is located about 400 miles west of Anchorage.Long before the town had even 1,000 people, the site was a trading post before missionaries of the Moravian Church established the city in the 1880s.Larson says Sheldon Jackson and a group of Presbyterians were traveling to other places around the state at the time and eventually found out Bethel didn't have any churches."He went to his own church, the Presbyterians, ut they were too busy...they were up north already," Larson said. "They couldn't spare people to come here already, so he approached other denominations like the covenants."Members of the Moravian Church eventually agreed to send people to the Kuskokwim area in 1882, and they were able to convince others there was a need for pastors and churches. Bishop Jacob Nelson Sr. says missionaries that arrived soon learned there was a language barrier and something needed to be done to fix that if there was going to be any chance they could teach the locals the ways of the church."Most of our missionaries learned to talk in Yup'ik, so they learned and then worked with the people," Nelson said.Elders say before the churches were developed, the people made their home close to the Kuskokwim River for its closeness to the fish."The Kuskokwim is where we get our food from, our staple," Larson said.The location offers much more than proximity to fish, though. The community rests on vast, squishy, sponge-like tundra that is filled with berries that provide main ingredients for many traditional native foods.Eva Malvich, the Dir. Curator for the Yupiit Piciyarait Cultural Center, says following traditions like picking berries is what makes Bethel a unique balance of incorporating the modern ways of living with tradition."I just picked my 21st gallon of berries this year and I'm waiting for the frost so I can continue to pick my berries," Malvich said.Whether it's the traditions that keep people thriving in the town or adapting to the more modern way of life, it's a community with a strong sense of connection to one another.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Moore says the Bristol Bay Native Corporation commissioned the mural for the Covenant House, an organization that serves many Alaska Native youth.“Even if you live in Anchorage, at some level you’re touched by subsistence and the subsistence values because people ship you fish or dried fish or moose meat or whale from up north,” Moore said. “Everyone in the state is sharing constantly - I think those are good values for our youth to keep in mind.”Moore has painted several other murals in communities across the state. She says all of her murals have a special message and this one is about importance and values of subsistence.“I feel really blessed that they asked me to do it which means some of the work I've been doing on my own time is sending the right message out,” Moore said. “I believe that messages and artwork is really important.”Moore expects the project to be complete in a couple weeks depending on the weather.For nearly 25 years, the Covenant House has provided shelter and other services to homeless, runaway, and at-risk teens. The new crisis center, priced at $20 million, has been in the works for several years and will be located on 8 th Ave and A St.Editor’s Note: KTUU’s Abby Hancock contributed to this story.Contact Neil Torquiano(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Age can be determined by counting rings in an ear bone called an otolith.Tydingco says that estimating age can be difficult once rockfish reach a certain length and age.He says Liebman's fish was just a really good grower.(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

I didn’t trust Phil Eherenman with his mop of curly blonde hair and his assertions that eating vegan would taste good.<COL>I was skeptical. I didn’t trust Phil Eherenman with his mop of curly blonde hair and his assertions that eating vegan would taste good.You know, as in no milk, cheese, meat or fish. Then he handed me a bean quesadilla. I bit. It was cheesey, tangy, self-sufficient. How was it possible? Eherenman told me the cheese flavor was from nutritional yeast, the yellow-Velveeta color from roasted red bell peppers, there was a deep rich flavor from the liquid smoke.“This is powerful stuff,” Eherenman said as he showed me how to make a dip he calls cheesy-beany spread.Eherenman says he went vegan about seven years ago to improve his health. His knees had been hurting. He thought he’d developed arthritis after years of backpacking through Alaska. He says he had terrible cholesterol and high blood pressure. He was constipated and had hemorrhoids. And the snoring, it was awful.“I couldn’t sleep at night,” Eherenman said.So he became a vegan. Eherenman says all his health problems went away. He’s hiking again.Now, to be honest, I’m not cut out to be a vegan. I love cheese way too much to give it up. I can’t imagine brunch without eggs Benedict and bacon or sausage. I start my day with hot chocolate for breakfast. But, I do understand wanting a healthier lifestyle and having more vegetables in your diet just seems like a good plan.Eherenman, who teaches cooking classes, is amazingly passionate about being a vegan. He sold me on having more vegan dinners, although I probably won’t give up a meaty cheeseburger.Cheesy-Beany Spread1 can white beans, drained1tbsp. tahini2 tbsp. nutritional yeast1-2 tbsp. roasted red bell pepper1/2 tsp. garlic powder1/2 tsp. onion powder1/2 tsp. dijon mustard1/2 tsp. salt (only if not using canned beans)1 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice (or more to taste)a few drops of liquid smokeCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The top causes of death among adult women in the U.S. include heart disease, stroke, cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Take the first step to protect yourself by talking with your doctor about your risk factors for these conditions. Then get serious about reducing your risk.If you have health problems, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes, that increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, follow your doctor's treatment recommendations. Also be sure to consult your doctor about when you should have mammograms and other cancer screenings.While you can't eliminate risk factors such as family history, you can control many other risk factors for heart disease, stroke and cancer. For example:Many women don't realize that they're at risk of illness and even death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — which includes bronchitis and emphysema. Don't be caught off guard. To protect your respiratory health:It's important to understand the common health risks that women face, but don't feel intimidated. Instead, do whatever you can to lead a healthy lifestyle — including eating a healthy diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking and getting regular checkups. Simple preventive measures can go a long way toward reducing your health risks.Source: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/womens-health/WO00014/NSECTIONGROUP=2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The list is surprisingly short. The top causes of death among adult men in the U.S. are heart disease, stroke, cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The good news is that a few lifestyle changes can significantly lower your risk of these common killers.Take charge of your health by making healthier lifestyle choices. For example:Don't wait to visit the doctor until something is seriously wrong. Your doctor can be your best ally for preventing health problems. Be sure to follow your doctor's treatment recommendations if you have health issues, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes. Also, be sure to ask your doctor about when you should have cancer screenings and other health evaluations.Another common cause of death among men are motor vehicle accidents. To stay safe on the road, use common sense. Wear your seat belt. Follow the speed limit. Don't drive under the influence of alcohol or any other substances, and don't drive while sleepy.Suicide is another leading men's health risk. An important risk factor for suicide among men is depression. If you have signs and symptoms of depression — such as feelings of sadness or unhappiness and loss of interest in normal activities — consult your doctor. Treatment is available. If you're contemplating suicide, call for emergency medical help or go the nearest emergency room.Understanding health risks is one thing. Taking action to reduce your risks is another. Start with healthy lifestyle choices — eating a healthy diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking and getting recommended health screenings. The impact may be greater than you'll ever know.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mens-health/MC00013/NSECTIONGROUP=2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

It's in a crowded strip mall in the back, just look for the black sign.It's a family owned business with Haesoo Kim, a mother, and husband and their daughters, doing all the cooking, serving and bookkeeping themselves.Kim is quick, churning out about six different meals in half an hour. Some of the vegetables she cuts are from her garden in Muldoon. Mama Kim doesn't speak English, so her daughter Yudee translates.She tells us that when you eat Korean food, you split several dishes, so everyone can try something.Meals start with Banchan, which is basically translated to side dish. If you never had Korean food, then picture about eight small bowls with vegetables, including bean sprouts, potatoes, kimchi or fish cakes.As our group sat at a small table, Mama Kim kept bringing out more and more food.BBQ spare ribs, soup and dolsot bibimbap with it's fried egg perched on top of mounds of vegetables, rice and served in a sizzling hot stone pot.Since this meal was about learning, I asked Yudee what people say before a meal."Ghal muk gae sum nida."She says it translate loosely to, "I will eat well, thank you so much for cooking."Sounds about right.For more food stories, check out the AK Bites archives.Contact Rebecca PalshaCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

News of bear attacks is up, and densely-populated regions across North America are taking steps to protect both bears and people. It’s possible for everyone to live in harmony, but it’s going to take a little work from the humans in the equation.Why the heck are bears so into human communities anyway? Don’t they have bear-like things to do in the wild? Well, “the wild” is actually shrinking; habitat is being eaten at an alarming rate each year as a result of commercial, residential, and agricultural development. That puts pressure on bears to find new places to live, and to seek out new food sources, because their natural supplies of fish, berries, and plants are dwindling.Human communities offer something bears want, especially in August and September, when they’re preparing for a long hibernation: food. Most neighborhoods, as well as campsites, are like an all-you-can-eat buffet, open 24 hours a day for any bear enterprising enough to take a little stroll and see what’s available. Once bears learn that a neighborhood has one or more food sources, they’ll be back again and again; kind of like how your kids won’t go away once you start feeding them!If a community doesn’t have any food, bears might pass through, but they’re unlikely to cause any damage. They’re naturally pretty shy, and don’t really want to deal with humans if they can avoid it, although they may lash out if they’re diseased, feel threatened, or think they need to protect cubs. By keeping a community’s food supplies locked up, which involves working with everyone who lives there, it’s possible to encourage bears to move on to greener pastures -- and to stay wild.For starters, no loose food should be stored outside. All pet and livestock feed should be kept in bear-proof containers in secured areas like locked sheds, and if animals are fed outside, they should only be fed enough to supply their needs for a meal. Better yet, feed pets and livestock when they’re tucked indoors for the night, and make sure homes, stables, and similar structures are secured. If you feed birds, keep the feeders at least 20 feet off the ground and four to six feet away from tree trunks to make them hard to reach.If you’re a gardener, you’ll want to take some extra steps to avoid feeding the bears with your hard-grown produce! Harvest fruits and veggies as soon as they ripen, and keep your compost in a tightly-secured area. Consider adding lime to cut down on food smells. You may want to consider an electric fence to keep bears out of orchards, gardens, and other areas, and that goes double for bee hives, which bearsadore.Remember Winnie the Pooh? Yeah, it’s less cute when it’s an actual black bear homing in for a snack.For even better bear control when it comes to compost, consider composting grass and plant clippings outdoors, and using avermicompostingsystem in the kitchen or a secure shed. You can compost food waste there and add it to the soil when it’s mature, all while keeping it away from the sharp noses of ursine visitors. Either way, do not add animal products like bones to the compost, as these can be bear attractants even after the compost has broken down.You’re going to need to get your neighbors on board with this plan so that when bears pop by for a round of shopping, they’ll find that all the stores are closed. If some of your neighbors can’t afford bear-proof containers and other safety measures, consider creating a community fund or applying for assistance from government agencies. Make sure that everyone, including children, is educated about keeping food products out of range of bears.And when bears do show up, make it clear that they need to move along. If you see a bear in the street or your yard and you cansafelydo so, make some noise. Clatter pan lids, use a wooden spoon on a pot, or use a bullhorn to startle the bear and encourage it to get out of the neighborhood. Do this from the safety of your home, but before you do so, check to make sure no one’s out in the street; a neighbor could be harmed if the bear startles.If you notice a recurring visitor or a bear won’t leave, call your local division of wildlife services and ask for assistance. They can monitor the bear and remove it, if necessary, relocating it to a safer location where it can live out its natural life in conditions more appropriate for wildlife. Be aware that the longer bears have to get accustomed to living around humans, the harder it can be for them to return to the wild.And, we hope it goes without saying: don’t feed the bears!Source: http://www.networx.com/article/tips-for-living-near-bearsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Across the state of Alaska there are approximately 300 public use cabins available for rent, according to the Alaska Public Lands Information Center.Deputy Director and Chief of Field Operations for Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation Claire LeClair said, "What they provide for the public is sort of a softer camping experience. So you don't have to bring your tent or a bunk, but other than that, you need to bring everything."Most cabins are furnished with bunks, a wood burning stove and an outhouse. LeClair explained that means users are encouraged to bring firewood, sleeping bags, toilet paper, food and utensils."It's all you need. It's a place to eat, play games, read, sleep and wood stove,” said public use cabin user Tamara Zellers. “That’s all you really need, so it's nice."Zellers said she was camping at the Bald Lake Cabin near Willow. That Bald Lake Cabin was built a decade ago and is only a quarter-mile from the Bald Lake Trail Head. Some cabins, however, are only accessible by boat or plane and many require at least a 3-mile hike. The private locations are something that attracts cabin users year-round.LeClair says in the past three years the Department of Natural Resources has added at least three or four cabins to the system and they expect to see more added in the future.In addition to DNR's list of public use cabins other entities operate cabin rentals in Alaska, including The National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Land Management and The National Forest.According to Tongass National Forest staff,The Denver Caboosecould be one of the oldest Public Use Cabins in Alaska. It is an original railroad car from the Klondike gold rush used on the White Pass and Yukon Route in the early 1890s. It was refurbished to be a cabin in the 1990s.Other public use cabins with deep history include Slavens Roadhouse. According tothe National Park Service website, the Slaven Roadhouse, found in the Yukon- Charley Rivers National preserve, was built in 1932 by Frank Slaven, Sandy Johnson, Alfred Johnson, Arthur Reynolds and Ed Brown. It has since been refurbished and serves as a drop-dog point during the Yukon Quest dog sledding race.According to DNR staff, while anyone can rent public use cabins, Alaskan's do get a perk. Residents can book a cabin 7 months in advance. While tourists booking opportunities are one month shorter, in both cases it's up to users to maintain the cabin. DNR staff do check on cabins, but not after every visit."We really ask the folks who rent the cabins to be very responsible about leaving the cabin in good shape," LeClair said. "Don’t leave any food in the cabins especially in areas that have bears, which is just about everywhere in Alaska."The only mark you're encouraged to leave is a note in each cabins unique log book."We have log books in the cabins and being able to read some of those, some will bring tears to your eyes and some will make you roll on the floor laughing," said Public Information Center Manager Kathy Johnson, "People have the gambit of time, you know, with their recreation."Whether it is recreation or quiet time, a public use cabin offers something for everyone.To rent a public use cabin visit theAlaska Public Lands Information Centers websitewhere you can find a full list of public use cabins across the state.ContactMallory Peebles(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Then, you were late for work. And on your way home, the car had a flat tire, making you miss your daughter's softball game.Now you've got this throbbing headache that has gone from a minor annoyance to a major jackhammer pounding away in your skull.And this jackhammer crew keeps busy: An estimated 45 million Americans suffer from chronic headaches, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the American College of Physicians. In fact, for half that number, that pounding pain will be severe and possibly disabling.For most of us, though, relief is as close as the medicine cabinet: About 90 percent of all headaches are harmless episodes that can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers—alone or together with rest, ice packs, or relaxation techniques.Most often, that pain is caused by one of two things:In general, headaches fall into three classes: tension, migraine, and cluster.The most common type of headache (accounting for about 90 percent) is the tension type. Some people describe them as a band of pressure or tightness around the head, at the back of the neck, or at the base of the skull. Some can last weeks, months -- even years.A lot of stress factors contribute to headaches, says the National Headache Foundation. The first step in controlling chronic headache pain is pinpointing the nature of its causes and symptoms.Unlike tension headaches, you can blame migraines on those temporary changes in the diameter of blood vessels serving the brain and scalp.While some people call any severe headache a migraine, the real thing is usually much more intense -- throbbing pain accompanied by nausea and even vomiting. Migraines can also bring visual changes and heightened sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells.Migraines affect more than 29.5 million Americans, who often inherit the affliction. Research has also shown ties to diet, stress, menstruation, and environmental changes.Cluster headaches bedevil about a million Americans, mostly men and mostly at night. Like migraines, cluster headaches follow changes in the brain's blood flow. Unlike migraines, they last less than an hour and occur in predictable "clusters," three- to eight-week periods in which they can strike several times a day.Cluster headaches produce extremely severe pain, incapacitating victims even more than migraines. But cluster headaches can enter long periods of remission.Doctors aren't sure what causes migraines or cluster headaches, but they've identified foods and food additives that can trigger a headache.Have you heard of "Chinese restaurant syndrome"? It's the headache some of us get after a favorite Chinese meal. It comes from the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), also found in some frozen foods, lunch meats, canned and dry soups, and many other processed foods.Then there's a class of chemicals called nitrites, used to preserve bacon, sausage, canned ham, smoked fish, and other meats. Nitrites can affect the body much the same way as low levels of serotonin-blood vessels in the brain dilate, sometimes producing a headache.And certain foods that contain tyramine, such as hard cheeses, peas, navy and lima beans, fresh bread, yogurt, alcoholic beverages, and chocolate, might trigger headaches -- especially in people who get migraines.The NINDS recommends preventive treatment if you experience three or more headaches every month. Ditto if your headaches are increasingly unresponsive to OTC medications.No email address was supplied by.

The Joint Board will take a look at over 40 proposals; many of the proposals concern the advisory committees that inform the two boards.Currently, Alaska has five areas where subsistence hunting and fishing is not permitted.One proposal would eliminate those non-subsistence areas. Others would modify subsistence boundaries near Fairbanks and create two new non-subsistence areas for Bethel and Kodiak. A substance priority does not apply in non-subsistence areas.According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, if the proposals are approved, then it would change where people can participate in a subsistence fishery or a subsistence hunt, not who can participate.“The boards may allow commercial fishing, the boards may allow personal use fishing, they may allow sport fishing or general hunting but not something that's labeled subsistence hunting and fishing,” said James Fall, ADFG Statewide Program Manager for the Division of Subsistence.The meeting begins at 8:30 a.m., Saturday in downtown Anchorage at the Hilton Hotel. The general public is invited to attend or sign-up to testify prior to the deadline of 10 a.m. Sunday.A live audio stream of the meeting will be available on the Joint Board of Fisheries and Gamewebsite.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Sean Parnell had threatened to sue unless the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reversed its shutdown of federal refuges in Alaska by the close of business Tuesday.

Ticks, which are common on hares, and water contaminated with a dead animal, as well as ticks, can also spread the bacteria to animals and people.”About one human case of tularemia every two years is reported in Alaska. While the disease can be fatal without treatment using antibiotics, sufferers more commonly exhibit skin ulcers, pain and swelling in lymph glands, mouth sores, a sore throat, fevers or flu-like symptoms, pneumonia or diarrhea.ADFG wildlife biologist Cathie Harms says the recent outbreak of tularemia has cropped up rather quickly, with most cases typically linked to annual infections of hares by the ticks that carry it between Memorial Day and Labor Day.“It’s happened over the past few days, perhaps a week or so, and at least two dead animals that I know of,” Harms said. “We spend the winter not thinking of this disease because we don’t have any reported cases.”Fish and Game urges people to avoid direct contact with sick hares, bury dead hares or throw them away in double bags, and not drink untreated water from streams populated by muskrats or beavers. Squirrels and voles can also be infected by ticks.“Signs that a hare is infected include lack of fear of people, ‘tameness,’ lethargy, and sudden death,” officials wrote. “People can protect themselves by using gloves or a plastic bag if they have to touch a dead hare, and washing their hands afterwards.”While the disease is usually confined to hot spots, including the one Fish and Game is monitoring near North Pole, Harms says it has the potential to occur statewide. No reports of people being infected have yet come in, and spreading knowledge about tularemia helps contain it.“It’s much more rare for people to get this than pets, but part of the reason we need people to know about this is to prevent that,” Harms said. “We need people to know what they might look like if exposed to tularemia, and what their pets might look like if they’re exposed.”Infected pets can spread tularemia through bites but can also be protected from the disease’s effects, if their owners keep them away from snowshoe hares and remain observant. Animal symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and swollen lymph nodes.“If your cat or dog starts looking unwell, take it to a vet,” Harms said. “It can be cured -- you just have to watch out for it.”Anyone who notices sick hares is asked to call Fish and Game at 907-459-7206.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The problem bear in Eagle River reached a point where authorities had to step in and shoot it.“It's our policy when we see a repeated behavior by a food-conditioned brown bear as this one was, showing the same behavior night after night in this neighborhood, that our only option really is to put it down,” said Fish and Game biologist Jessy Coltrane.Martin says she has her two children run to the car, just in case a bear wanders through their neighborhood.“We've seen it on the road at least four times I know of,” Martin said. “It broke down our Arctic entry door and kicked (it) down, because it was trying to get in through the window.”Fish and Game blames the incident on neighbors who haven't taken care of their trash. Officials have issued two $310 citations for negligent feeding of wildlife to residents, one of whom was identified in a Thursday trooper dispatch as 71-year-old Karen Johnson.Some residents are already taking steps to better handle their trash, in a bid to avoid attracting bears and other animals.“Up until about a week and a half ago, we had put our trash out and it only had magazines,” said resident Maureen Otto. “And the bear got into it, so then we put it into the garage.”Fish and Game says people should secure their trash in garages, and only take it out on the morning when their trash is picked up -- steps which can help keep both people and wildlife safer.“People that leaving their trash out, they caused the death of this bear and they endangered people in their neighborhood,” Coltrane said. “So they created a public safety risk, and ultimately the bear paid the ultimate price.”Fish and Game says the bears are making a big push to gain calories before they go in to the dens in the winter, with brown bears possibly active until late November.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Information from 64-year-old mauling victim Robert Weaver’s wife, who fled inside the cabin during the attack, also contributed to the identification.Ipsen says the determination was delayed by reports that other bears may have been present in the region, which were investigated by troopers.“But that was the only bear that was seen in the area, both before the incident and after,” Ipsen said.Troopers learned of the mauling at about 6:45 p.m. Thursday, with both an AST helicopter and a UH-60 Black Hawk from Eielson Air Force Base responding in addition to an Alaska Wildlife Trooper in a jetboat. The wildlife trooper later shot and killed the bear, which returned after Weaver’s body was found at the scene.According to Ipsen, Weaver's wife told troopers the mauling occurred after the couple went boating on George Lake near the cabin."They were on their boat and they saw this bear as they were docking," Ipsen said.The Weavers yelled at the bear and it ran away, so they finished docking the boat and headed inside."As they were walking from the landing to the cabin, the bear came out of the woods and attacked," Ipsen said.Ipsen didn’t know whether any factors emerged during the bear's necropsy, such as malnutrition or wounds, which might help to explain the mauling.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Hollis asked neighbors to report when they spotted the moose and he was able to tranquilize it.The arrow's tip was embedded 4 to 5 inches into the bridge of the nose, so visiting vet Marianne Lian unscrewed the arrow and left the tip where it was.

Sometimes, though, holiday horticulture can cause some inconveniences, or worse.<COL>iStock/LiliboasThe holidays are a time of joy and family ... and plants. If you think about it, horticulture plays a surprisingly large part of the holiday season.We use evergreen Christmas trees, holly wreaths, poinsettias and other gift plants, and my favorite, mistletoe (and kissing beneath it!). All of these plants have great historical and symbolic meaning for the Christmas holiday.Sometimes, though, holiday horticulture can cause some inconveniences. Pine needles need to be swept up; water spilled or splashed while filling the tree stand needs to be mopped up; and soil from potted plants that are knocked over by kids or pets needs to be both swept and mopped.In some extreme cases, though, our use of plants during the holiday can lead to tragedy. Tree fires are not unheard of, and people and pets have been known to become sick after eating some of the greenery.Don't allow our glad times to become sad times! A little bit of forethought can "wrap up" these holiday challenges ...Dried-out Christmas treesCut trees are the centerpiece for Christmas decorating. But because of the dry indoor environment and their general lack of a root system, they dry out quickly. A dry tree is a flammable tree! Keeping the tree hydrated is an absolute must to keep your family safe.When you get your cut tree home, saw off the bottom of the trunk to expose some fresh wood. Immediately place the tree in a bucket of water, or in a tree stand with a full reservoir. A freshly cut tree will absorb a surprisingly large amount of water over the first several days, so be sure to check and replenish the reservoir at least two or three times a day.The various chemical additives that supposedly decrease the flammability of the tree aren't necessary. Plain old water works as well as anything; in fact, some of the additives may block the tree's ability to take up water; others can cause bacterial growth in the reservoir, or pose a health risk to pets.And for goodness sake, never use lit candles or frayed light strings on a tree.The next holiday horticulture disaster can really bug you ...Christmas tree pestsCut trees sometimes have their own organic tree ornaments already attached, in the form of egg sacs, cocoons and hibernating insects. After a few days in a nice, warm living room, they tend to hatch out, adding to the excitement of the holiday. Nothing like 100 baby praying mantises swarming the ornaments to liven up the party!Before bringing the tree indoors, check it for hitchhikers.Most egg sacs and cocoons will be located inside the body of the tree, hidden by the needles. Checking the tree while it's still lying down in the driveway gives you a better view of the undersides of the lower branches. Cocoons and webbing can be wiped off and removed. If you do find a praying mantis egg sac (they are grayish brown, about the size of a walnut), carefully remove it and tie it to a shrub or tree in your yard.Do not spray the tree with an insecticide. The chemical may make the tree more flammable, and it's not healthy to breathe in the vapors.Of course, sometimes it's the plant itself which can cause trouble ...Toxic plantsA popular myth is that poinsettias are poisonous. This has been proven to be not true.That being said, I wouldn't recommend adding one to your salad. It's always possible for someone to have an allergy to the plant (just like an allergy to strawberries); some people have been known to develop a skin irritation from the milky sap.The berries of mistletoe can be toxic in large numbers. This is especially a concern with small pets and very young children, where just a couple of berries can be enough to cause problems.

Then, about an hour later, he came down to what appears to be a den area for him," said Carillo.The California Department of Fish and Game did not respond to the incident because the bobcat would likely run off, Delimitros said.The animal did not attack anyone, according to the officer.By 6:45 p.m., the scene was cleared.It was unknown which direction the bobcat took off.No email address was supplied by.

The calf, born at midday Sunday, is the center’s fourth successful elk birth this year among its herd of 18 animals. Six wood bison calves have been born in AWCC’s larger herd of 130 to 140 bison, although Miller says the births have been delayed for both species.“Actually, they’re late -- I don’t know if it had something to do with the late spring,” Miller said.Miller says elk born at AWCC have previously been sent to farms on Point Mackenzie, but all of this year’s elk will be released on 65-square-mile Akun Island in the Aleutians -- countering the presence of non-native cattle introduced to the island chain in previous centuries.“These released elk will inhabit (the island) providing a new more natural use of subsistence for the village of Akutan,” Miller wrote. “Eight adult elk will accompany the calves.”Bruce Chisholm, a veterinarian who has supervised the release of 6,000 elk, has volunteered to accompany the elk to Akun Island. A female elk will be fitted with a radio collar, in an effort to let schoolchildren track the animals’ migration patterns.Miller says both bison and elk breeding have been restricted, primarily due to a shortage of land at the center. A U.S. Forest Service grant through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to buy more acreage should allow for more breeding in future years.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Follow these tips to keep them out of your yard.<COL>iStock / akurtzBy Chaya Kurtz,NetworxCoyotes have colonized most major cities, including Chicago andNew York City. While spotting wildlife can be exciting, there are compelling reasons to discourage coyotes from living on your property. Coyotes are naturally afraid of humans, but as they get used to living with humans they get less and less fearful, and can become aggressive. Pets, like dogs and cats, look like tasty treats to coyotes, as well. You will live more peacefully with coyotes if you have less contact with them, and if they remain afraid of you.There are some benefits of having coyotes around in the suburbs and cities. As natural predators of rodents, they do a bang up job of controlling rat and mouse populations during certain times of the year. If you happen to like coyotes, another benefit is having them around as a subject for photos and observation. (That’s a bit weak when it comes to defining a benefit, I know.) In general, coyotes are regarded with disdain due to the fact that they become aggressive toward humans once they’ve acclimatized to human-dense environments. Though they do help to control rodent populations at certain times of the year, coyotes have also reduced the populations of native species like the Red Fox. They also do considerable damage to the productivity of American goat and sheep ranches.The first line of defense against coyotes is to avoid attracting them. Coyotes can adapt to any environment that provides food, water, shade, and space. Keeping food sources, especially garbage, scarce is your first priority. TheCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildliferecommends putting garbage into garbage cans that cannot be opened by coyotes and cannot be tipped over. TheBoulder County municipalityrecommends removing as many rodents from your yard and garden as possible, since coyotes are attracted to rodents. Animal control experts in Denver recommend picking up fruit that falls in your yard, as coyotes are also attracted to fruit as a food source (their diet is about 20 percent fruit). This should go without saying: Never feed coyotes, no matter how cute they look.Pets and pet food are also attractive to coyotes. Clean up spilled pet food outdoors. Pestcontrol experts in Denverrecommendthat you bring all pets inside at night, and that during the day you refrain from letting cats and dogs roam free.If you happen to come face to face with a coyote, do your best to scare it away. Remember, if coyotes become comfortable around humans, they eventually become aggressive. The worst thing you can do if you see a coyote in your neighborhood is do nothing, or to turn your back to it. Scream, yell, wave your arms, and throw rocks toward it (animal rights people: I am not saying to hit it with rocks, I am saying throw rocks to scare it. There is a difference.)Fencing is another way to keep coyotes off of your property, but it is not quite as effective as removing food sources. Wire mesh fencing of a height of at least five feet is the most effective fencing to protect against coyotes. Coyotes will burrow under fences, so installing a line of barbed wire helps to stop that. Installing rollers at the top of the fence will prevent the coyotes from getting the foothold necessary to clear the fence.Lights are another way to repel coyotes. Coyotes don't like loud noises and flashing lights. Installing motion-sensor lights, or like, launching a night club, in your yard will help to discourage coyotes from prowling there. Your neighbors will prefer the motion-sensor lights to the raging bass and colored strobes. You've been warned.With all this said, you should now understand that coyotes don't like loud noises and bright lights, but they do like foods like fruit from trees, garbage, and pets. Although they are beautiful animals, you don't want coyotes to get comfortable around humans in your area, because coyote comfort around humans = coyotes more likely to initiate contact with humans.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/how-to-keep-coyotes-out-of-your-yardDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The bear was reportedly in the median of the highway after it was hit.“Unfortunately, the bear was still alive but injured,” Myren said. “It was a threat and needed to be dispatched.”Myren says the highway's southbound lanes were closed as police responded, but reopened by 4 p.m. Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologists were headed to the scene to collect the bear’s carcass Thursday afternoon.No injuries were reported by the SUV's occupants.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The person inside the cabin was found, as well as Weaver’s body outside it; no bear was immediately seen, and troopers contacted the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.“While the Alaska Wildlife Trooper was conducting the death investigation, a black bear wandered on scene,” troopers wrote. “The bear was dispatched by the Trooper. It is unknown if the dispatched bear is the same animal that reportedly mauled Weaver.”Weaver’s next of kin have been notified, and his body will be taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage for an autopsy.AST spokesperson Megan Peters says the other person was one of Weaver's next of kin. Troopers are still determining whether a follow-up interview will be conducted."Obviously, the other person who was present is going through an extremely difficult time," Peters said.According to Peters, the incident is highly suggestive of a bear mauling, but a formal conclusion as to its nature hasn't yet been made."We don't have any determination otherwise, but as always the autopsy will have the final determination," Peters said.The bear’s remains are being sent to Fish and Game for a necropsy.This is a developing story.

That work was estimated by the Department of Law to cost up to $2 million.(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sean Parnell and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to consider a proposed land swap between the state and federal governments, which would create a buffer zone along a section of the park in which wolves would be protected from trapping.The proposal comes as the National Park Service says it's getting harder to see wolves along the Denali Park Road.To many environmentalists, wolves are seen as a symbol of the Alaska wilderness -- but there's a growing faction, including biologist and conservationist Rick Steiner, that's now looking at wolves and seeing dollar signs from the tourism they inspire.“The state needs to understand the simple economics here, and that is that Denali wolves are worth far more alive than they are dead,” Steiner said. “And we all know that -- I think even the state knows that.”Steiner says wolf trapping outside the boundaries of Denali National Park is taking a toll on the park's wolves. He says a survey just released by the Park Service shows that seeing wolves in the park is becoming a rare occurrence for visitors.Of some 400,000 people who visit Denali annually, the survey shows only 4 percent reported seeing a wolf this summer. That's down dramatically from the 44 percent who spotted them in 2010.“It's not a predator control issue, it's not a hunting versus non-hunting, trapping versus no-trapping issue, it's simple economics,” Steiner said. “And the economics say we need to grow and sustain Denali's wildlife viewing economy, and this is the way to do it.”Along with other conservationists, Steiner says the way to do it is to establish a permanent buffer zone on state land along the Stampede Trail, near the town of Healy, in which the trapping of wolves that wander outside park boundaries would be banned.“The solution is for the state and Department of Interior to negotiate an easement, a permanent wildlife buffer for conservation easement east of Denali National Park, to protect wolves and perhaps bears from take,” Steiner said.In exchange for the easement, conservationists say the state would get another parcel of land or money.It's a deal Tim Striker, Denali National Park’s superintendent, supports.“In my mind, it's a good tradeoff -- win-win for the federal government and State of Alaska,” Striker said.Bob Mumford, a member of the state Board of Game, says he’s open to any and all ideas concerning wildlife, but doubts whether a permanent buffer zone would work.“If we've learned anything from the reintroduction of wolves in the Lower 48, wolves don't always stay where they are told to stay,” Mumford said. “We have a 6 million acre-plus park there; if we add a buffer zone, I believe the wolves will maybe re-den in the buffer zone, and then they are going to travel outside of that buffer zone.”Striker says while it's more difficult to find wolves along the park road, that doesn't mean the park's wolf population is in trouble.The latest count this spring shows 55 wolves living in the park, down from 66 last year. But wolf numbers fluctuate from year to year, and the Park Service says the population right now is at a healthy level.Meanwhile, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game says about two to four wolves are legally trapped in the Stampede area each winter. The department says that's not enough to impact the park's overall wolf population.What can affect the viewing of wolves is the type of wolf that's trapped. Two springs ago, an alpha female was legally trapped in the Stampede area. She was the lone breeding female in the Grant Creek pack that lived near the park road, and was perhaps the park’s most visible wolf pack.Since that alpha female was trapped park biologists say the pack has dissolved, with the other wolves going their separate ways.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

It's also home to a grapefruit tree that produces fruit, as well as a fig tree that has a few small figs.When you enter, you hear the parrots squawking and the burbling artificial brook. Colorful koi fish swim in the pond, under towering trees rooted right in the ground.  It's a place where some people come simply to relax and eat their lunches.Stephen Gray, the greenhouse's horticulture park foreman, says he's lucky to work here. At this time of year his crew is done with their busiest season, the summer months when they tend to plants for municipal properties across the city. Now they have more time for the public greenhouse.For the lifeforms at the greenhouse, it's a second chance. When people move and leave animals behind or when a plant gets too big, they come to the greenhouse."This greenhouse is a refuge for the orphaned birds and fish and plants," Gray said.Gray likens how they fare here to a life lesson."Some are going to do well and some aren't," Gray said. "You're going to have successes and you're going to have failures."Working here is a lesson in using what you've got. There are the long days of summer where everything grows, then the dark winters."It's too easy here in Alaska, especially in the winter to get caught up in the fact that there is no growth going on outside," Gray said.The greenhouse, at 1321 Lidia Selkregg Lane, is open every day from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is free.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

According to Magone, explosives placed inside of drilled holes in the rock and vessel will help break the wreckage free from the rocks that are impaling it. It is a common practice to use explosives in situations like this, he said."It's just one of the tools in the toolbox.  It's actually a very small part of this project. All the other methodology is the main thing," Magone said.It would be a multi-agency effort, with the help of the Alaska Dept. Of Fish and Game, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to make sure the blasts do not harm any wildlife."When it's time to set off the explosives, we have look-out that are maintaining a watch. So then before you set the explosives off, you check with everybody," Magone said.Once the vessel is free, the plan is to sink it and then pull it to shore and cut up the wreckage.When the 102-foot vessel ran aground on November 1, its crew was safely rescued by another fishing vessel. About 6,000 gallons of diesel fuel was removed from the ship but another 6,000 gallons of fuel and other fluids were lost, according to a Department of Environmental Conservation report.No email address was supplied by.

These are our five favorite deliciously bad foods.<COL>iStock / DrGroundsYou're home alone. The urge strikes. You head to the secret stash in the closet. Even though you know nobody's home, you look over both shoulders, twice.Your heart rate quickens. You know what you're doing is wrong, but you rationalize: "One more indulgence is all, and then I'll get rid of it. I'll never buy it again."You creep into the closet, move the pile of clothes, lift the floor board, and there it is, beckoning you forth. Nobody's going to find out. It's just you and the secret stash. A half-hour later, you're sprawled out on the bed, half conscious, realizing this won't be the last time, regardless of what you tell yourself.You know what you did was repulsive, but you just can't stop eating these five disgusting foods we love!Up first, care for a pastry that never gets old ... literally?No. 5: TwinkiesTwinkies are the food the fat kid you made fun of in school ate. If the fat kid, for example, came to school with a broken arm, it was because he climbed the rack at 7-11 and fell reaching for a Twinkie. Even after you found out the fat kid had a metabolic imbalance that caused his portly disfigurement, you still told "his blood is made of Twinkie filling" jokes.Of course you feel bad about that now because you also secretly enjoyed the yellow, spongy substance filled with white frosting-like cream, but were too embarrassed to tell anyone.In fact, your high school lost the state championship basketball game, not because you had the flu, but because you inhaled 13 Twinkies before getting on the bus and then vomited incessantly.And that Twinkie you left in the attic 13 years ago. It tasted just as good this morning as it would have then, especially after eating our next entry.After you've gobbled down that Twinkie, hit the drive-thru for our next fast food delight ...No. 4: Filet O' FishThe five disgusting foods we love list would not be complete without a sampling from the world of fast food, the only industry that could produce a square fish-like item, covered in fatty batter, that contains very little to no nutritional value.That's the Filet O' Fish sandwich, although it's uncertain whether the Filet O' Fish sandwich contains any actual fish. One 3-inch square does, according to Peertrainer.com, contain 400 calories and 18 grams of fat.Since eating one Filet O' Fish automatically leads to eating three Filets O' Fish, you will have consumed 1,200 calories and 54 grams of fat (not counting the nine packets of tartar sauce the fake fish swims in), and you still won't be sure what it was you ate.Scientists have agreed that the only way to make the Filet O' Fish sandwich better would be to cover it with nacho cheese.Which leads us to our No. 3 selection ...No. 3: Nacho cheeseIt's orange. It's cheese flavored. You could eat a pound of it while watching football. It makes you really fat. That's about where the similarities end between nacho cheese and actual cheese.There is no logical explanation for eating nacho cheese. It doesn't taste good. It's messy. It's unhealthy.That hasn't stopped you, however, from fantasizing about swimming naked in a river of nacho cheese while nacho cheese nymphs swim by wearing tortilla chip bikinis. It also hasn't stopped you from secretly scraping the clear plastic bottom of a discarded nacho plate at a baseball game in order to get a sample of the delicious radioactive-orange colored substance.The greatest moment in nacho cheese history occurred several years ago when Barney Jacklestomp used it as adhesive for a gingerbread house to leave out for Santa on Christmas Eve. Santa loves nacho cheese ... and cookies.No email address was supplied by.

Children in vehicles should be properly restrained using the appropriate safety equipment whether it be a seatbelt, a booster seat or a car seat.”Peters says troopers will also be on the lookout for drunk drivers throughout the holiday weekend. While Peters acknowledges that people may choose to drink during the long weekend, she urges Alaskans to neither drive drunk nor allow their friends and loved ones to do so.APD spokesperson Dani Myren says three additional officers will be on Anchorage streets for the campaign, ramping up to five more on Monday."Under Anchorage Municipal Code, a motorist or passenger age 16 or over found not wearing his or her seatbelt can be fined up to $60.00 plus a $10.00 surcharge; a driver with children under the age of 16 who are not properly restrained can be fined up to $200.00 plus a $10.00 surcharge," Myren wrote.Alaska’s waterways will also see a heightened focus on safety, as National Safe Boating Week begins Saturday. U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 3rd Class Jonathan Klingenberg says the event, timed to coincide with the Memorial Day weekend, tries to broaden the use of life jackets and prevent people from operating under the influence.“The Coast Guard reminds all boaters to boat responsibly while on the water and avoid the consumption of alcohol,” Klingenberg wrote in a statement. “The use of life jackets, emergency beacons, flares, float plans and appropriate communications devices are advised for anyone operating watercraft.”Klingenberg says many communities on Alaska’s coasts will have Coast Guard Auxiliarists on hand to offer vessel safety checks and safety classes. Details on those events have been posted on the Coast Guard Auxiliary’s National Safe Boating Week website.Alaskans staying ashore over the holiday are being asked by the state Division of Fire and Life Safety to avoid burn hazards, during activities ranging from starting campfires to burning debris during spring cleanup.“Please consider your safety, and the safety of others; do your part to prevent human-caused fires,” division spokesperson Maggie Rogers said in a statement. “Make sure campfires are completely extinguished, that fireworks are used carefully and only where legal, and adhere to burn permit regulations. If you build a campfire, make sure tools and water are available, do not leave the fire unattended, and properly dispose of smoking materials.”Rogers also asks that anyone who sees wildfires promptly call 911 to report them.Even if you’re staying home for the weekend, the state Department of Environmental Conservation is encouraging people to observe food-safety guidelines during meals and cookouts.DEC spokesperson Ty Keltner says foods should be thawed or marinated in the refrigerator, not on the counter. Raw meats shouldn’t be stored near ready-to-eat foods like fruits or vegetables.On the grill, meats should be cooked to temperatures of 165 degrees for chicken, 155 degrees for hamburgers and 145 degrees for steaks and fish. In addition, cooked meats shouldn’t be placed on unwashed plates that have held raw meat.After meals, Keltner says warm foods should be kept warm while cold foods should be kept cold, with any moved items kept at their temperatures in insulated totes. Any food that’s been outside for more than two hours should be thrown out.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.<COL>iStock/YinYangIt being the New Year's resolution season, the top things on everyone's lists seem to be eat healthy and save money.However, these aren't just goals to which we should aspire once a year. Everyone would probably agree that we always want to save money and we always want to eat healthy.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap. If you want another layer of protection, use a water filter. A $7 Brita filter cleans 40 gallons of water.Sure, a cup of water doesn't taste like a cold Coke, and sometimes you need that drink. But it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of your diet. Make the bulk of your fluid consumption water and have soda as an occasional treat.No. 4: Watch the adsGrocery stores do a great job of letting you know when they have sales. Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No email address was supplied by.

"Cows will be dropping calves all over town soon."May to early June is calving season for moose, making encounters with cows intent on protecting their calves from people and animals much higher. Last spring, several attacks by moose defending their calves were reported in the Anchorage area."If you're walking through a wooded area, you need to be extra vigilant," Coltrane said. "Those cows are so defensive of their little babies they will literally stand there on the edge of the woods watching you and if you take one step into their personal bubble, they'll come out hooves flying."Like moose, brown and black bear sows are equally protective of their young and may be seen around bike trails, neighborhoods, and urban greenbelts.The ADFG advises people to not assume young animals found alone are orphaned. The department says the mother is often nearby, so it is best to leave them alone.However, if a young animal is seen alone for an extended period of time or is believed to be a safety concern, call the nearest ADFG office.Contact Jessica RidgwayCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

When Perry was questioned, he said Sledge had shown up looking for somewhere to sleep, and was “high and drunk and smelled like lighter fluid.” After letting Sledge in, Perry told police he had walked to a Holiday gas station.“Perry said while he was on his way back from the Holiday store he received a call from Durfee saying Sledge was on fire,” Anderson wrote. “Perry said he ran home to find Sledge on fire. Perry said Sledge told him he was trying to light a cigarette when he caught fire.”Police spoke with Diane Perry, Trevor Perry’s grandmother. She told police that Perry and Durfee lived with her in an apartment at the complex, and that she also allowed a third man, Zione Frye-Collins, to stay at her home.Perry told police that Frye-Collins’ father had shown her text messages that suggested her grandson may have set Sledge on fire while she was at church.“At 1:28 p.m. on 2-10-13 Trevor wrote ‘hurry up n get back im still setting this (expletive) on fire,’” Anderson wrote. “Zione replied ‘wow.’”Perry subsequently told police that she wasn’t satisfied with Durfee and her grandson’s explanation of events. She also said she found a box of matches she used to light candles in their bedroom, and found matchsticks on the floor near where Sledge had been sleeping.“Diane said Elshandrea admitted throwing a liquid on Joseph to wake him up but Elshandrea refused to say what it was,” Anderson wrote.During a Feb. 20 interview, Sledge told Anderson that he had passed out on a bed in Trevor Perry’s room on the day of the incident.“(Sledge) said he woke up when Trevor and Elshandrea threw some liquid on him,” Anderson wrote. “Specifically, Joseph said Trevor and Elshandrea were both there, but that Elshandrea threw the liquid on him. He said the liquid smelled like gas but they told him it was water.”Afterward, Sledge moved to a living-room chair and fell asleep again, where he woke up on fire.“He said he was screaming for help but Trevor and Elshandrea did not help,” Anderson wrote. “I asked Joseph why they would do this to him and he said because ‘Trevor is crazy.’”When Anderson confronted Frye-Collins with the text messages Trevor Perry had sent him, he admitted he had been at a McDonald’s when he received them.“Zione said by the time he got back Joseph had already been lit on fire,” Anderson wrote. “Zione said Trevor was mad at Joseph for passing out on his bed and also for taking his car without permission the day before.”Trevor Perry and Durfee were arraigned Thursday afternoon.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The area south of the Kuskokwim River was formerly one of the best moose hunting areas, according to a DFG press release.DFG spokeswoman Cathie Harms explained a disproportionate number of black bear kills is due to the bear’s more efficient ability to target newborn moose. The area is also known to be populated with more black bears than grizzlies, too.“Black bears are incredibly efficient in targeting newborn moose,” Harms said.Harms explained the goal of the control program aims to get two years worth of calves from newly-born to adulthood without the threat of predation.“Calving has only just begun, and over the next four months we’ll see the biggest impact as the moose grow,” Harms said.Sows with cubs of the year were not removed, according to DFG officials.Department staff shot bears from a helicopter and brought them to Sleetmute, where the carcasses were skinned and meat was processed. Department staff distributed the meat and some hides to the villages of Aniak, Chauthbaluk, Crooked Creek, Lime Village, Kalskag, Red Devil, Sleetmute, and Stony River. The remaining hides would be sold at auctions in Fairbanks, Harms said.A wolf control program has been in effect in the same area since 2004, but according to DFG officials, reducing only wolf numbers has not had a measurable effect on moose numbers.Email Joshua StaabFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Unlike other fats, trans fat — also called trans-fatty acids — both raises your "bad" (LDL) cholesterol and lowers your "good" (HDL) cholesterol.A high LDL cholesterol level in combination with a low HDL cholesterol level increases your risk of heart disease, the leading killer of men and women. Here's some information about trans fat and how to avoid it.Trans fat is made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil through a process called hydrogenation, which makes the oil less likely to spoil. Using trans fats in the manufacturing of foods helps foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and have a less greasy feel.Scientists aren't sure exactly why, but the addition of hydrogen to oil increases your cholesterol more than do other types of fats. It's thought that adding hydrogen to oil makes the oil more difficult to digest, and your body recognizes trans fats as saturated fats.Commercial baked goods — such as crackers, cookies and cakes — and many fried foods, such as doughnuts and french fries — may contain trans fats. Shortenings and some margarines can be high in trans fat.Trans fat used to be more common, but in recent years food manufacturers have used it less because of concerns over the health effects of trans fat. Food manufacturers in the United States and many other countries list the trans fat content on nutrition labels.However, you should be aware of what nutritional labels really mean when it comes to trans fat. For example, in the United States if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, the food label can read 0 grams trans fat. Though that's a small amount of trans fat, if you eat multiple servings of foods with less than 0.5 grams of trans fat, you could exceed recommended limits.How do you know whether food contains trans fat? Look for the words "partially hydrogenated" vegetable oil. That's another term for trans fat.It sounds counterintuitive, but "fully" or "completely" hydrogenated oil doesn't contain trans fat. Unlike partially hydrogenated oil, the process used to make fully or completely hydrogenated oil doesn't result in trans-fatty acids. However, if the label says just "hydrogenated" vegetable oil, it could mean the oil contains some trans fat.Although small amounts of trans fat occur naturally in some meat and dairy products, it's the trans fats in processed foods that seem to be more harmful.Doctors worry about trans fat because of its unhealthy effect on your cholesterol levels — increasing your LDL and decreasing your HDL cholesterol. There are two main types of cholesterol:A high LDL cholesterol level is a major risk factor for heart disease. If your LDL is too high, over time, it can cause atherosclerosis, a dangerous accumulation of fatty deposits on the walls of your arteries. These deposits — called plaques — can reduce blood flow through your arteries. If the arteries that supply your heart with blood (coronary arteries) are affected, you may have chest pain and other symptoms of coronary artery disease.If plaques tear or rupture, a blood clot may form — blocking the flow of blood or breaking free and plugging an artery downstream. If blood flow to part of your heart stops, you'll have a heart attack. If blood flow to part of your brain stops, a stroke occurs.Doctors are most concerned about the effect of trans fat on cholesterol. However, trans fat has also been shown to have some other harmful effects:The good news is trans fat is showing up less in food, especially food on grocery store shelves. If you eat out a lot, however, be aware that some restaurants continue to use trans fat. Trans fat is sometimes a part of the oil restaurants use to fry food. A large serving of french fries at some restaurants can contain 5 grams or more of trans fat.How much trans fat you can safely consume is debatable. However, there's no question you should limit trans fat, according to the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association (AHA).No email address was supplied by.

But take heart, these celebrities were also Christmas babies.By Katie Marks,NetworxMany Networx readers will be putting up some form of Christmas tree in the coming days or weeks, and while there arelots of alternativesto the traditional cut conifer, these holiday classics still dominate the landscape. The only problem is what happens at the end of the Christmas season, when that once-proud tree is a brown remainder of its former self, and you have to drag it out of the house, shedding needles along the way, and send it along on the next step to its journey.City streets after Christmas are commonly bedecked with dead Christmas trees waiting mournfully for collection, and some cities actually set up Christmas tree collection programs, specifying a collection day and sending around compost collection trucks to gather up the dead. But that doesn't have to be the fate of your Christmas tree, because there are many creative uses for its remains that offer a more dignified solution.1. Fire starterChristmas trees are infamously flammable, especially at the end of their lives, when they have minimal moisture to suppress flames. Whileelectriciansmay caution you about the use of some electrical components around a Christmas tree, you can use that trait to your advantage when the holidays are over. Cut your tree into manageable portions and use the branches and trunk as kindling and fire starter to quickly get flames going in the woodstove, firepit, or fireplace. Make sure all tinsel and ornaments have been removed to avoid noxious smoke.Be aware that if your tree is at all sappy, you run the risk of creosote buildup. It needs to be completely dry before being used in indoor fireplaces and woodstoves.2. Fire starter, bonus edition: bonfireSome families make an epic post-holiday tradition of creating a bonfire with their trees, and they may even combine forces with friends and other households in the family to make the fire last longer. Christmas trees light up like, well, Christmas trees, and they can make a great bonfire source for a New Year's party on the beach or in the backyard. As with any bonfire, check to determine if you need a burn permit first, and observe safety precautions: light the fire in a clear, open area on a day with minimal wind, don't keep flammable objects nearby, and supervise the tree closely as it burns.3. MulchThose obnoxious shedding needles make fantastic mulch for your garden, and the branches can be composted in the brown layer of your compost. If you have access to a wood chipper, run the trunk and large branches through to create wood chips, which can be used for mulching, lining paths, or suppressing weed growth. Your localLos Angeles landscaping companymay be happy to mulch your tree for a small fee.4. Pathway edgersCut that trunk into miniature rounds and use them in upright position to edge paths (or beds and other garden features). If you have a somewhat folksy, natural, relaxed-feeling garden, they'll fit right in. They'll also break down slowly to nourish the soil and slowly improve the condition of your garden beds, which is a nice added feature. Incidentally, those same rounds can also be sanded and sealed to make coasters.5. Trellising and stakingA trunk with most of the branches trimmed away can create a natural trellis, while leftover branches can be used as a free source of garden stakes. They make be crooked, but that can add to the charn in a garden where more formal straight stakes would look out of place.6. Fish habitatOverwintering fish need places to hide from predators and get out of the coldest parts of the water. That's where tree branches come in. In nature, branches may naturally fall into ponds, rivers, and streams to create habitat, but in more manicured water features, fish typically have fewer options to choose from. Adding branches from old Christmas trees can help keep fish safe through the winter months.7. Make a cat treeAdmit it: your cats have probably already been climbing the Christmas tree, so why not make the arrangement formal? Trim away most of the branches, leaving large and sturdy ones in place as braces for scrap wood from construction sites or the hardware store. Screw the wood down tightly so it won't wobble before you upholster with scrap carpet or other material (consider wrapping some parts of the trunk in coarse rope for the cats to scratch) and set the tree up on a stable base.8. Suet feedersBirds and other animals love suet, especially in the winter months, when food sources are limited. Trim the tree down and drill out the trunk so you can insert suet, bird seed, and other treats. Your old tree will provide you with some great birdwatching!9. Dune restorationHere's a surprising use you might not have heard of: Christmas trees are sometimes anchored in place on beaches to trap sand toslowly rebuild damaged dunes and banks. As the sand builds up, it slowly covers the tree, and conservation organizations can plant dune grasses to hold the sand down. If you're interested in seeing your tree go to a good cause, contact the government agency or conservation group working on beach and dune maintenance in your area to see if they can use your tree.10. RecyclingFinally, yes, you can always recycle your tree. Contact your municipal waste agency to see if they have a citywide tree pickup day, accept curbside trees, or expect people to bring their trees to a recycling lot. Some charities collect trees after Christmas and bring them to a central recycling facility, and you may also be able to drop your tree off at a locale likeHome Depot. Before sending your tree for recycling, please remember to remove ornaments, tinsel, and other decorations that could interfere with processing it.You could also think outside the box: here's a list of40 non-traditional Christmas treesto consider this year!No email address was supplied by.

This latest development has sparked a debate between the Center for Biological Diversity and the Pebble Partnership.Biologists say these freshwater seals are the only population in the United States. They say the seals' unique environment and existence warrant an endangered species label."It's a small population of seals," Center biologist Kiersten Lippmann said. "There are only 250 to 350 individuals in the lake and small variations in their environment can push the population towards extinction."Pebble Partnership CEO John Shively disagrees."We don't think it's necessary," Shively said. "The numbers we have seen with the seals is that they've been pretty stable over time."Shively says the Endangered Species Act improperly."The endangered species act was meant to protect things and bring them back," Shively said. "The act is now being used by the environment movement to stop development."The Center says any mine activity will disrupt the seals and waste coming from the mine will negatively affect the marine mammal's food source."If the species is listed as threatened or endangered the Pebble Mine would have to consult with NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] on what kind of impacts the seal would suffer before moving forward in their permitting process," Lippmann said.But the Pebble Partnership says it already expected to have conversations about the impacts of the mine."We want to build a project that provides local jobs and protects the fish," Shively said. "We've always said that if we can exist with the fish than the fish have to come first. We come second."The Center says last week it passed the first hurdle for the seals to be put on the endangered species list. Now, a 60 day public comment period will go on until the middle of July. Then the federal government will have until next November to make its final decision.Contact Garrett Turner:EmailFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The cause of the decline is unknown, but is thought to be a result of poor spawning or settling success.Diggers are limited to the first 25 clams dug per day and each person may possess up to 25 razor clams. The reduction is effective beginning 12:01 a.m. Thursday, May 23, through December 31.Contact Jessica RidgwayCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Since I live in North Carolina, that means our first stop will be a barbecue pit with either a pork butt (Boston butt to you out-of-staters) or a whole pork shoulder properly rubbed and smoking slowly. In Carolina, it’s all about pork, with pulled pork being the pinnacle of barbecue perfection.Smoking a cheap cut of pork until the gristly connective tissue melts away and the end result is succulent, flavorful meat with a kiss of smoke that’s just waiting for some vinegary, sometimes hot and spicy sauce is an art. In Eastern N.C., you’ll find whole-hog and pork shoulder barbecue most prominent, while Western N.C. ‘cue is more likely to involve the pork butts.Rubs are a critical part of the Carolina barbecue mojo, and you would be more likely to talk Coke out of their secret formula than you would to talk a grizzled barbecue veteran out of his rub recipe. Some recipes have been passed orally from generation to generation, never once written down.I have to take a moment to mention the mustard sauce that’s very popular in South Carolina. You might be taken aback by a yellow barbecue sauce, but there are some fantastic flavors in some of the mustards.Let’s head west a bit to Memphis, where the humid air off the Mississippi makes the smell of smoking ribs hang in the air. If your idea of a good meal involves tearing meat from bone, you’ll find a home here. Ribs are served wet, where they are basted with sauce before, during and after cooking, or dry, where a rib rub is applied liberally and often allowed to sit on the ribs for several hours before smoking.Each school has its adherents, and you would do well to sample liberally from both schools. The classic Memphis barbecue sauce is tomato-based, with a spicy-sweet hit that will vary widely depending on the restaurant.You’ll even find some places that don’t smoke their ribs at all, preferring to use a commercial oven and let the rub and/or sauce do the talking. ‘Cue purists by and large avoid such modern innovations.That said, you can make some of the best ribs you have ever tasted at home using the same method. The folks at Williamson House make aRib Kitthat contains everything you need to make insanely good baby back ribs in your oven. I haven’t smoked a single rack of ribs since I started using their method. There’s even a video on the website that takes you step by step through the process.Farther west we come to Kansas City, home of the American Royal Barbecue and home base of one of the largest barbecue judging federations in the country. Kansas City was once the king of the stockyards, and that heritage continues in the barbecue, which embraces pretty much every sort of beast slow and stupid enough to let humans catch and eat it. A great example is Jack Stack’s Barbecue, where you can find beef, pork, sausage, chicken, lamb and turkey in various preparations. While some from other regions argue that the proliferation of meats leads to a lack of focus and thus a lower overall quality, the continued popularity of KC ‘cue would seem to give the lie to that. Nowhere does the carnivore flag fly more proudly than in Kansas City’s hallowed barbecue halls.While rub and smoke are both important to Kansas City barbecue, the real secret is the sauce. The classic KC sauce is fairly sweet, with a tomato/molasses base, and quite thick. You will need extra napkins, Wet-Naps and quite possibly a garden hose to clean yourself up after a proper KC barbecue feast.And now, finally, we head south, to my adopted home state of Texas, where beef brisket is king and sauce is usually very much optional.The most recognized and imitated form of Texas barbecue is the Central Texas style practiced in Austin as well as in the Texas ‘cue capitals of Luling, Taylor and Lockhart. In this style, a properly rubbed (and occasionally marinated) whole beef brisket is smoked with tremendous slowness using smoke from pecan or oak wood. Many people suffer from the erroneous belief that mesquite is used in the process, but mesquite imparts a distinctively bitter flavor that can just flat ruin a brisket when cooking “low and slow.”If you want a spice blend that will get you well on your way to a spicy Texas rub, the folks atDeYoung's Fore Seasonshave a new Chipotle Blend that has an amazing spicy, smoky but not overpoweringly hot kick. It's outstanding on beef and can really wake up roasted chicken if you get some up under the skin and let it work its magic on the meat. Their original recipe is good on ... well ... everything. My favorite ways to use it are on oven-roasted red potatoes and grilled salmon, and it's also an ingredient in my pork rub.If you go into a barbecue restaurant in Luling, expect to be sold beef and probably sausage, with a stack of white bread slices and sides such as beans, pickles and jalapenos. You would do well not to ask for sauce, as it is a matter of pride among many barbecue chefs that their meat speaks for itself.If you do find a sauce offered, it will almost always be on the side. Personally, I won’t eat at a Texas place that sauces the meat before it’s handed to me. They’re hiding something. The sauce itself is actually a fairly complex and tasty affair with tomato, brown sugar, vinegar and a whole host of herbs and spices along for the ride.Hungry yet?Got a question? Comment?

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was involved in finding a new place for the young cub.“Now, as Kali leaves Alaska for his next short-term home, we are confident that the Buffalo Zoo will provide the best of care for Kali as the Service makes a final determination on a permanent home for the cub,” Dan Ashe, FWS Director, said.The arrival of Kali will help the Buffalo Zoo move forward with its plans for a new world-class polar bear exhibit.  The Buffalo Zoo is already home to Luna, a six-month old polar bear cub, who will be a constant companion for Kali.“It’s sad to see him go because it has been great seeing him triple in size, develop physically, and become socialized to people,” Patrick Lampi, the Executive Director at the Alaska Zoo, said. “It’s good to know that he is going to a good place and that he is going to have a companion 24/7, that’s really important for the psychological well-being of a cub.”Dr. Donna Fernandes, the president of the Buffalo Zoo, echos Lampi's statement and says both cubs will benefit from the opportunity to play with each other and be role-models for bear-like behavior, as well as not becoming too attached to their human caretakers."We are thrilled to receive Kali," Dr. Fernandes said. "Recovery of orphaned cubs is one of the reasons we are building our new polar bear habitat, Arctic Edge."UPS will transport Kali, along with Executive Director Lampi, Zoo Curator Shannon Jensen, and Dr. Kurt Volle, a veterinarian with the Buffalo Zoo.  The journey will take about fourteen hours, with a brief stop in Louisville, Kentucky and Dr. Volle will check on the cub throughout the flightUPS says that Kali’s crate “will be the last item loaded on the plane and the first item unloaded.”In March, the FWS received a report that a female polar bear had been taken near the Alaskan community of Point Lay and the cub was transferred to the North Slope Borough’s Department of Wildlife Management in Barrow.Alaska Airlines flew Kali to Anchorage after examination in Barrow. The Alaska Zoo worked cooperatively with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to temporarily care for Kali and help make arrangements for his move. M&T Bank arranged and funded Kali’s trip to Buffalo."Unfortunately, we would love to have him stay out in the wild but you know he just wouldn't survive being an orphan," Lampi said. "The next best thing is us being good stewards taking care of him, letting him live an enriched life, and being an ambassador for his species."Contact Sarah EvansCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"Adding just one food to another can make a tremendous difference in your total nutrient intake and offer significant health gains," says Tara Gidus, RD, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Here are quick pairings that taste great, take seconds to make, and add up to amazingheart health.Whole grain cereal (any kind) + sunflower seedsSprinkling 3 tablespoons ofsunflowerseeds into your morning cereal provides more than 100 percent of your day's requirements for alpha-tocopherol, the most active form ofvitamin E. As anantioxidant, vitamin E protects cells from damage caused by destructive free radicals that can lead to cardiovascular disease.Garden salad + canned wild salmonAdding 3 ounces of canned wildsalmonto your salad provides half of the weekly recommendation for healthyomega-3fats. The fatty acids found in canned salmon are linked with improvements in heart and brain health. Choosing wild lowers your exposure to dioxin, a cancer-causing contaminant found in the feed given to the farm-raised variety.Seltzer + grape juiceGrapejuice contains a phytochemical called resveratrol found in the skin of red and purple grapes. Research linksresveratrolto lower blood pressure, reducedLDL cholesterol, and fewer blood clots.Soup (any kind) + pinto beansAdding 1/2 cup of beans to soup lowers both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol -- the unhealthy kind that contributes to the buildup of arterial plaque -- according to researchers at Arizona State University Polytechnic. They found that people who ate 1/2 cup of pinto beans a day lowered both their total and LDL cholesterol by about 8 percent. (Beans are high infiber, which decreases levels of LDL by reducing its absorption.) One-half cup of black,kidney, or pinto beans supplies about one-third of your day's fiber needs. The heat from soup cooks canned beans through, and they add heft to a lighter broth.Sometimes it's one simple swap that can yield the biggest benefits.For more healthy living news and features, visit PureMatters.com -- and don't forget to stop by the Pure Matters Shop for all your vitamin and supplement needs.Source: Pure Matters http://www.purematters.com/prevention/heart-disease/heart-smart-choices-that-add-upDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Here's how your daily diet can make a big difference in your brain health and Alzheimer's risk.<COL>iStock / ImageegamIFromPureMatters.comMisplacing your keys. Forgetting someone's name. We've all had occasional episodes of forgetfulness. ButAlzheimer's diseaseis something more than normal age-relatedmemoryloss. Alzheimer's symptoms extend far beyond a few misplaced memories, eventually affecting personality, behavior, and ultimately your ability to live on your own.Experts say that an Alzheimer's disease vaccine is in the early testing phase, but until it's perfected, there are natural measures you can take to boost your brain health: exercising regularly, staying socially active, engaging in hobbies that challenge your mind, avoidingtobaccoproducts, and giving your brain thenutrientsit needs to function in top form. Here's where to focus on diet changes for the biggest payoff.Get the anti-Alzheimer's power of omega 3s.Omega-3fatty acids such asDHA and EPA(docosahexaeneoic acid andeicosapentaenoic acid) may help protect your brain from Alzheimer's. DHA is the main type of omega-3 in the brain; it's found in the membranes around nerve cells, especially where they connect to each other. Try to eat cold-water fish (such as halibut, mackerel, salmon, trout, and tuna) two or three times a week, and/or take a daily omega-3 supplement. Also try to lower your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, which are associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.Boost your brain health with berries.Antioxidantsin general appear to be good for your brain, so try to eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables each day. (Different hues of veggies provide different nutrients.) Antioxidants work by deactivating free radicals (naturally occurring compounds that can damage healthy cells). Berries in particular -- especiallyblueberries,strawberries, andcranberries-- have been found to boost brain function in studies of animals with and without Alzheimer's-like symptoms.Fight memory loss with folic acid.If you're not taking in enough folic acid each day, you may be unwittingly raising your risk of Alzheimer's. The recommended daily dose offolic acidfor most adults is 400 micrograms (mcg). (Women should take more duringpregnancyand breast-feeding.) Some studies have shown that diets rich in leafy greens (such asromaineorspinach) and crucifers (such asbroccoli) may help protect brain function, too.

And while healthier diets provide an obvious antidote to their fattier counterparts, there is an obvious reason Americans tend to choose foods in the latter category -- they taste awesome.So, if the challenge is to marry great taste with healthier intake, and the nation's well-being hinges on the result, health mavens couldn't do much better than to look toward today's more innovative restaurant chains.For example, recently chosen for the top spot on "Health" magazine's America's Healthiest Chain Restaurants list, UNO has found a way to offer a menu filled with healthy choices, and to have its customers embrace these choices enthusiastically."We start by rejecting the notion that healthy food must sacrifice taste," said Frank Guidara, CEO of UNO Chicago Grill. "That simply isn't true. Granted, to achieve both, you will require the highest level of culinary talent. But we have plenty of that at UNO, and that's why we knew we could create menu offerings that would be both healthy and delicious."A chef of great talent knows that for every unhealthy item added to enhance taste, a healthy alternative can be found or concocted. At UNO, that means diners can enjoy a roasted eggplant, spinach and feta flatbread pizza on multigrain crust without guilt or worry, since it has only 280 calories and six grams of fiber per serving. Diners can choose the multigrain crust option for any flatbread pizza. Another great option for a delicious entree is the lemon basil salmon, which has just 240 calories per serving.And when it comes to carbohydrates, UNO teamed with Barilla to offer whole grain penne as an option to any pasta -- helping to add more fiber and whole grains to your diet without sacrificing taste.Just as important as healthy choices is good, easy-to-access information. That's why UNO offers nutrition information through its Web site and on display in restaurant lobby kiosks, with categories that show diners which items are under 500 calories, which are vegetarian and which are created to serve those with food allergies. What's more, UNO's site offers tips for eating healthy in restaurants, including ways to lessen fat content and caloric intake without sacrificing flavor.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Find out ways to wash your car that won't hurt the environment.<COL>istockBy Katie Marks,NetworxThis time of year, my car gets absolutely filthy. Every once in a while I'll use the squeegee at the gas station to get rid of the worst of the buildup on my windows, but I've long left the body of my car dirty because I assumed it wasn't possible to wash my car in a way that would be ecologically friendly.For me, the thought of wasting gallons of water on an aesthetic exercise just seems silly, even though I know buildups of grime aren't great for my paint job. After enough friends mocked me about the state of my car, though, I decided that maybe it was time to do some research and see if it was possible to have my cake (clean car) and eat it too (clean AND green car).Here's what I found out.For one thing, my first instinct was right: the hose job at my place is not the way to go -- and that's even with a hose that I can turn on and off at the sprayer. Garden hoses pump out around seven gallons of water a minute, and that's a heck of a lot of water, most of which turns into runoff when you're washing a car on, say, thatconcretedriveway. That runoff can end up in the water table, or take the path of least resistance right into a creek or river, where it can cause problems for fish, plants, and other critters.I could reduce the amount of runoff by tightly controlling the water I use and washing my car on grass or gravel for natural filtration, saysAsk Umbra at Grist, but I'd still need to think about the soaps I'm using. Harsh industrial cleaners are not the way to go; environmentally-friendly biodegradeable soaps are strongly recommended so they can break down quickly in the environment. As for window cleaners, vinegar and old newspapers works a treat -- and doesn't leave unpleasant chemical traces behind.Better yet, and this one surprised me,I could go to a car wash. Car washes use water more efficiently with their high pressure hoses and timers. Furthermore, they collect and either recycle or treat their water before releasing it, because they're required to do so and have hadplumbers install greywater recycling systems. Instead of just running off into the wild blue wonder, that filthy water is safely managed when I go to the carwash...plus, they have those awesome giant vacuum cleaners.There's another option, though, and that's waterless car washes.What?!Yes!Round up some soft, absorbent rags to wipe down your car, with a little touch ofyour favorite eco-friendly homemade cleaner. Choose an all-purpose cleaner without abrasives, and while you'll need to use a little elbow grease, you will be able to lift that dirt away. There are also some commercial water-free carwash products available.For stubborn stains and caked-on dirt, you may have to use some advanced cleaning tricks. Try applying cleaning spray and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes before scrubbing it away, and our old friend peanut butter can be great for really stubborn buildups of sap, gum, and mystery substances. While you're at it, you can refresh the inside of your car with a mixture of lemon and olive oil where you'd normally use Armor All -- and if you have mysterious odors trapped in the upholstery, try vacuuming, sprinkling with baking soda, letting it sit for half an hour, and then vacuuming again.Whether you hit the car wash or go waterless, apparently you can clean your car and still feel good about yourself in the morning!Source:http://www.networx.com/article/car-washing-the-eco-friendly-wayNo email address was supplied by.

The service's draft assessment calls for a potential removal of about 2,200 animals before it has to impose limitations.

He says, “I hope to find out, find out what they were doing.”The survey has several languages, including English, Russian, and Japanese. The address on the note reads 2725 Montlake BLVD Seattle, WA.“I did a Google search and that address is no longer valid,” said Makar. “NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] is there, and NOAA began their service in I believe 1970, so this was probably before that.”Makar and his friend traveled in a Cessna 180 and stopped at a few places, looking for glass balls and floats and different things. They found the bottle on a beach about 20 miles out of Cold Bay towards Port Heiden.As for what will happen to the future of the message of the bottle, Makar says “I think I'll probably frame it and put it on my wall.”“Yeah, pass it on to my children, it's kind of a unique item.”Click here to a view a photo gallery of the message in the bottle.Contact Sarah Evans(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Peters says it’s possible to be charged with wanton waste even in a case where a shooting was properly reported and officials determined it to be justified.“As a person killing an animal, you have an obligation to salvage all edible meat -- if you don’t, that’s wanton waste,” Peters said.Baldwin was charged with four offenses: wanton waste of game meat, taking a moose during a closed season, unlawful possession of game and hunting without a valid license.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such asheart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating morefiberand lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number youburnoff in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such asdepression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems withpregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, andinfluenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to theageof 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.For people older than 60, the vaccine Zostavax was licensed by the FDA in 2006 to prevent shingles. Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chicken pox. After an attack of chicken pox, the virus lies dormant in certain nerve tissue. As people age, it is possible for the virus to reappear in the form of shingles, which is estimated to affect two in every 10 people in their lifetime. Shingles is characterized by clusters of blisters, which develop on one side of the body. The blisters can cause severepainthat may last for weeks, months or years after the virus reappears. Studies showed that the vaccine reduced the occurrence of shingles between 50 and 64 percent.No email address was supplied by.

Keith Mallard moved on to acting commissioner of the Department of Public Safety following Joe Masters stepping down.Earlier in January, Governor Sean Parnell appointed Col. Gary Folger to the job of Department of Public Safety commissioner, officially succeeding Joe Masters.According to a statement issued the State Troopers, Cockrell started his career with DPS in 1983 as a Fish and Wildlife Protection Officer, retiring as a major for the Alaska State Troopers in 2004. He quickly returned to work with the Troopers to coordinate a Joint Enforcement Agreement with federal partners before retiring again in 2007.Cockrell returned to DPS on June 3, 2013, when he was appointed director of the Division of Alaska Wildlife Troopers. His appointment as director of DPS is effective immediately.Trooper spokesperson Beth Ipsen said Thursday that Mallard is "no longer with the Department of Public Safety.""The director’s position is an appointed position and subject to serve at the will of the commissioner," Ispen wrote. "Commissioner Folger decided to go in a different direction and choose not to retain Keith Mallard in the director’s position."Ipsen said Mallard could be re-hired as a trooper, as well as apply for commissioner positions if the future.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

You should try to get them from food, but if you think you're falling short, ask your health care provider aboutsupplements.The name symbolizes strength. Still, up to three out of four adolescent girls and women of childbearingagedon't get enough of this vital mineral, according to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention. Causes ofirondeficiency include menstrual bleeding and iron-poor diets.Iron is essential to building red blood cells that transport oxygen through your body. It's also important to yourimmune systemand mental faculties.The amount of iron you need varies widely by age, gender, and circumstances. Your body absorbs iron from beef, chicken, and fish more easily than iron from egg yolk, cereal, dried beans, peas, and dark green leafy vegetables.Thisantioxidantmineral works withvitaminsA, C, and E, as well as with the mineralzinc, to protect cells from damage.Seleniummay help us avoid prostate, colon, and lungcancer, according to studies at Harvard University, the University of Arizona, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Meats, seafood, grains, and seeds contain selenium, but the amount in foods varies based on where the food was grown. Selenium occurs naturally in soil and different types of soil contain varying amounts of selenium. As a result, foods grown in high selenium soil will contain more selenium naturally.You need 55 mcg per day, but don't overdo: More than 400 mcg daily can cause skininflammation, convulsions, and other problems.To get enoughvitamin D, head outdoors: Yourlivermakes this vitamin after yourskinabsorbs sunlight. With the exception offish oilsand some fatty fish, food offers little natural vitamin D. It's added to milk. Vitamin D helps your body absorb and metabolizecalcium, strengtheningbones. So getting enough Vitamin D is just as important as getting sufficient amounts of calcium.A sunscreen of 30 SPF or greater appears to block vitamin D production, she adds. Sunscreen users can absorb vitamin D from milk -- but if you don't drink milk, don't forsake your sunscreen. Ask your doctor what's right for you.Heed the intake suggestions below. More than 2,000 IU daily can be toxic.Vitamin Khelps make your blood clot and works with calcium and vitamin D to build strong bones.Normal bacteria in your digestive system help make vitamin K. To ensure you consume enough vitamin K, eat those green vegetables. Your body also can make vitamin K from eggs, milk, and meat.Vitamin K can interfere with blood-thinning medications Talk with your doctor if you're on such medication or you're not sure.Zinc’s functions in the body are many and diverse. It is involved in the action of many enzymes. Specific functions in humans are difficult to pinpoint but people who don't get enough zinc are at higher risk for growth failure, dermatitis, birth defects, decreased sperm production, and changes in the immune system.Zinc has been popular as a supplement, but claims that it shortens colds appear to be unfounded.You can find zinc in many foods, including red meat,wheatbran,almonds,peanutbutter, and tuna. Vegetarians need more zinc than people who eat animal products.Suggested daily intakes of these five vitamins and minerals:Vitamin D:Men and women, age 50 and younger, 200 IU; ages 51 to 70, 400 IU; ages 71 and older, 600 IU; upper limit, 2,000 IUSource:http://resources.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/dont-miss-out-on-these-5-nutrientsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"He gets up, goes out, comes in, has his food and then goes back to sleep."Creme Puff, the oldest cat ever, lived with her owner in Texas until dying in 2005 at age 38, according to Guinness World Records.No email address was supplied by.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such asheart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating morefiberand lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number youburnoff in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Weight in Pounds(Height in inches) x (Height in inches)Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such asdepression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems withpregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, andinfluenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to theageof 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.No email address was supplied by.

"He certainly had a big belly when he was caught."Police later detonated the bomb in a controlled explosion, according to The Telegraph.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Check out these basketball movies.<COL>Can't get enough basketball? Or maybe you're looking for a break from the intense action on the court with a little bit of scripted Hollywood drama.Check out some of these top basketball-themed movies, from a 1970s comedy to an Oscar-nominated documentary to real-life tales about Ken Carter and Don Haskins."One on One" (1977)Small-town high school basketball star Henry Steele struggles when he moves to a university in a big city on a basketball scholarship. Steele becomes overwhelmed by his duties to the team and struggles academically because he never fully learned to read. His situation improves when he is assigned a pretty graduate student as his tutor."The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh" (1979)This 1979 film features the Pittsburgh Pythons, the NBA's worst team. The players blame the poor play on the team's star, Moses Guthrie, and walk out, leaving the squad to resort to astrology to fill out its roster. The team selects new players through open tryouts, with the requirement that all team members must be Pisces, the same Zodiac sign as Guthrie. The film features NBA legends Julius Erving and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."Hoosiers" (1986)Regarded as one of the best sports movies of all time, "Hoosiers" is based on a true story about a small-town high school basketball team that makes the state finals. Gene Hackman stars as coach Norman Dale, a coach with a checkered past who molds his team into contenders. The film also features Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper."White Men Can't Jump" (1992)Billy Hoyle, played by Woody Harrelson, and Sidney Deane, played by Wesley Snipes, are basketball players who are good at hustling on their own, but when they join forces they find even more success. Hoyle needs to win to pay off gambling debts and Deane wants to earn more money to move his family to a better neighborhood. Rosie Perez also stars in the film."Hoop Dreams" (1994)This 1994 documentary, which was nominated for an Academy Award, follows two young inner-city Chicago basketball players -- Arthur Agee and William Gates -- through their high school careers. The movie chronicles the successes and tragedies that Agee and Gates endured throughout their quest to become basketball stars."The Air Up There" (1994)Assistant basketball coach Jimmy Dolan, played by Kevin Bacon, needs to land a top recruit to get promoted to head coach. To find his big star, Dolan travels deep into Africa to woo Saleh into moving to the U.S. to play on Dolan's team. But Saleh, who is the chief's son and therefore has duties within his tribe, is reluctant to leave."Blue Chips" (1994)College basketball coach Pete Bell, played by Nick Nolte, is pressured to attract big-name players to his school to build a winning program. But Bell faces a dilemma when his top recruits expect compensation for committing to his team, which is an NCAA violation. Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway also star in the film."Love and Basketball" (2000)From young next-door neighbors to high school classmates, Monica and Quincy enjoyed a friendship that involved a common goal of making it to the NBA. The two become a couple when they are both playing basketball at USC, but within a year they break up before being reunited again years later."Coach Carter" (2005)Based on a true story, "Coach Carter" chronicles Ken Carter's quest to transform the boys' basketball team at his old high school in a poor area of Richmond, Calif. Carter, who is also the owner of a sporting goods store, makes his team sign contracts that include promises for respectful behavior, a dress code and good grades as a must in order to participate on the team. After initial resistance, the players take to Carter's rules and success on the court soon follows. But when the players begin to slack off in school, Carter follows through on his promise to not let them play, and locks the gym until the players' grades improve. The move draws debate from the team, school and community."Glory Road" (2006)Based on a true story, "Glory Road" details the story of Texas Western basketball coach Don Haskins who recruited the best available talent in the country, black or white, to make up his 1965-66 squad. During a time when racism was high in the U.S., the team endures criticism and prejudices throughout the season, but puts all of it aside and comes together to win on the court. The team advances to the NCAA championship against powerhouse Kentucky, where Haskins makes history by starting the first all-black lineup.Copyright Internet Broadcasting.

She said without a mother, young cougars lack the skills and resources they need to survive on their own in the wild.Right now, there's no timeline for when the Oregon cougar cubs might be able to make their next journey across the country. They are currently being kept in the zoo's veterinary hospital.The Baker City Herald reported the hunter was given a warning, but not a citation for killing the mother cougar. Authorities deemed it an inadvertent mistake that would have been very difficult to avoid. The cubs were so young, they had never left their den, meaning there was no miniature paw prints in the snow.No email address was supplied by.

Here's how to eat to stay in the game.<COL>iStock / IlzaIlzaFromPureMatters.comThe best way to fightsports injuriesis to avoid them entirely. And amazingly, something as simple as what you put in your mouth can help. Here's how to stock your fridge and kitchen cabinets so you won't need to overwork the medicine cabinet.Just add water.Seventy-five percent of muscle mass is made up offluid. If you don't drink enough, your risk of strains, sprains, and pulled muscles escalates.Change your oil.Omega-3 fatty acids fightinflammationjust like aspirin does. (And the sources—walnuts, salmon—taste better, too.) That means lesspain, more gains.Bet on green.Leafy green vegetables and citrus fruit boost the blood's alkaline levels, which helps heal wounds faster, says Gay Riley, MS, RD, CCN, author of The Pocket Personal Trainer. They'll also make your blood less acidic, which cuts inflammation.Give yourself a C."Collagen is abundant in connective tissues, tendons,bones, and muscles," says Riley.Vitamin Cis a key component of your body's collagen recipe.Give yourself another C: calcium.A study from Brigham and Women's Hospital found that injured athletes typically consumed 25 to 40 percent lesscalciumthan their uninjured counterparts.Do it your whey.Glutathione, an antioxidant, protects your body in many ways, says Riley, and whey powder helps you make more of it. Whey is also the most readily absorbed source of branched-chain amino acids—microscopic muscle-repair kits.Go for glucosamine.Okay, so glucosamine sulfate may not be a standard on your grocery list. But it's a powerful supplement when it comes to injury protection. Think of it as adding cement to a creaky foundation. Glucosamine creates polymers called glucosaminal glycans (GAGs) that build and strengthen the tissues, preventing tears. Try pairing it with chondroitin, which promotes GAG formation and inhibits degradation enzymes in connective tissue.Make friends with SAM-e.Methylation -- a chemical process that helps your body build connective tissue—is important in muscle recovery, inflammation control, and muscle support and stability. If you take NSAIDs (such as aspirin and ibuprofen), all they do is block post-workout inflammation. Pop SAM-e instead; it fuels methylation to provide benefits beyond the effect of NSAIDs.Chug a cola (or an antioxidant-packed iced tea).In a University of Georgia study, cyclists who downed 10 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight before a 30-minute ride had significantly less thigh pain than those who took a placebo.

We slather on the sunscreen, wear hats and don UV-protective clothing. Meanwhile, our teeth and bones pay the price -- staying out of the sun means we don't activate production of our sunshine vitamin, vitamin D, which is critical to strong bones and pearly whites.In addition to our obsession with UV protection, numerous studies point to the fact that the Dietary Reference Intakes (RDIs) for vitamin D set in the 1990s are no longer sufficient based on new research that shows vitamin D wears more than a "calcium absorption" hat. It turns out that vitamin D could be a strong defensive player against cancer, heart disease, immunity and neuromuscular disorders. Based on this, you can bet that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has set determining the optimal intake of vitamin D as a high priority.Most Americans face a serious vitamin D deficiency, with women having the greatest risk of deficiency. Nearly half of us don't meet our recommended daily intake for vitamin D, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Dietetic Association.A lack of vitamin D in our diets has put us on a path toward some serious health problems. Studies show that a lack of vitamin D may put people at risk for diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis.Geography, age, skin color and the amount of SPF we apply plays a serious role in how much or how little vitamin D our bodies produce. Today, most vitamin D comes from the foods we eat. Fish is one of the few foods naturally rich in vitamin D. Tuna, salmon, sardines and mackerel are especially excellent sources of vitamin D, but it's unlikely that we're eating enough to make up for our vitamin D deficit. Products such as milk and yogurt, certain baked goods and oil spreads usually pack extra vitamin D, too.So, how much should be we be getting? Well, we won't know for sure until the IOM sets new recommendations. You can visit your doctor and request a blood test for the active form of vitamin D, known as 25 hydroxy D3. The amount of vitamin D needed to maintain optimal levels in our blood has not yet been established, but initial studies suggest the range to be a concentration somewhere between 40 and 80 nanomoles/liter. This test can be taken at your annual check-up to see how effective your diet is in providing you with vitamin D.In the meantime, eat the foods I've mentioned as being high in vitamin D. You can also supplement 200 IUs per day (if you're under 50 years of age) or 400 IUs a day (if you're over 50 years of age). Eating a LUNA bar is another great way to get vitamin D, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium and folic acid, that women need.

Seafood -- like shrimp, tilapia, and salmon -- is brimming with nutrients. What really sets seafood apart from other healthy foods is that it's a natural source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids."Fish has become a go-to food for a real health boost," says Aviva Goldfarb, author and founder of "The Six O'Clock Scramble," an online weekly menu planner and cookbook. "It's a lean protein and a great way to get a dose of omega-3. Since our bodies cannot make omega-3, it's important to regularly include them in our diets."Studies show that a diet containing omega-3s may decrease the risk of certain cancers, decrease blood pressure, reduce Alzheimer's symptoms, improve arthritis and joint pain, and promote heart health."A lot of people are intimidated when it comes to preparing fish, but by keeping the ingredients simple and flavorful, you can prepare a healthy, delicious dish in minutes," says Goldfarb.Experts, including the American Heart Association, recommend consuming at least two servings of seafood a week.

Growing bodies need carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals to develop correctly. However, many American children do not take in the proper requirements.When a child sees there is a choice between a convenient sugary donut versus a bowl of whole grain oatmeal, which one would they choose? In reality, it is more convenient to hand over the donut than to make the bowl of oatmeal.So, how can parents ensure that their children receive the nutrients they need? A healthy, balanced diet proves the best defense against malnourishment, but multivitamins can help provide missing nutrients and minerals. Here are some common nutrients that children sometimes struggle to receive in their diets:- Omega 3 Fatty Acids. Scientists link Omega 3 fatty acids to healthy brain development, but unless children love fatty fish -- salmon proves a good source -- they might not receive enough. Parents can ask their pediatricians about fish oil capsules, but Americans concerned about heavy metals in fish should consider flax seeds as an alternative. Flax seed oil can be put in smoothies while whole or ground and makes a tasty addition to baked goods.- Vitamin D. If a child hates outdoor activities, he could become deficient in vitamin D, a nutrient essential to bone growth. The human body naturally makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, but modern lifestyles are keeping children indoors. Most milk, soy milks and orange juices receive vitamin D fortification to fill this gap, but picky eaters might refuse to drink their D.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a multivitamin containing 200 IU (international units) of vitamin D for children who stay indoors, do not drink 17 ounces of vitamin D-enhanced liquid every day, and who eat a vegetarian diet.One supplement, the Children's Chewable 100 percent All-Natural Multi Vitamin from Kidz-Med (www.kidzmed.com), fulfills children's vitamin D needs without containing preservatives or unnatural sugars. The chewable vitamins taste like fruit, so they appeal to young tongues.- Calcium. Children who eat diary products probably get enough calcium from their diet, but if a child prefers soda or juice to milk or calcium-fortified soy milk, they might require supplementation. Children ages one to three need 500 mg of calcium every day, and their daily requirements only increase as they age.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

However, family obligations keep you so busy that dinner often means fast food or take-out.Fortunately, there is a happy medium between healthfulness and convenience. With a well-stocked pantry, it's easy and less expensive to create healthy meals in minutes without extra trips to the grocery store.Elizabeth Ward, a registered dietitian and nutrition book author, provides these tips for creating the perfect pantry:* Keep supplies for healthy last-minute meals on hand. Pantry staples like whole-wheat pasta, eggs, tomato sauce, canned tuna fish, peanut butter, canned salmon and canned beans (such as black beans and garbanzos) can make quick and healthy sandwiches, soups, omelets and more.* Stock up on natural foods. Many common pantry supplies, like canned soups, crackers and sugary cereals, contain large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats and sodium. Choose more nutritious alternatives.* Choose whole grains. Oatmeal, whole wheat bread and brown rice are healthy staples, but you can also create quick, easy meals and side dishes from grains like bulgur wheat, buckwheat, quinoa and whole wheat couscous. Snack on popcorn (a whole grain) instead of fatty chips, and make a delicious trail mix with whole grain cereal, dried fruit and nuts.* Spice it up. With a well-stocked spice rack, you can prepare simple dishes such as beans and rice with an Indian, Mexican or Mediterranean flare. Stock dried rosemary, thyme, tarragon, dill, cumin, cinnamon, sage, chili powder, turmeric, bay leaves, curry powder, garlic powder, onion powder and black and red pepper.

Kinmon, Sr., 62, as well at assistant guide Colin S. Marquiss, 23, and a former client, , Joseph C. Hahn, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Kinmon, owner of Alaska Trophy Hunters in Wasilla, was a licensed Alaska Department of Fish & Game vendor for five years dating back to 2008. Charges stemming from an Alaska Wildlife Troopers investigation allege he sold big game tags to four clients after they had already harvested their animals. Attorneys say Kinmon also acted as a guide for caribou without being certified, assisted a client in taking an illegal moose, and falsified public records.Prosecutors say Kinmon also baited a grizzly bear with a moose carcass that he moved from the kill site with an Argo all-terrain vehicle. Troopers have seized two such Argos as part of their investigation.Kinmon is charged with a total of 30 violations of state game and guiding laws from between 2009 and 2011.Marquiss is charged with three counts of unlawfully guiding and hunting a big game animal with clients. Hahn is charged with four counts of taking a brown/grizzly bear without a valid non-resident tag, unlawful possession of game and falsifying public records.Several charges carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail and up to a $10,000 fine. Some of the guiding charges carry maximum penalties up to one year in jail and a $30,000 fine.In August of 2013, Kinmon was also arraigned in Delta Junction on six other guiding counts. In that case, prosecutors say one of Kinmon’s other clients allegedly harvested a grizzly bear in September 2008 without a valid non-resident tag.Troopers say the investigation began when the Anchorage Wildlife Investigations Unit received a complaint in July 2012 from a former client of Kinmon who claimed that another client on a guided hunt had killed a Dall sheep without possessing a valid non-resident tag.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Commercial operations are allotted 81.7 percent of the biomass; the charter fleet gets the remaining 18.3 percent. The allotments are part of the recently-agreed upon Catch Sharing Plan.Excluded from the equation are unguided recreational fisherman, whose limits are two fish a day of any size.Last year Southeast Alaska’s halibut charters had an allocation of 788,000 pounds, and were allowed to keep fish under 44 inches or larger than 68.“We actually think we will come in reasonably under the 760,000 limit," said Heath Hilyard, the executive director of Southeast Alaska Guides Organization.Hilyard said tighter limits not only reduce the amount of fish charter fishermen can take, but could push more people toward unguided recreational fishing, which has fewer restrictions and allows for more fish to be taken per day.But allowing fishermen to keep any halibut longer than 76 inches could also help lure customers looking for trophies, Hilyard said.“Odds are they aren’t going to catch them, but they have the option of catching a world-class fish.”Ultimately Hilyard said the commission’s “conservative” decision is “in the interests of the long-term health of the resource.”“We had hoped there might a modest upward adjustment over the blue line sufficient to help us return to the lower slot of 45 inches,” he said. “Ultimately, the most important thing is the health and future of the resource,” Hilyard said.The commission's allocation for Southcentral charter fishermen was reduced to 1.78 million pounds, with new limits adopted allowing a two fish bag. A further restriction states that the second fish cannot be longer than 29 inches.Charter vessels are also limited to one trip per day.The measures were recommended by a halibut charter management committee to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which went on to be adopted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission.A full list of the International Pacific Halibut Commission's catch limits for all regions in Alaska can be foundon their website.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Find out what you should be consuming each day.<COL>iStock / gvictoria(NewsUSA) - Although consumers say they are at least somewhat knowledgeable about nutrition, new research from the International Food Information Council (IFIC) shows several wide gaps between American's perception of their nutrient intakes and reality.."While there is some disparity between perceived nutrient adequacy and actual nutrient intake, it is notable that consumers recognize the benefits their food can offer," says Sarah Romotsky, registered dietitian and associate director of health and wellness at the IFIC Foundation. "Indeed, health-promoting foods and food components, like blueberries, yogurt, fish, milk and fortified breads and breakfast cereals, play an important role in meetingnutrient needsand improving overall health."According to the 2013 IFIC Functional Foods Consumer survey, however, the majority of respondents (almost 70 percent) believe they fall short of meeting "all or nearly all" of their nutritional needs.What's more, a comparison of the survey's findings and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data shows gaps between how many believe their intakes are adequate versus recommended daily intakes or nutrient intake recommendations (Dietary Reference Intakes from the Institute of Medicine). For nutrients such as vitamin D (68 percent perception vs. 32 percent consumption), potassium (61 percent vs. less than 3 percent) and fiber (67 percent vs. 5 percent), the discrepancy between perception and reality is glaring.The high percentage of consumers who are meeting their needs for B vitamins may be a testament to how fortification can help consumers meet their nutrient needs."Breads, rice and cereals, which are often fortified with B Vitamins, may be helping consumers meet their B vitamin needs, without the consumer realizing the added value," says Romotsky.However, there are still gaps in knowledge and consumption of a variety of other beneficial components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, flavonoids and zeaxanthin.The good news, though, according to the survey, is that consumer interest in learning more about foods with benefits beyond basic nutrition remains high. Almost nine in 10 Americans say they are interested in learning more about foods that have health benefits beyond basic nutrition, but cited barriers such as price.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The man received minor injuries that did not require medical attention.”AST spokesperson Megan Peters says the bitten man was a crew member of the F/V Confidence, which was offloading bait herring at the time.“He received several large scratch marks on his buttocks as a result of the sea lion jumping from the water and biting him,” Peters wrote. “Thankfully he was wearing rain gear or it would likely have been worse.”While Peters says troopers don’t believe that the crew of the Confidence was feeding sea lions, feedings by others likely played a factor in the attack.“We believe this attack occurred as a result of the sea lion being habituated to humans and associating them with food,” Peters wrote. “This is the result of people either feeding sea lions, or improperly disposing of fish waste.”Julie Speegle, a spokesperson with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in Alaska, says the crewman is fishing Monday and officials haven’t yet had a chance to take a statement from him.“He was basically just offloading fish,” Speegle said. “There were no puncture wounds -- it was just abrasions.”According to Speegle, while previous attacks by sea lions have taken place, there’s no indication that a single sea lion has been repeatedly targeting humans. She asks that people both inform authorities of attacks and take steps to avoid their recurrence.“It happens occasionally, and we certainly encourage people to report incidents,” Speegle said. “Definitely exercise caution -- don’t feed them, because we don’t want them to associate humans with food.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

We slather on the sunscreen, wear hats and don UV-protective clothing. Meanwhile, our teeth and bones pay the price -- staying out of the sun means we don't activate production of our sunshine vitamin, vitamin D, which is critical to strong bones and pearly whites.In addition to our obsession with UV protection, numerous studies point to the fact that the Dietary Reference Intakes (RDIs) for vitamin D set in the 1990s are no longer sufficient based on new research that shows vitamin D wears more than a "calcium absorption" hat. It turns out that vitamin D could be a strong defensive player against cancer, heart disease, immunity and neuromuscular disorders. Based on this, you can bet that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has set determining the optimal intake of vitamin D as a high priority.Most Americans face a serious vitamin D deficiency, with women having the greatest risk of deficiency. Nearly half of us don't meet our recommended daily intake for vitamin D, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Dietetic Association.A lack of vitamin D in our diets has put us on a path toward some serious health problems. Studies show that a lack of vitamin D may put people at risk for diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis.Geography, age, skin color and the amount of SPF we apply plays a serious role in how much or how little vitamin D our bodies produce. Today, most vitamin D comes from the foods we eat. Fish is one of the few foods naturally rich in vitamin D. Tuna, salmon, sardines and mackerel are especially excellent sources of vitamin D, but it's unlikely that we're eating enough to make up for our vitamin D deficit. Products such as milk and yogurt, certain baked goods and oil spreads usually pack extra vitamin D, too.So, how much should be we be getting? Well, we won't know for sure until the IOM sets new recommendations. You can visit your doctor and request a blood test for the active form of vitamin D, known as 25 hydroxy D3. The amount of vitamin D needed to maintain optimal levels in our blood has not yet been established, but initial studies suggest the range to be a concentration somewhere between 40 and 80 nanomoles/liter. This test can be taken at your annual check-up to see how effective your diet is in providing you with vitamin D.In the meantime, eat the foods I've mentioned as being high in vitamin D. You can also supplement 200 IUs per day (if you're under 50 years of age) or 400 IUs a day (if you're over 50 years of age). Eating a LUNA bar is another great way to get vitamin D, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium and folic acid, that women need.

Brown's skill at commercial direction showed, with slick, well-timed segments that conveyed maximum information with enough fluff to keep it watchable.The legion of fans built quickly.  Calling themselves "Briners," a term that will be explained below, fans formed web communities, followed each episode obsessively, got together for marathon cooking sessions and, of course, haunted every public appearance by their guru.I will never forget the first time I met Alton, at a book signing in Dallas after his first book, "I'm Just Here For The Food," was released.  The bookstore had set out 50 or 60 chairs, and nearly 300 people showed up.  When he came out from the back, Brown saw the assembled crowd and had a brief deer-in-headlights moment before recovering and spending far longer than originally planned signing books, chatting and taking pictures with fans.Remember: This was the Era of Emeril, when TV chefs were thought to be largely untouchable, or at the very least unapproachable.  To have a show host come down from the mountain and hobnob with the hoi polloi was unheard-of.  We (yes, I'm a Briner) were sold.With a loathing for "unitaskers" but a love for quality gadgetry, Alton was responsible for some considerable purchases in my household when the show began.  It became a running joke that Bed, Bath and Beyond always just happened to have on sale whatever gadgets had been featured in that week's show.  I learned that paying more for truly good quality wasn't a bad thing, but also that sometimes TV show hosts can afford things I can't."Good Eats" made stars out of its guests, as well.  Merrilyn Crouch, who played Alton's clueless sister Marsha in several episodes, and even more notably Vickie Eng, who played gadget expert and master of snark "W" many times, both had their own legions of fans. Culinary anthropologist Deb Duchon and master baker Shirley Corriher provided necessary bits of book learnin', but also were woven into the plots of episodes, rather than simply appearing to dispense wisdom.Like most great shows, every fan has his or her favorite episode.  With the help of my friends at one of the longest-running and largest of the "Good Eats" communities, theGood Eats Fan Page, I've assembled a list of the 10 foods that Alton Brown either taught us most about or made just flat hilarious episodes about.10: Haggis.  In "Oat Cuisine," Brown takes on the character of a Scottish peasant to tell us how to make our very own haggis at home.  While I don't know anyone who actually tried it, the bit is hilarious and worth watching.9: Oatmeal. From the same episode came the recipe for Overnight Oatmeal, using steel-cut oats and dried fruit to create one of the great breakfast dishes of all time.  Both my sons were raised on the stuff, and it's become a family favorite.8: Squid.  "Squid Pro Quo" is one of the greatest episode titles in the series' run.  Brown has a flair for puns and cultural references in his titles.  The show itself, based upon the pursuit of a mythical sea monster, is hilarious, and the Squid Vicious recipe makes calamari accessible to even the most inexperienced cook.7: Coffee. Here's an episode that, to me, is emblematic of the show's highest purpose: taking things we've all made for years and showing a better way, with plenty of tasty science to back it up.  Tired of bitter coffee? You're not using enough grounds.  I buy a lot more coffee now than I did before this show, but "True Brew" showed me how to make java that both wakes me up and leaves my taste buds intact.6: Pot roast. In "A Chuck for Chuck," we meet Chuck, a clueless fellow played by Daniel Pettrow who frequently appears and is educated by Alton.  The foil-wrapped, aromatic-laden chuck roast made here isn't your mom's pot roast ... it's better.5: Fried chicken.  I spent the better part of 10 years trying to perfect my fried chicken recipe, trying everything from self-rising flour (disastrous) to various seasoning mixtures in pursuit of perfection.  In one half-hour episode, "Fry Hard II: The Chicken," Alton tossed out most of what I'd learned and showed me the error of my ways.  I haven't made bad chicken since ... which my cardiologist is not happy about.4: Roast turkey. "Romancing the Bird," the first "Good Eats" Thanksgiving episode, is perhaps the most-cited by fans and non-fans alike as being where Alton truly staked out his territory as a culinary revolutionary.  With statements like, "Stuffing is evil," he sent legions of us scurrying for vegetable broth, peppercorns and spices to brine our birds, and aromatics to put inside the body cavities.  A lot of us also learned that our ovens were, indeed, capable of reaching 500 degrees. This is where the Briners nickname began.3: Chocolate-chip cookies.  "Three Chips for Sister Marsha" was, for me, the point at which I became a kitchen science nut.  Starting with the basic Toll House cookie recipe, Alton brings the science to make three different styles of cookie: the Thin, the Chewy and the Puffy.  The explanation of how fats and proteins work to bring about the different end results, explaining for example the difference between using melted or softened butter or bread vs. all-purpose flour, was eye-opening.2: Biscuits. Again, we have a simple food that for many people has become something bought premade or, at best, made from a mix.  With help from his real-life grandmother, Mae Skelton, Brown brought the science and the craft together to show how even the most fumble-fingered baker could make good biscuits.1: Steak.  This is a purely personal choice.  I spent years paying good money for steak in restaurants that almost always disappointed me on some level.  In the very first "Good Eats" episode, "Steak Your Claim," Brown showed how using good beef, minimal seasoning and an insanely hot cast-iron skillet could prevent me from ever wasting another dime on restaurant steak.There are dozens of other great moments and episodes, and everyone's got their favorites.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention two of the greatest "stunt" innovations the show debuted over the years: the drill-aided pepper grinder and the exhaust-pipe Weber grill.  With the first, Alton attached a power drill to the mechanism of a pepper mill in order to coat an entire salmon flank.  With the second, he attached a length of exhaust pipe to one vent of a Weber kettle grill and stuck a hair dryer in it to create a blast-furnace effect.  I have seen both done in countless videos with often hilarious results."Good Eats" reruns move now to the Cooking Channel, where they've been edited to wedge in more commercials.  One of the great things about the shows was that there was very little wasted space, and in most cases I've seen so far the editing is done with all the finesse of a broadsword hitting a peasant. My recommendation?  Pick up the DVDs on sale and see all the tasty extra footage and commentary included.  There are even a few with Q&A sessions fueled by Good Eats Fan Page members.For those of you mourning the end of the series, cheer up!  This just leaves more time for FN to annoy us with Guy Fieri, reality shows and whatever other vaguely food-related tripe they churn out on the cheap.Got a question? Comment?

But superfoods can help you eat your way to better health without the medications.<COL>iStock / damircudic(NewsUSA) - In order to stay healthy or to overcome disease, many of us rely on drugs and prescriptions. But wouldn't it be nice to have benefits powerful enough to help lower your cholesterol, reduce your risk of heart disease and cancer, and, for an added bonus, put you in a better mood without the side effects? With superfoods, you can.Superfoods possess significant physical and mental health benefits and can be found in a variety of different forms, from blueberries and broccoli to drinks such as green tea. They are both plentiful and are easily accessible at your local supermarket.Aside from their plentiful health advantages, many superfoods taste good as well. Many juices are being specially formulated with additional nutrients, herbs and antioxidants that make consuming a superfood product both great-tasting and convenient for meals on-the-go."Superfoods are a hot topic in the food and beverage industry these days, as companies are trying to satisfy the growing demand for healthier products," said Chris New, founder, chairman and CEO of NBI Juiceworks.The following foods have also been considered to be superfoods:- Salmon. High in Omega-3 fatty acids, salmon is high in protein and low in fat, making it a great choice for any diet.- Walnuts. Studies have shown that this nutritious nut can actually counteract the negative effects of foods that are high in fat.- Dark chocolate. Go ahead and have a piece, guilt-free. Dark chocolate has very high levels of flavonoids and antioxidants, and when enjoyed in moderation, it has a positive effect on heart health.If you are attempting to increase your well-being, incorporating a superfood product into your everyday diet -- along with regular exercise -- may be a winning way to jumpstart your health."Eating and drinking more superfoods is only going to improve your lifestyle and make you more physically fit and mentally sound," New said.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Or, “But you’re putting too much stress on your body!” And finally, “You need fiber! Fiber is necessary!” If you are both my friend and a fan of The Master Cleanse, juicing, etc., you have heard that refrain from me. A lot. I think cleansing is great for losing 10 pounds before that wedding your ex will be at, but for health? Meh. Detoxing is important, but there’s a better way.When we talk about detoxing the body, what we really mean is cleaning out the kidneys and liver. These organs filter out the toxic substances we come into contact every day, including those we purposefully ingest (alcohol, tobacco, chemicals in processed foods) and those that are we take in involuntarily (environmental toxins). Exposure to too many of those toxins can make those organs a little sluggish, which is why detoxing is important. Luckily, there are a ton offoodsthat will do that work for us.1. Cruciferous VegetablesBroccoli, cauliflower, kale, boy choy, Brussels sprouts and cabbage are superfoods for a lot of reasons -- fiber, antioxidants, anti-cancer properties -- but they’re also great for detoxing the liver.2. SpicesIf you’re a fan of spicy food, you’re in luck when it comes to detoxing. Cayenne, cinnamon and turmeric all help stimulate circulation anddigestion, which helps to keep the liver humming along.3. GarlicWhen it comes to detoxing, garlic is a powerhouse. It helps to stimulate both the kidneys and liver. It also has powerful antibiotic properties, so if your detox system is sluggish due to an illness, garlic can help support the healing process.4. GreensNext time you’re at the farmer’s market, load up on seasonal greens, like spinach, mustard greens and chard. The chlorophyll in leafy greens supports the liver, and is especially helpful for clearing out environmental toxins like pesticides and heavy metals.5. Berries and ApplesFruit has three things going for it when it comes to detoxing: high water content, easy digestibility, and fiber. When it comes to the latter, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and apples are superstars. Not only do they help the body flush out toxins, they also support liver functioning.6. LentilsWhen you’re trying to detox your body, the last thing you want to eat is digestion-unfriendly meat. But you still need protein. Enter lentils – these legumes are protein-and-fiber rich, which both help you to feel full and support the body’s detoxification process.7. Fresh Ginger RootLike garlic, ginger helps to support both the kidneys and liver. It stimulates digestion, which helps both organs remove toxins faster. Bonus: While your body is detoxing, you might experience some digestive discomfort. Make a tea by steeping grated ginger in boiling water to help alleviate symptoms.8. LemonsAll citrus fruits are good for detoxifying, but lemon is the absolute best. It helps to destroy harmful bacteria, supports the liver, and cleanses the blood. If you’re going through a detox phase, start each morning with a warm glass of water mixed with the juice of one lemon.9.Green TeaCommon sense dictates that when you’re trying to detox your body, you should avoid caffeine. And you should, for the most part. There’s an exception to every rule, and in this case, it’s green tea, which is loaded with antioxidants and supports the liver.10. Omega-3sEvery diet – detox or otherwise – needs healthy oils in it, andOmega-3sare by far the healthiest. Salmon, avocado, flaxseeds and walnuts are all rich sources of this vital nutrient, which supports your immune system, helps to clear out environmental toxins, and stimulates the liver.When it comes to eating these foods, raw or lightly steamed is best, so you don’t kill the nutrients. Add more of these foods to your diet, and your body will be running like a well-oiled machine (oiled byOmega-3s!) in no time.For more healthy living news and features, visitresources.purematters.com– and don’t forget to stop by thePure Matters Shopfor all your vitamin and supplement needs.Source: Pure Mattershttp://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/spring-clean-body-10-detox-foodsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Find out what such a diet entails.<COL>iStock / adlifemarketingAccording to the American Heart Association, a healthy diet can help alleviate three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess body weight.The AHA recommends a balanced diet that includes foods from all the major food groups but emphasizes fruits, vegetables and grains.Fruits And VegetablesThe AHA advises that people eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Not only do these foods contain vitamins, minerals and fiber, they're usually low in calories. That can help you lose weight or make maintaining your weight easier.Breads, Cereal, Grains And PastaA healthy heart diet includes at least six servings of grain products, according to the AHA. Keep in mind that starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn and peas are included in this group.Grains are often low in fat and cholesterol and high in fiber. In fact, oats contain high amounts of soluble fiber, which has been shown to lower cholesterol.Dairy ProductsAdults should include three or more servings of low-fat dairy products in their daily diet. Children should have two or more servings, and teens and older adults need four or more servings every day.It's important to choose low-fat dairy products, the AHA says, because milk fat is high in saturated fats that can raise cholesterol levels.Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, EggsThe AHA recommends eating no more than 6 ounces of cooked, lean meat, fish or poultry each day. Poultry should be eaten without the skin and meat should be trimmed of as much fat as possible.The American Dietetic Association suggests including fatty fish in your diet. Fish like salmon, tuna, herring or sardines are rich in a type of fatty acid called omega-3, which thins the blood and makes blood cells less "sticky" and less likely to clot and cause a heart attack. Both the AHA and the ADA suggest you include fatty fish in your diet at least twice a week.Diet Can Help Lower High Blood PressureYour diet can also help keep your blood pressure low. The AHA suggests eating less than 2,400 milligrams of sodium a day. Keep in mind that many prepared foods contain high amounts of sodium.Alcohol consumption should be limited to one drink a day for women and no more than two drinks a day for men.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The high-fat, high-salt American diet is largely to blame: It's easier to eat junk than reaching for a healthy alternative.The deeper cause for heart disease is low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that delivers cholesterol around the body and high sodium, which raises both blood pressure and the chance of heart attacks and strokes.It's no fun to cut out salty snacks and red meat, but tasty alternatives can help you stay proactive about heart health without eating boiled chicken and rice cakes.If health isn't your hot button, simply eating better can also save cash. Turkey is certainly cheaper than steak, and a good diet can help negate the need for expensive high-cholesterol medication.Check out five easy alternatives that can go a long way ...No. 5: Soy nutsSnacking can be tough when you're keeping heart health in mind, but getting that crunchy fix is still possible without saying goodbye to flavor.Studies show that nuts lower the level of bad LDL cholesterol, and even lower the risk of developing blood clots. Nuts are also packed with fiber and heart-healthy vitamin E.Soy nuts might not sound like something satisfying to munch on, but, prepared right, they can give you a crunchy snack fix without munching on high-sodium or high-fat snacks.Instead of reaching for chips, toast some soy nuts with Italian herbs and some olive oil. And instead of salty nuts, try some toasted soy nuts with a dusting of sea salt. Taco seasoning can also give soy nuts a little bit of spice.Mixing those soy nuts with almonds or walnuts can make for a very satisfying medley that doesn't carry the high fat or high sodium of chips and dip.No. 4: TurkeyThe old way of heart-healthy eating meant sad, flavorless boiled chicken and white rice -- yuck.But no more. With countless cuts of turkey in your grocery store, you can get away from those tired chicken breasts without reaching for red meat.Burgers are the best, but getting that grill fix and staying healthy can be tricky.Ground turkey, however, can be a great alternative for heart health that will still give you something to eat at the weekend barbecue.You can spice it up with good herbs and grill it with olive oil. Pop some cheese on top for the whole package -- just stick to part-skim or a little high-flavor, small-serving gourmet cheese.Turkey can also replace beef in spaghetti sauces to get a little more flavor beyond the vegetarian sauce snoozer. Get it ground or chop it roughly for a chunky meat sauce.No. 3: FishGoing without red meat is the No. 1 thing you can do to stay on top of your heart health. But going without a good steak can get awfully boring, and turkey just doesn't cut it sometimes.So if you're looking for a big hearty meal, try a good size piece of salmon and some roast veggies. You'll get that big meat feeling, and plenty of taste, but instead of gristly beef fat, you're getting healthy omega-3 fatty acids.While replacing all your meat with salmon might get expensive, other fish are also packed with those healthy fats. Trout and herring are great places to find those good fatty acids.No email address was supplied by.

Find out what you should be consuming each day.<COL>iStock / gvictoria(NewsUSA) - Although consumers say they are at least somewhat knowledgeable about nutrition, new research from the International Food Information Council (IFIC) shows several wide gaps between American's perception of their nutrient intakes and reality.."While there is some disparity between perceived nutrient adequacy and actual nutrient intake, it is notable that consumers recognize the benefits their food can offer," says Sarah Romotsky, registered dietitian and associate director of health and wellness at the IFIC Foundation. "Indeed, health-promoting foods and food components, like blueberries, yogurt, fish, milk and fortified breads and breakfast cereals, play an important role in meetingnutrient needsand improving overall health."According to the 2013 IFIC Functional Foods Consumer survey, however, the majority of respondents (almost 70 percent) believe they fall short of meeting "all or nearly all" of their nutritional needs.What's more, a comparison of the survey's findings and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data shows gaps between how many believe their intakes are adequate versus recommended daily intakes or nutrient intake recommendations (Dietary Reference Intakes from the Institute of Medicine). For nutrients such as vitamin D (68 percent perception vs. 32 percent consumption), potassium (61 percent vs. less than 3 percent) and fiber (67 percent vs. 5 percent), the discrepancy between perception and reality is glaring.The high percentage of consumers who are meeting their needs for B vitamins may be a testament to how fortification can help consumers meet their nutrient needs."Breads, rice and cereals, which are often fortified with B Vitamins, may be helping consumers meet their B vitamin needs, without the consumer realizing the added value," says Romotsky.However, there are still gaps in knowledge and consumption of a variety of other beneficial components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, flavonoids and zeaxanthin.The good news, though, according to the survey, is that consumer interest in learning more about foods with benefits beyond basic nutrition remains high. Almost nine in 10 Americans say they are interested in learning more about foods that have health benefits beyond basic nutrition, but cited barriers such as price.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

It's also lightweight enough that most handy folks swap out a unit without a helper. Yet if this is all true, you might be wondering, then why are so many dishwashers installed improperly? We've all seen dishwashers with doors that rub against the cabinets or those that lurch forward when a full rack is pulled out. The answer is a bit of a paradox: Like painting a house, installing adishwasheris easy enough that a lot of people will try it with little or no prior knowledge or experience, and some of us just have to learn the hard way.Water Line WarningsYou have to buy your own water supply hose and fittings for a new dishwasher. What you need is a 3/8-inch O.D. braided steel, flexible water hose with female 3/8-inch compression fittings on both ends. Don't buy one with a garden-hose-sized connection on one end, even if the thing is labeled "Dishwasher Hose." You also need a water line angle fitting for the dishwasher end and a two-port shutoff valve for the water supply pipe under the kitchen sink (if it doesn't already have one). Tighten all connections carefully and check thoroughly for leaks before buttoning up the dishwasher and forgetting about it. A small leak under the appliance might go unnoticed for a long time, wreaking havoc on your subfloor and everything below.Insufficient Door ClearanceWith the door closed, a dishwasher should be centered between the flanking cabinets and have an even reveal at the top (assuming the countertop is level). If your door rubs against a cabinet, remove the mounting screws (see discussion below) and tap or pry the dishwasher over for more clearance, then install the screws in new pilot holes. If the door grazes the countertop, remove the kick plate at the bottom front of the dishwasher, and use channel-type pliers to turn the feet—they have threaded posts for adjusting height—to lower and/or level the unit as needed.Problems with the Mounting ScrewsThe only thing holding a dishwasher in place are two screws securing little metal tabs (above the door) to the underside of the countertop. The thickened edge of a laminate countertop is 1 ½ inches. Guess what happens if you use 2-inch screws? Same thing goes for solid-surface tops (such as Corian). So, don't use screws that are too long, and be very careful when driving them, just to be safe.Granite and other stone countertops present a special challenge, since there's no wood substrate to screw into. Whatever you do, don't try to screw into the stone. Remodeler Tim Hewittsaid on Hometalk.com, "The use of side brackets is the normal way to secure a dishwasher in place with a granite top." You can anchor the dishwasher to the flanking cabinets, provided the appliance has side-mount tabs (many newer units do). If not, you can glue a wood strip or two small blocks to the underside of the countertop, then screw the top tabs into the wood (not the stone). In any case, talk to your countertop supplier or installer for recommendations.Faulty Drain HookupEvercalled a plumberin a panic because your kitchen sink drain was backing up into your dishwasher? If so, you know that this is every bit as gross as it sounds. This can happen if the dishwasher's drain hose isn't connected to an air gap device or, without an air gap, the hose doesn't make a high bend that reaches above the water level in the sink. Another classic mishap is to connect the drain hose to a garbage disposer but forget to remove the plastic knockout plug inside the disposer's nipple, so the drain line is effectively sealed shut. A tap with a screwdriver and hammer removes the knockout; just remember to fish it out of the disposer before running it.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/dishwasher-installation-mishaps-and-fixeDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Some of the criteria was the diet had to be easy to follow, nutritious, safe, and be effective for weight loss, as well as heart disease and diabetes prevention.Take a look at the top-five ranked diets.1.DASH dietThe DASH diet was originally created to help fight high blood pressure, but it has also helped people lose weight and achieve a healthier lifestyle. The basic premise for following the DASH diet is to practice what we’re often told – to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, while avoiding foods high in calories and fat.2.TLC dietTherapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet’s main goal is to lower your bad cholesterol levels through cutting back on saturated fat. The diet has to set a calorie goal for yourself and then cut back your saturated fat intake to 7 percent of your daily calories.3.Mayo Clinic dietThe Mayo Clinic diet focuses on weight loss, claiming participants will lose 6 to 10 pounds in the first two weeks and then 1 to 2 pounds a week after. The diet focuses on developing healthy habits that participants can continue for life, and teaches dieters how many calories they should be consuming.4.Mediterranean dietThe Mediterranean diet claims to help participants lose weight and prevent numerous chronic diseases. The diet focuses on eating a lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, legumes, olive oils and herbs and spices. It also emphasizes eating fish or seafood a couple of times a week and eating poultry, eggs, cheese and yogurt in moderation.5.Weight WatchersThe Weight Watchers diet is aimed at weight loss, and says on average dieters will lose about 2 pounds each week. The Weight Watchers program allows dieters to eat whatever types of foods they’d like, as long as they stay within their daily points goal (each food is worth a certain amount of points, and dieters are given a point total to stick to each day based on their age, weight, gender and height).iStock / adlifemarketingA healthy diet can help alleviate three major risk factors for heart disease.

However, our top five best nude beaches are the "Full Monty," so proceed with caution!While many of the world's best nude beaches are located outside the United States, there are several beaches across the nation that encourage visitors to bare all.

Channel 2 caught up with Love, who is in town for a celebration of the organization's 40th anniversary.Below is a Q&A with Love, and a look ahead at what PFD checks may look like this year.Q: So what were the goals of AKPIRG in the early days?A: The reason it was created was to build, outside the regular political interests, Republicans vs. Democrats, a voice for the public interest and a voice for workers in the political process. I'm glad to see they're still active today and getting ready to make a push to become even more active again.Q: Can you describe what motivated the creation of the Permanent Fund was created?A: There was a concern among a lot of people, both liberals and conservatives, young people and old people, that the tendency of the government would be just to spend whatever came in and spend it on projects, in some cases, of dubious value. The permanent fund was designed to be a way to ensure that the people living in the state at the time would not be the only beneficiaries of the wealth, and also to provide a fair way to distribute the wealth. ... You want to give the people that were born here, the people that grow up here, some kind of a fair shot at a future.Q: How well has the program achieved a balance of saving for the future and investing in people who are here right now?A: Alaska has done some good things with its oil wealth and done some things that are less productive. ... I'm always interested in seeing how things are done in Norway, because it has a lot of similarities with Alaska. They've invested really well and done a great job. There are also some really bad examples in the oil area; it's considered a really mixed blessing, especially in places without a well-developed economy. ... Sometimes you just have a lot of inflation, a lot of wasteful projects, boondoggles and things like that in different countries. So overall, Alaska has done relatively well.Q: What could the state do better?A: The state has always had a problem of thinking about how to develop jobs and economy in a state where it's expensive to do things, where you're far from markets. You have tourism of course, you have the fishing industry, you have the oil industry, but all these extractive industries are kind of boom and bust cycles. I think that in a way you have to be realistic about what are the sustainable industries you can do in a place like Alaska.Q: Does anything specific stand out from your time here?A: One of the big regrets I have in 1979, we came within one vote in the Senate of setting up a statewide healthcare system. I don't know if people remember that. But there were moments in the 70s when people were very ambitious about what we were trying here, long before it was close anywhere else.Q: What prompted the creation of the Permanent Fund?A: You want to give the people that were born here, the people that grow up here, some kind of a fair shot at a future.Michael Burns, executive director of the Permanent Fund Corporation, said Thursday that the fund came into being because of the "libertarian streak that's so important to Alaska," he said. "The idea was to starve the beast of government.”Burns also said the most obvious result of the fund will soon be known.Within a few weeks, he said, the amount of the Permanent Fund Dividend will be announced. This year has been strong, with preliminary returns on the corporation's investments estimated at 10.9 percent.But dividend checks are calculated on a trailing 5-year average, meaning the height of the economic crisis will still bring down the number on the checks Alaskans will get in October.Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

If the levels are close to the cutoff criteria, the American Heart Association conducts its own lab testing to verify that the product's nutritional content.There are three kinds of certification that can be obtained, each based on the nutrition content of a single serving size,  as determined by the manufacturer.The first level is standard certification. To be granted this certification, products must contain 3 g or less of total fat, 1 g or less of saturated fat, less than 0.5 g of trans fat, 20 mg or less of cholesterol, 480 mg or less of sodium, and 10 percent or more of the daily value of one of six vitamins and minerals: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or dietary fiber.The second level of certification that can be obtained is whole grains certification. The food must meet the same criteria as the standard certification -- except the total fat content, which is allowed to be as high as 6.5 g -- and the product must contain a certain proportion of dietary fiber and 51 percent whole grains by weight.The third level of certification is whole-oats soluble fiber certification. It must meet the same criteria as the standard certification except the amount of total fat, which is not considered if it is derived from whole-oat sources alone. If the total fat is derived from non-whole-oat sources, the cutoff is 3 g. The product must also contain 0.75 g or more of whole-oat soluble fiber.Meat, which is considered under different criteria, have to meet U.S. Department of Agriculture standards for "extra lean" and contain less than 5 g total fat, less than 2 g saturated fat, less than 95 mg cholesterol, less than 0.5 g trans fat, 480 mg or less sodium, and at least 10 percent of one of the following: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or dietary fiber. However, the American Heart Association does not certify beef ribeye or strip steaks.The heart-check mark is an indicator of very specific components in the foods that apply for certification. Products should be taken as a whole, and consumers should still examine product labels to make informed decisions about the food.Remember, the mark does not take into account any heart unhealthy components that may be present in the products. Products that pass the above criteria may still contain high levels of sugar, have a high caloric content or lack important vitamins.A heart healthy diet can be achieved by following the D.A.S.H program, which is rich in fruits and vegetables, low in sodium and simple carbohydrates, and includes whole grains, high-fiber foods, lean meats and poultry, fish, and fat-free or 1 percent fat dairy products.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Marks, Pure MattersStart by staying physically active, says Gary J. Kennedy, M.D., past president of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. "The rule of thumb is that a senior needs about a half hour of exercise every day," he says.That doesn't mean you have to take up jogging or head for the basketball court. Exercise can be as simple as a half-hour walk on most days of the week at a pace that lets you carry on a conversation and not get out of breath. Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you. Then make it part of your daily routine, Dr. Kennedy says.Even if you're living with a disability, Dr. Kennedy says, you can stay active. Try range-of-motion calisthenics, for instance.If it's icy or frigid outside, you can work out indoors, he says. If it's not icy, you can dress warmly and head outside.Physical activity isn't just good for your body. Research shows that regular aerobic activity -- the kind that raises your heart rate -- can reduce or prevent symptoms of depression and anxiety, says psychologist Kathy Hogan Bruen, Ph.D., senior director of prevention for the National Mental Health Association.Dr. Kennedy suggests other ways that seniors can focus on "successful aging" in any season:Don't let winter take a bite out of your diet: Pay attention to nutrition, especially to getting enough fruits and vegetables. You can find a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables year round at the supermarket, or buy frozen fruits and vegetables to have them on hand if the weather turns bad and you can't get to the store.Also, be sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D, available as supplements or in fortified, ready-to-eat cereals. Omega-3 fatty acids may help your heart health, so be sure your diet includes a little bit of fish, nuts (specifically walnuts), and soybeans, says Susan Moores, R.D., a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.If you'd like to learn more about good nutrition, sign up for a class at a local hospital or through a community education program. Have a meal with friends, says Moores. "Appetites seem to perk up when you enjoy company while you are eating."Source: Pure MattersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

He says the increase in inventory isn't due to more collisions, but rather, he believes it's the result of some early spring cleaning."Several of the Trooper posts have done some clean-outs and some of our outlying offices did some clean-outs and had some empty trucks coming into town that were able to bring the stuff in for us,' said Holmes.In addition to moose antlers, there are a few sets of Dall sheep horns and more than 60 black and brown bear hides.The Alaska Trappers Association is contracted with Fish and Game to take the horns and hides and prepare them for auction during Fur Rondy. The revenue generated from the auction goes to both Fish and Game and the trappers association.Trappers association Southcentral chapter chair Richard Person says the organization uses the funds to promote trapping and provide community education about trapping."Help people to avoid trap lines and keep their pets out of traps and if they get in how to get them out," he said.Person said the horns often go to artist to create unique artwork, while the hides are often auctioned to hunting enthusiasts."The brown bears are always kind of a unique deal. A lot of people don't have access to the brown bears, and so this is a good opportunity for folks who want to acquire a brown bear hide legally," said Person.Both Holmes and Person say the auction typically brings in between $40,000 to $60,000. This year, with the extra items up for bid, it could yield even more.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Instead, they stick around town, seen by the public at gathering grounds like Westchester Lagoon and Cuddy Park.<COL>They're supposed to head south for the winter.  So Why are they sticking around?  State biologists want some answers on Anchorage's mallard duck population.Every winter, hundreds of Mallard ducks in the Municipality of Anchorage don't fly south to the Pacific Northwest, as waterfowl biologists say they should. Instead, they stick around town, seen by the public at gathering grounds like Westchester Lagoon and Cuddy Park."This is not a natural situation by any means. We get more questions about the Cuddy Park mallards than we do most other waterfowl species," said waterfowl biologist Mike Petrula, with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. "Frankly, we don't have all the answers."Fish and Game recently began a new study -- a pilot project to help them learn more about the ducks' nutritional states, survival rates and food sources. Biologists want to know if the ducks are finding food in their natural environment or simply relying on handouts."It's amazing what is thrown out here," Petrula said. "I think sometimes people just clean out the refrigerator -- there's melon rinds, whole squash and oranges and limes, and every once in a while a slice of pizza."On Friday, biologists set a trap in the pond at Cuddy Park, luring the ducks with cracked corn and barley. After waiting nearby for almost three hours, there were enough ducks inside the caged trap -- nearly 30 -- for biologists to close the remotely operated door.Biologists brought the birds to the parking lot, where they banded them with a federal number and a bright red-colored band so they can easily spot the mallards they're keeping track of. State veterinarian Dr. Bob Gerlach was also on site, testing the birds for avian influenza."It wouldn't take much for disease to spread throughout these birds so we're going to be taking blood at some point, looking to see if they're carrying any influenza or if they've been exposed to any diseases in the past," Petrula said.The ducks were quickly released after the information was gathered. Petrula said the last photo census showed more than 1,000 ducks at Cuddy Park.Fish and Game plans to conduct the study in the winter and summer for the next few years.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They were taken to Central Peninsula Hospital, but Wilcox says the two men were able to walk up the beach after rescue boats brought them to shore.In an email to Channel 2, one of the rescued crewmen, Allan Baldwin, says wave action capsized the vessel."(W)e took water over the bow and the following sea pushed the boat in and over to lay on its side," Baldwin wrote. "The skipper climbed down into the filling house and was able to exit the door which I had already exited, it was all I could do to hold open the door while he pulled himself against the pressure of the waves!"As the boat abruptly overturned, Baldwin says his sense of both time and space aboard were affected."We never got too excited, just knew we needed to get to the driest spot," Baldwin wrote. "As the boat turned over it seemed like slow motion yet took seconds, I was disorientated for a second because I was standing on the wall instead of the floor and water filling a boat is a bad feeling!"Baldwin credits local emergency services for their quick response to the sinking, despite a moment when it wasn't clear whether they had been contacted."I placed a call to 911 but lost my footing and dunked my phone," Baldwin wrote. "I knew a call made it when through the fog I saw red lights on the bluff, then again on the beach? We have great fire rescue people in Kenai and thankfully (those) people watch the river mouth all the time."Officials are say they are aware of the sinking, and they are asking people to not call 911 to report the boat, which is partially submerged south of the mouth of the river near Chinulna Point.Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Contact Mike RossCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The people have changed.”Olick loves his community: his wife, the rest of his family, his friends, the fish camp he keeps all summer, the mushing dogs that help him stay busy all winter.“I know everybody in the village,” he says. “I want to make a safer place for people to live in.”There are problems that have grown stronger in recent years, Olick says.“We are hard hit by drugs and alcohol,” he says. “It changes everything.”Olick is used to doing his job unarmed, but there have been close calls.One incident he remembers in particular was a standoff. He was confronted by a man wielding a high-powered gun.“I couldn’t even run, I couldn’t even hide,” Olick says. “Getting shot at that time was imminent.”“I called the troopers, but they mentioned something about, ‘we’ll be there tomorrow.’”The situation ended after more than five hours when the man unsuccessfully attempted to shoot himself in the head, a suicide attempt that failed due to the length of the barrel of the gun.Things could have ended differently: “If I was armed, maybe he would have been shot,” the VPSO says.While that may have preserved his own life, a fatal ending would have been unspeakably tragic for Olick and everyone in Kwethluk.“If I shoot one individual, that’s a person that I know and grew up with, or somebody’s child that I grew up with or one of my relatives,” Olick explains. “It’s going to be pretty hard for me to live with that.”WARY SUPPORTOlick, like AVCP, supports House Bill 199, a proposal by Rep. Bryce Edgmon (D-Dillingham) that would give regional Native associations the option of arming VPSOs.But that does not mean Olick or AVCP want every officer to have a firearm.Under House Bill 199, the popular proposal making its way through the Alaska Legislature, training would be required and the decision to arm a VPSO would not be made by the state – and that local control is imperative to many rural residents.Moses Owen is a member of the Akiak Tribal Council, and he says the key is making sure the community knows and trusts their VPSO.“We have to make sure these individuals are trained, that they will work with the community and that they won’t use the gun as something that will make them bigger than the members of the community here,” Owen says.Olick agrees.“Maybe it’s time, but the communities who the VPSOs work for should have a say in this."EDITOR'S NOTE: This is second of a two-part KTUU.com series on rural perspectives to House Bill 199, which would arm village public safety officers.Part one can be foundhere.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Whether you have years of unhealthy eating under your belt or you simply want to fine-tune your diet, here are eight heart-healthy diet tips. Once you know which foods to eat more of and which foods to limit, you'll be on your way toward a heart-healthy diet.How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Overloading your plate, taking seconds and eating until you feel stuffed can lead to eating more calories, fat and cholesterol than you should. Portions served in restaurants are often more than anyone needs. Keep track of the number of servings you eat -- and use proper serving sizes -- to help control your portions. Eating more of low-calorie, nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and less of high-calorie, high-sodium foods, such as refined, processed or fast foods, can shape up your diet as well as your heart and waistline.A serving size is a specific amount of food, defined by common measurements such as cups, ounces or pieces. For example, one serving of pasta is 1/2 cup, or about the size of a hockey puck. A serving of meat, fish or chicken is 2 to 3 ounces, or about the size and thickness of a deck of cards. Judging serving size is a learned skill. You may need to use measuring cups and spoons or a scale until you're comfortable with your judgment.Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals. Vegetables and fruits are also low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Vegetables and fruits contain substances found in plants that may help prevent cardiovascular disease. Eating more fruits and vegetables may help you eat less high-fat foods, such as meat, cheese and snack foods.Featuring vegetables and fruits in your diet can be easy. Keep vegetables washed and cut in your refrigerator for quick snacks. Keep fruit in a bowl in your kitchen so that you'll remember to eat it. Choose recipes that have vegetables or fruits as the main ingredient, such as vegetable stir-fry or fresh fruit mixed into salads.Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that play a role in regulating blood pressure and heart health. You can increase the amount of whole grains in a heart-healthy diet by making simple substitutions for refined grain products. Or be adventuresome and try a new whole grain, such as whole-grain couscous, quinoa or barley.Another easy way to add whole grains to your diet is ground flaxseed. Flaxseeds are small brown seeds that are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower your total blood cholesterol. You can grind the seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor and stir a teaspoon of them into yogurt, applesauce or hot cereal.Limiting how much saturated and trans fats you eat is an important step to reduce your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of coronary artery disease. A high blood cholesterol level can lead to a buildup of plaques in your arteries, called atherosclerosis, which can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.The American Heart Association offers these guidelines for how much fat and cholesterol to include in a heart-healthy diet:The best way to reduce saturated and trans fats in your diet is to limit the amount of solid fats -- butter, margarine and shortening -- you add to food when cooking and serving. You can also reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet by trimming fat off your meat or choosing lean meats with less than 10 percent fat.You can also use low-fat substitutions when possible for a heart-healthy diet. For example, top your baked potato with salsa or low-fat yogurt rather than butter, or use low-sugar fruit spread on your toast instead of margarine.You may also want to check the food labels of some cookies, crackers and chips. Many of these snacks -- even those labeled "reduced fat" -- may be made with oils containing trans fats. One clue that a food has some trans fat in it is the phrase "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredient list.When you do use fats, choose monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Polyunsaturated fats, found in nuts and seeds, also are good choices for a heart-healthy diet. When used in place of saturated fat, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats may help lower your total blood cholesterol. But moderation is essential. All types of fat are high in calories.Source: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/ART-20047702/No email address was supplied by.

Crews hoped to make another attempt Thursday, conditions permitting.She says significant resources have gone toward trying to free the whale and the next attempt will probably be the last. If crews cannot fully remove the gear, the hope is enough has been done to allow the whale to shed it later.Speegle says the team has removed about 30 feet of netting and gear. Much of the remaining gear was beneath the whale, making disentanglement difficult.The whale was last spotted in Chatham Strait.(Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The $8 million project will triple the amount of space the polar bears currently have. It includes upgrades to their habitat and a brand-new public viewing area.Phase one of the project will include a Polar Bear Transition Center for orphaned or injured cubs and a maternity den, should the resident polar bears mate, said Patrick Lampi, the zoo's executive director.The center will allow the zoo to hold and care for up to six cubs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted the zoo a five-year permit -- the only one issued in the U.S. -- to respond to orphaned polar bear cubs."We're very pleased that they entrust us with that," said Lampi.Zoo officials note an increase in orphan cubs coming from the North Slope. With increased activity in the Arctic and changing sea ice, the zoo wants to be ready, Lampi says."We're looking toward the future -- not knowing what's happening on the North Slope, but indications are that the ice will be forcing more bears on land and forcing more interactions with people which unfortunately resort sometimes in more orphans and injuries," Lampi said.The second phase of the expansion project will double the zoo's capacity for adult polar bears. A braided water stream feature and upgrades to the yard will add to the polar bear habitat. But zoo visitors will also benefit from the expansion. A large, elevated walkway will be constructed to give guests a view of the bears from above.Phase one is scheduled to begin this summer and expected to be completed by 2015. Construction for phase two of the project is scheduled to start in 2016 and be completed by 2017.The Alaska Zoo has about $1.4 million raised for the first phase of the project, estimated to total $1.87 million.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Humpback Whale NMS Photographer: Dr. Louis M. HermanA petition from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game may remove a subgroup of humpback whales from the list of endangered species.The humpback whale was one of the first species placed on the endangered species list in 1970 under the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969, following the devastation to the population due to modern whaling techniques and equipment.“We are petitioning for de-listing given that this sub population is no longer at risk of extinction and in need of regulatory protection under the Endangered Species Act,” Douglas Vincent-Lang, director of the Division of Wildlife Conservation, said in an email. “I would also say that adequate regulatory measures are present to ensure the continued conservation of this sub population.”In the petition to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Department of Commerce, Vincent-Lang outlines a new plan of action for a group of whales with feeding and breeding grounds between Hawaii and Alaska, and the coast of Canada.According to Vincent-Lang, the Pacific Ocean's humpback whales can be divided into three distinct groups: the Central North Pacific stock, which migrates between Alaska and Hawaii; the Western North Pacific stock, which is located primarily along Asia's coast line, spreading to the Aleutian Islands; and the California/Oregon/Washington/Mexico stock.Each grouping of whales has shown unique growth rates separate from that of their Pacific counterparts, as well as unique genetic traits and social habits. Using the 1996 DPS policy definition, Vincent-Lang argues that each stock group could be classified as a distinct population segment.The petition moves to classify the Central North Pacific stock as a DPS primarily so it may be removed from the list.Vincent-Lang thinks the petition is a step in the right direction. He says the increase in population is evidence that the plans set down to help the species recover worked.“The recovery of the humpback whale is an ESA success story and a good example of government and non-governmental agencies and other stakeholders working together to develop and implement conservation actions to recover a species from significant declines. It is important to prioritize this delisting, both to document this ESA success story and to accurately reflect the healthy status of the Central North Pacific population of humpback whale.”The International Whaling Commission did not return emails regarding the matter, but should the petition reach its goal, Vincent-Lang says it would be up to them to regulate commercial hunting and tourism regulations. Currently, only indigenous communities of countries belonging to the IWC are permitted to hunt whales.KTUU's Lacie Grosvold contributed to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That included the pack's alpha pair, which had been fitted with tracking collars as part of an ongoing research project.Doug Vincent-Lang, acting director for the Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation, says the wolves were in an area adjacent to the preserve that has been targeted by the state for aerial predator control, which is part of an effort to boost moose and caribou numbers.But Yukon-Charley Superintendent Greg Dudgeon said the shootings are a setback for a long-term study of wolf behavior that began roughly 20 years ago. He said the Lost Creek pack had been monitored for the past seven years.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

One option would build a road on the western side of the Lynn Canal, terminating in Haines. Drivers would have to take a short-range Alaska Marine Highway System ferry from just north of Juneau to access the road.The state’s preferred option has the road being built on the eastern side of the Lynn Canal, starting 40 miles north of Downtown Juneau. The road would be extended another 50 miles to the Katzehin River, where drivers would catch one of the state’s proposed Alaska-class ferries for the short trip to Haines or Skagway.“There is savings to the state both in capital costs and in operating costs,” said Jeff Ottesen, DOT’s program director. “There is even larger savings to the users in using this system.”Ottesen says on average, it costs $1.72 billion to maintenance a mainline AMHS ferry over 50 years. The state could save a significant amount of money by scuttling one or two of the ferries that wouldn’t be needed if the new road system is built.The total cost of the road project would be $500 million, with an estimated five years to build it.The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council has long opposed the road. They say it's too expensive and dangerous, because it would run through 36 avalanche zones.“Fish and Game has done studies on the bear population, the moose population and the mountain goat, and all the studies say there are going to be animal-vehicle collisions,” said SEACC Legislative Organizer James Sullivan.DOT officials say avalanche mitigation takes place all over the state, and the same precautions would be taken along the new route.“Transportation has become controversial, particularly in Alaska,” Ottesen said. “You get a lot of people who want to see the land left as it is. That is a prudent point of view -- but for the people that live here in Juneau, it's also an opportunity to get out of town.”If the funds are approved, work could begin as soon as this summer.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That presumption will be verified by the archaeologist as conditions permit.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Most other countries have similar rules. In the United States, information about food allergies has to be written in simple terms that adults and older children can understand. The eight foods included in food allergy labeling account for an estimated 90 percent of allergic reactions. These eight foods are:U.S. food labels take some of the guesswork out of label reading, helping you more easily identify foods that could cause an allergic reaction. Here are answers to a few common questions about food label requirements.Food labeling laws require food allergens to be identified even in very small amounts -- but only when they're contained as an ingredient. Manufacturers aren't required to include warnings about food allergens accidentally introduced during manufacturing or packaging (cross-contamination). This common occurrence can cause trouble if you're very sensitive to food allergens.Many manufacturers voluntarily include warnings, but these advisory labels aren't always clear. And, manufacturers have different ways of saying a food allergen may be present. For example, labels may say "manufactured in a factory that also processes wheat" or "may contain soy." The FDA is working to make the format of these advisory labels more consistent so that it's easier to identify which products contain allergens. When in doubt about whether a product contains something you're allergic to, it's best to avoid it until you check with your doctor.Source: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/in-depth/food-allergies/art-20045949No email address was supplied by.

The other men are charged with second-degree murder and first-degree robbery.Marquez' body was discovered just before 7 a.m. Wednesday by an employee of a Tudor Road adult clinic run by Anchorage Community Mental Health Services, according to a police report.The employee described Marquez as badly wounded and "bleeding heavily from the head" and said he "did not appear to be breathing." Marquez was pronounced dead at a local hospital.Detectives describe a brutal attack that was caught on surveillance footage, one that Sgt. Slawomir Markiewicz says was "just horrible to view, even on the video.""He didn't do anything to attract the attention or provoke the suspects," Markiewicz says.In charging documents, police say the footage "shows Marquez being attacked multiple times by four suspects who strike him with a road sign, punch him and kick him."The affidavit says one of the suspects initiates the attack against Marquez by striking him with a road sign followed by a flurry of punches and kicks. The man allegedly leaves and returns to strike Marquez approximately six times with a different road sign while he was "lying on the ground."Two of the other suspects are seen punching and kicking Marquez "several times" in the video, according to the charging documents, while a fourth suspect "appears to assault Marquez, but later appears to try to prevent or limit the extent of the assault."An employee of a nearby Tudor Road liquor store says a man she knew as "Dave" or "David" came into the store around the time of the attack. The man "had what appeared to be blood on his clothing and appeared to have two broken fingers of his right hand," charging documents say."Dave told the employee that, 'Some guy messed with him and his friends, so I beat him up,'" the documents say. "'All I got was $10.'"Police identified the man as Walent, an employee at a restaurant just blocks away, and they learned the suspects lived together in a Laurel Street apartment.A witness identified Lewis, Blankenship and Walent as the suspects seen in surveillance footage, and police identified Matt as a suspect through interviews.Each of the suspects has a criminal record.Walent has a California warrant for a 2011 robbery conviction, Blankenship was convicted in 2010 for burglary and carrying a concealed dagger, and both Martins have a string of convictions burglary and theft.The suspects are being held without bail at the Anchorage Jail.Channel 2's Austin Baird and Abby Hancock contributed information to this story.Contact Chris Klint¿Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

"We are a governing body, and we ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, and you know what we have let the American people down."The delegation is expressing concern for the impacts disagreements on Capitol Hill are having at home.“Do I support making sure veterans are back and, you know, my crabbers up in Bering Sea can go fishing and everything else?" said Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat. "Absolutely. But you've got to open up the whole government."Both senators and Rep. Don Young, a Republican, remain unconvinced the Tea Party strategy will lead to changes in the President's healthcare law.“This is the only disagreement I have with our leadership you can't tie the shutdown to healthcare because as long as you have Harry Reid and the president they aren't going to sign the bill,” said Young.In addition to finding a way to fund the government, Congress must address raising the debt ceiling.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

For the next 18 hours, multiple search and rescue crews scoured a 10-square-mile area. On Monday evening, the Coast Guard suspended the search.Volunteers with the aviation community have spent about 20 hours after the initial efforts of fellow Good Samaritans, Anchorage Fire Department, Anchorage Police Department, Alaska State Troopers and the Coast Guard.McNeal worked for Brice Incorporated, a subsidiary of Calista Corporation, which helped with a plane search Friday that boarded Rita McNeal, a friend of Peter and three other people.Alba Brice, General Manager of Brice Incorporated, says the company is focused on helping co-workers and friends heal from this loss. Brice would not go into detail on company policy but says wearing a personal Flotation Device is required when aboard a skiff.According to the Coast Guard, no law requires adults to wear a PFD, even if they are on commercial vessels, but it's highly recommended."Accidents can happen at any time and the more prepared you are the better you are for surviving a fall overboard or a capsizing," said Jon Jones, a USCG commercial fishing vessel safety coordinator .  "So if you already have flotation on the battle for surviving is already done."Rita McNeal says she believes her son was wearing his PFD since it was never recovered in the boat or anywhere else.The McNeal family says they're extremely thankful to all of the volunteers and people that have reached out with kind words during this difficult time. What's most important to her right now though, is finding Peter and bringing him home."We know it's a long shot, the inlet is treacherous," said Rita McNeal. "We know it's a long shot finding him out there, it's a big, big inlet, but we feel we needed to try."(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

An estimated 27,000 jobs were considered directly caused by this spending pattern, adding $1.4 billion in labor income.Asimilar report released by the State of Alaskaestimated that 1.8 million tourists visited Alaska in 2011, spending an estimated $1.7 billion in local goods and services. Additionally, another $600 million was spent on transportation costs that covered air fare, cruise ships, and ferries.The final report of the survey, "The Economic Importance of Alaska's Wildlife in 2011", was presented at the Alaska Board of Game meeting on Friday, and included information from over 9,000 individuals.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It will take a close look at state laws governing animals from rodents to moose to determine the best management strategy.On Sunday, the board heard public testimony from people interested in wildlife issues. That includes testimony from northern alaska hunters asking to allow snow machines in wolf hunting.Alaska falconers asked the board to take a closer look at regulations governing whether non-residents can take Alaska falcons. the public input process is long and varied, but according to the board chair it's a valuable part of governing Alaska's resources."This is without a doubt the most public process you can imagine. Anyone can put in a proposal. Anyone can come in and testify, and it's just a very open very transparent process and that's one thing I'm very proud of very proud to be part of that team," Ted Spraker said.Nancy Hillstrand has testified before the board for 32 years. She spoke on sea fowl. She told the board it's important for all stake holders to understand the complicated mix of local national and international laws governing wildlife.The board currently convenes every two years.

Think again!<COL>Makes 4 servingsRaised in clean, man-made ponds filled with natural spring water, U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish is an environmentally friendly fish. There's always a steady supply without any fear of depleting the oceans or a need to be concerned about mercury levels. A special diet ensures that these catfish have a consistent mild, slightly sweet flavor. Also, this lean fish is an excellent source of protein and contains omega-3 fatty acids. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, moderate fish consumption – one or two meals a week – is important in a heart-healthy diet. U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish makes a perfect choice for healthy family meals.2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided2 teaspoons olive oil1 teaspoon hot sauce4 (6 to 7 ounces each) U.S. farm-raised catfish fillets2 tablespoons butter2 thin slices prosciutto or country ham, julienned (about 1 ounce)¼ cup sliced almonds, toasted1 tablespoon capers, optionalPreheat the oven to 250° F.Stir together 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, the olive oil. and hot sauce in a small bowl.

"We have about 80 boats up there."The owners of those boats are losing about $1,000 per day, per boat. Even if the shutdown ends immediately, it will take three to five days before fishing crews will be able to hit the water again."Very disappointing," Winfree said. "I know that our legislators in Washington are doing everything they can, but there is not much they can do if they can't get it to a vote."A spokesperson for Sen. Lisa Murkowski's office says he's awaiting word of a response from Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker to a letter Murkowski sent last week, asking Pritzker to let the season begin even if the government is still shut down.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

That's clear by the shag carpet covering the walls of some of the rooms inside. Though some of the décor is a sign of the times it was built, the television studio has modern equipment. It's all supported by donations. KJNP is a Christian AM/FM radio and television station. It's been a steady work-in-progress in the 47 years since its founding.Bonnie Carriker, 83, is the president of KJNP. She has a very active role, taking care of the finances and the bookkeeping. She's been doing it since 1967 on a volunteer basis. The radio station provides volunteers cabins next to the radio station.Carriker dedicated her life to her faith when she was 10-years-old and it's been a consistent theme throughout her life. She's been a driving force behind the station since it was founded.Carriker grew up in Juneau and went away to Bible College in Springfield Missouri in the 50s. There, she met her husband, Duanne Carriker. Duane knew Carriker's home state through his time in the Air Force stationed in Alaska. He had even met her father before he met Carriker. The two shared an inspired love of their religion. Carriker graduated from Bible College on a Friday and was married on Saturday. The two returned to Alaska as missionaries. The couple worked in Nome and in 1964 were building up a church in Valdez.The Carrikers had two children, 6-year-old Jan and 2-year-old Leland. Their home was connected to the small church where they had to board the windows in the winter because all the snow falling from the roof would smash them otherwise. Duane and Carriker both worked in the ministry. Carriker said he was especially talented, a good singer and a kind-hearted person.When the ground started shaking, Carriker was at home with their two children and Duane was at a second job they worked to supplement their small stipend donated from Outside churches. Carriker described as an out-of-balance washing machine grew to the sound of "a train coming through the house." Bonne rushed to the other room to check on Jan, age 6 and Leland who was just two. She said the shaking knocked her down. Carriker remembers water sloshing out of the fish tank.Someone came to warn the town of a tsunami and Carriker and her children spent the night at a friend's house 10 miles out of town. She still hadn't heard from Duane. Carriker had hope that he was still alive."My husband was the type of person who would go and help people," Carriker said.Duane knew everyone in town. Carriker said about 50 people crammed into that little house. It was there that one of her church members told Carriker nobody was saved from the dock."That was tough," Carriker said through misty eyes.In 50 years, Carriker never remarried."He was a special guy," she said of her late husband. "I don't think I could find anybody that would take the place of him and I never did. There were some that came around, but I just couldn't feel it."Duane's body was never found. There were 32 people that died at the docks that day. Only two bodies were recovered."Everything just disappeared," Carriker said.Carriker said she could not have gotten over losing Duane if it hadn't been for her strong faith."I don't understand how anybody can handle such a severe thing without knowing the lord," she said. "I would have completely fallen apart, but the lord sustained me."Carriker said if she lost Duane for a reason, it was for KJNP. It's been an important part of her life's work since she moved to North Pole. The tower out back was dedicated in his honor."I hope he's proud of it," Carriker said of the work she's done. "I think he would say, 'go Bonnie,' because his heart was in the ministry too.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But pain is nothing compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.<COL>iStock / amaximSince the beginning of time, people have been willing to try just about anything to make themselves feel younger, look more attractive and be more appealing to potential mates.Women seem especially willing to forgo comfort for beauty. From plucking their eyebrows, to cramming their size 10 feet into size 6 shoes, to having fat sucked out of their body through a giant tube, women seem willing to make whatever sacrifices necessary to look their best.Beauty rituals have always been associated with some measure of physical pain. But pain seems like a welcome vice compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.What has the world come to when people are willing to bask in disgustingness just to clear their pores or condition their hair? Apparently (and frighteningly) it has come to this ...No. 5: Bird poop facialEver wonder how those beautiful Geisha women maintain such smooth and vibrant skin? Well, it doesn't come from your typical moisturizer or mud mask.Apparently, nightingale excrement is the secret ingredient in the Geisha facial, and celebrities all over the world have adopted the practice of putting dried bird poop on their faces in the name of beauty. In fact, at the New York City Shizuka Day Spa, you can have bird poop rubbed on your face for as little as $180!While it is true that you can get birds to poop on your car for free, the face is a much smaller target. You would have to stand outside looking up at the sky for hours -- even days -- before you got your whole face covered.But go to the spa and shell out a couple of C-notes and you can be guaranteed to have your face completely saturated with bird droppings while investing only an hour of your time. Who knew?Of course, if you think that's weird, check this out ...No. 4: Sheep placentaIt turns out that sheep placenta -- yes, the afterbirth of a sheep -- can give you clearer, younger looking skin.Whether it is rubbed on the skin as a cream or consumed orally in capsule form, experts (and celebrities like Denise Richards) swear by its beautifying effects.Allegedly, by nourishing your skin with sheep placenta, you will be able to rid yourself of unsightly blemishes and create a luminous glow from head to toe. Not only that, you'll supposedly look years younger.But then again, you are doing this by using a sheep's afterbirth, so, you know, we're just saying. If the gross-out factor doesn't bother you though, then by all means go right ahead and slap some of that sheep placenta all over your body. Who knows, maybe it will actually work.But we wouldn't make any bets about this next beauty ritual paying off ...No. 3: Fish pedicureNothing will keep you on your toes like a good old-fashioned fish pedicure. How does that work? Well, essentially, you place your tootsies into a big bucket of little fish and allow them to nibble away at your dead and dry skin cells until they have had their fill.Why is this better than the typical method of removing dry skin for a pedicure? Well according to John Ho, a salon owner in Alexandria, Va., who first brought the fishy pedicures to America from China, it is unique and more sanitary.Unique? We will definitely give you that one. Sanitary? More like sanitarium. This is just a crazy way to get a pedicure -- and there does not seem to be a whole lot of advantages to it either.Plus, what about those poor fish forced to eat people's nasty, stinky feet? You gotta feel bad for the fish.But don't feel bad for people who are whacked out enough to try this next beauty ritual ...No email address was supplied by.

If the title and previous line didn’t already give it away, allow me to now confess that my August raw food experiment didn't quite work out the way that I’d planned. Let me explain.In anticipation of Rawgust, I prepped, I shopped, I psyched myself up to no end. I chatted it up with my raw foodie friends; they chatted me up in return, and got all excited to welcome me into the raw food fold. I carefully planned out what I was going to eat and drink for the entire week, and made my veggie purchases accordingly. I made sure all of my “raw stuff” was organized on the countertop and in the fridge.I put on my game face and was ready to rock this raw show. I even cleaned up -- who am I kidding, I went all out and *polished* -- my super cool juicer, and pulled out a raw food cook book that I quickly got intimidated by and returned to its revered spot on the shelf. But you get the idea; I was pretty serious about the whole thing.On my first day, this is what I ate.Breakfast(after my steaming hot cup of tea):Green juice: kale, carrots, ginger, banana, apple. Survey says: delicious & filling.Lunch:Mixed greens salad with strawberries and tangerines on top, with a side of fresh apple juice. Pretty yummy, but I don’t think I ate enough.Dinner:Snack:Overall mood for the day:ExcitedEnergy:HighSleep:NormalThe rest of the week went pretty much like that, with a couple of variations in the meals. Then on the morning of Day 5, I woke up to a surprise on my chin. One of the biggest, baddest, most evil looking pimples I have ever seen. Oh, the horror! And to top it off, I also had one of the WORST headaches I have ever known shy of a migraine.After my medicine (that hot cup of survival tea), I called a raw foodie friend to inquire about the craziness that I had just encountered. She said, “Oh honey, you're just detoxing.” Detoxing?! I couldn't believe it. I thought I was a pretty clean eater in general. I couldn't fathom that I had enough toxins in my body to warrant such a public display of truth on my face. And the monster headache wasn’t lying either. I still don’t know how the raw foodies feel about taking supplements or medications, but I reached for the ibuprofen bottle and didn't let go until two tablets had been swallowed.Alright, I guess it's time for the whole explanation-for-raw-food-diet-failure part. Let’s just say things spiraled downward at an accelerated rate after the sushi rolling class I attended on Day 6 ….During the first half of the class, we learned a ton about the history of sushi: how it was actually a necessity before becoming a delicacy; all about the sushi revolution in the U.S. After some mouth-watering demonstrations by the master chef, we were asked to practice our rolling techniques by making our own rolls. Then we were supposed to sample our own rolls so we could judge them. In the end, the catalyst to my demise was nothing more or less than sushi rice.With the gentle prodding of the master chef to “taste my creation,” it was all over with one quick pinch. The chef then had us pair the sushi with our wine of choice. Oh boy. After two sips of that tasty red, the fish started to seem OK to sample because, well, it’s raw too, right? Right ….The next day I ate chicken. Cooked. Game completely over.I must take my hat off to the raw foodies out there, but for me, lesson learned: I love my fire. I’ll keep the juicing, salads, and smoothies up, but going completely raw doesn’t look like it’s in the cards for me anytime soon.I understand how healthy and vibrant a lot of people who swear by the raw food diet must feel. Maybe some day when I have more time, creativity, and feel less intimidated to create amazing raw meals, I’ll give it another whirl. Until then, I’ve got to roll.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/the-raw-diet-wrap-up-from-rawgust-to-rawbustDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Whenever it gets cold,pho, is my go-to comfort food. You’ll find this beef soup at any good Vietnamese restaurant -- the broth lovingly prepared over a 12-hour period. And after you doctor it with a bracing mixture of crushed red pepper, Sriracha hot sauce, razor-thin slices of bright jalapeños, and a spray of fresh lime, it’s spicy, unctuous culinary perfection. And whenever I fall ill, I always cook up a massive pot of Mexican chicken soup, fortified with a hearty dose of serrano chilies.I love spicy food because itfeelscurative.  It originates in hot climates because eating it can cause you to sweat, which cools the body.  When you’re sick, it flushes out your sinuses, boosts your metabolism, and simply makes youfeelbetter–a sensation anchored in the fact that ingesting spicy food increases serotonin production.Turns out, that’s merely the beginning of its health benefits.  Capsaicin, an element found in most chilies, has been associated with lowered instances of bad cholesterol in a 2012 study on hamsters by the American Chemical Society. The American Association for Cancer research also links capsaicin to killing some cancer and leukemic cells and slowing the growth of tumors. It also boasts high levels of vitamins A and C, fights inflammation, and increases blood flow throughout the body. It’s also a common active ingredient in topical skin rubs for arthritis and muscle fatigue.Other spices commonly integrated into spicy Asian dishes have demonstrated similar health-positive benefits. Turmeric, for example, has been linked to prostate cancer prevention, reductions in childhood leukemia, and as an anti-inflammatory.  Other spices like coriander (or cilantro) can deliver a host of vital daily vitamins like folic acid, vitamin A, beta carotenes, and vitamin C, and has been linked to increases in good cholesterol.In my pursuit of spreading the good word of spicy foods here are three dishes from different cultures synonymous with heavenly spicy food. Each includes a link to an easy-to-make recipe. To make it more spicy, leave in the pulp and seeds; to mellow it out, remove those elements for the peppers, or counteract the heat with sugar or lime juiceMexican Chicken Soup with Lime and CornDominant Spice: Mexican jalapeños or seranno chilies, cumin, fresh cilantroThis is my go-to head cold cure. I amp the spiciness up by adding an extra pepper or two, sometimes double the broth, and cut the amount of corn in half to avoid excess starch.  The smell of the soup as it cooks will clear your sinuses before you try it. Add some slices of ripe avocado at the end, and sub chicken breasts for the thighs if you want to go healthy.Thai Beef SaladDominant Spice: Thai chilies, toasted cayenne pepper, fresh cilantro and mintA great dish for the warmer weather, I like to pair this with some fresh jasmine rice to dip into the dressing (a dizzying sweet/sour/hot combo of Thai fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, and spices). And don’t underestimate the spiciness of the Thai chilies -- they’re small, but they pack a punch.Lamb VindalooDominate Spice: Dried Indian serrano chilies, peppercorns, coriander, cuminThis curry dish from central and southwestern India should always register high on the heat scale, and is typically served with rice and a cool yogurtriatawith sliced tomatoes or cucumber. Most restaurants overload the dish with space-filling potatoes, and cook with a lot of oil. Cooking it at home assures you avoid those pitfalls.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/3-spicy-food-recipes-to-heat-up-your-healthDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

If the title and previous line didn’t already give it away, allow me to now confess that my August raw food experiment didn't quite work out the way that I’d planned. Let me explain.In anticipation of Rawgust, I prepped, I shopped, I psyched myself up to no end. I chatted it up with my raw foodie friends; they chatted me up in return, and got all excited to welcome me into the raw food fold. I carefully planned out what I was going to eat and drink for the entire week, and made my veggie purchases accordingly. I made sure all of my “raw stuff” was organized on the countertop and in the fridge.I put on my game face and was ready to rock this raw show. I even cleaned up -- who am I kidding, I went all out and *polished* -- my super cool juicer, and pulled out a raw food cook book that I quickly got intimidated by and returned to its revered spot on the shelf. But you get the idea; I was pretty serious about the whole thing.On my first day, this is what I ate.Breakfast(after my steaming hot cup of tea):Green juice: kale, carrots, ginger, banana, apple. Survey says: delicious & filling.Lunch:Mixed greens salad with strawberries and tangerines on top, with a side of fresh apple juice. Pretty yummy, but I don’t think I ate enough.Dinner:Snack:Overall mood for the day:ExcitedEnergy:HighSleep:NormalThe rest of the week went pretty much like that, with a couple of variations in the meals. Then on the morning of Day 5, I woke up to a surprise on my chin. One of the biggest, baddest, most evil looking pimples I have ever seen. Oh, the horror! And to top it off, I also had one of the WORST headaches I have ever known shy of a migraine.After my medicine (that hot cup of survival tea), I called a raw foodie friend to inquire about the craziness that I had just encountered. She said, “Oh honey, you're just detoxing.” Detoxing?! I couldn't believe it. I thought I was a pretty clean eater in general. I couldn't fathom that I had enough toxins in my body to warrant such a public display of truth on my face. And the monster headache wasn’t lying either. I still don’t know how the raw foodies feel about taking supplements or medications, but I reached for the ibuprofen bottle and didn't let go until two tablets had been swallowed.Alright, I guess it's time for the whole explanation-for-raw-food-diet-failure part.

Marks,Pure MattersStart by staying physically active, says Gary J. Kennedy, M.D., past president of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. "The rule of thumb is that a senior needs about a half hour of exercise every day," he says.That doesn't mean you have to take up jogging or head for the basketball court. Exercise can be as simple as a half-hour walk on most days of the week at a pace that lets you carry on a conversation and not get out of breath. Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you. Then make it part of your daily routine, Dr. Kennedy says.Even if you're living with a disability, Dr. Kennedy says, you can stay active. Try range-of-motion calisthenics, for instance.If it's icy or frigid outside, you can work out indoors, he says. If it's not icy, you can dress warmly and head outside.Physical activity isn't just good for your body. Research shows that regular aerobic activity -- the kind that raises yourheartrate -- can reduce or prevent symptoms ofdepressionandanxiety, says psychologist Kathy Hogan Bruen, Ph.D., senior director ofpreventionfor the National Mental Health Association.Dr. Kennedy suggests other ways that seniors can focus on "successful aging" in any season:Don't let winter take a bite out of your diet: Pay attention tonutrition, especially to getting enough fruits and vegetables. You can find a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables year round at the supermarket, or buy frozen fruits and vegetables to have them on hand if the weather turns bad and you can't get to the store.Also, be sure you're getting enoughcalciumandvitamin D, available assupplementsor in fortified, ready-to-eat cereals. Omega-3 fatty acids may help your heart health, so be sure your diet includes a little bit of fish, nuts (specificallywalnuts), andsoybeans, says Susan Moores, R.D., a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.If you'd like to learn more about good nutrition, sign up for a class at a local hospital or through a community education program.

The following tips can help prevent or relieve digestive ills.See your health care provider if symptoms persist.Although diarrhea can make you feel miserable, it is rarely cause for concern. Bacteria, viruses, emotional upset,stress, and certain drugs can cause diarrhea, says the National Institute ofDiabetesand Digestive andKidneyDiseases (NIDDK). Most of the time, diarrhea in adults goes away by itself. If you notice blood or mucus in your stool; have afeverof 102 degrees or higher, diarrhea for more than three days, or severepainin the abdomen or rectum; or if repeated vomiting or signs of dehydration develop, call your doctor.To help prevent or relieve diarrhea, follow these suggestions:Stress, diet, and ignoring the urge to go to the bathroom can cause constipation. When stools pass through the colon too slowly, the large intestine draws too much water from them, making them difficult to pass, the NIDDK says.These tips can help:When the sphincter muscle between your esophagus and stomach doesn't close adequately, stomach acid can wash back into the esophagus. This createsheartburn, a burning feeling just below or behind your breastbone. This condition is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, orGERD, the NIDDK says. GERD is caused by certain foods and eating habits, smoking and stress, among other things.Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, citrus drinks, chocolate, mint, or spicy foods may help prevent heartburn.These tips can also help:Source: http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/digestive-health/how-to-prevent-and-relieve-digestive-problemsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Can a piece of furniture belong to one gender? Are there women who enjoy baseball cards and overstuffed recliner chairs? Is it possible for a woman to have a favorite guitar lamp? These are real questions, and you, my feminist readers, have a right -- nay, an obligation -- to ask them.Having graduated college with a degree in Women's Studies, and then actually entering and living in the real world, I would like to say a few things: I don't think it's "right" per se to even have a man cave. The idea of a man cave marginalizes ugly furnishings. Isn't it clear that the perception of ugly furnishings in post-Industrial America is based on an intersectional hegemony of authority over knowledge? Can't furnishings exist in the liminal space, the borderlands, as it were? And if a man cave perpetuates a hypermasculine expectation of gendered taste and behavior in men, does it fundamentally disempower women? Ah, whatever. I will probably still get attacked in the comments by the women who have actually taken courses in non-violent coalition-building conflict resolution for multi-ethnic communities.Can we get on with this? Yes, yes we can. The following interior design pieces should only be placed in a man cave. What authority do I have to say this? I edit a home improvement Website. That is all I have to go on, but I am sticking with it.A fish that was once alive:Hipsters do a fantastic job at co-opting ugly home furnishings. Nothing could be more hipster than a hunting trophy, or better yet a cardboard impression of a hunting trophy, hanging on the living room wall, next to the ironic jar of 19th century medical instruments. You know what hipsters have not co-opted yet? Trophy fish. Hipsters love stuffed birds, and stuffed deer heads, but they do not love stuffed fish. Why? Because hipsters take everything that is ugly with a hint of cool in it, and then blow up the cool aspect until whatever it is ceases to be cool. Fish have not made the cut. But you know where trophy fish look awesome? In a man cave.Baseball cards:Do you know any woman who would let her husband hang baseball cards all over the living room? I don't either. A wall of baseball cards, while an ingenious way to get one's husband's baseball card clutter out of the clothes closet, does not work with the French linen curtains, nor with the carefully slipcovered sofa, nor with the hand refinished vintage coffee table. Rather, they match a TV, a recliner, and some brewksies. In other words, baseball cards make a perfect wall covering for the man cave.Overstuffed recliner chairs:La-Z-Boy, the maker of the iconic overstuffed recliner, has launched an aggressive rebranding program. They now produce a line of fashionable living room furniture that is endorsed by Brooke Shields. Brooke Shields was probably a good choice of spokeswoman, because quite a few man caves still have posters of her in them. La-Z-Boy still produces its iconic overstuffed recliner chairs, because, let's be honest, they are hypnotically comfortable, and people are still furnishing man caves. If I were a man with a cave to retreat to, I would definitely want an overstuffed recliner chair. But as a woman, the only recliner I would permit in my living room is an Eames Lounge Chair.Furniture made out of guitars:The guitar tabletop; the guitar lamps; theguitar-shaped toilet seat. Like all other vestiges of teenage boyhood, and its aspirations for rock-stardome or pro sports that never materialized, their proper home is the man cave. They do not "go" with anything except for a pool table, and maybe bar stools.Anything involving pyramids of beer bottles with their labels still on:I am all forupcycling beer bottles. But really, where else, besides a man cave or maybe a bar, can you get away with a chandelier made from a pyramid of beer bottles with their labels still on? Here's the thing, remove the labels and you're entering the lady territory of cute DIY material. So dudes, if you don't want your lady to hoard your beer bottles for DIY projects, shellac the labels on or something.Which brings us to the concluding point: Surely there is a small group of women who are reclaiming the man cave. They are known in academic circles as "DIY bloggers". They are framing their husbands' sports game tickets and mounting them (the framed tickets, not their husbands) to the wall with properly affixed picture hooks. They are hiringpainters in Minneapolis; they are hiringremodeling contractors in Charlotte. They are taking power from the overstuffed couches with hand-crafted throw blankets. They are moving the man cave toward the center, away from its hypermasculine associations. They are raising consciousness and breaking boundaries. Their husbands put up with it, because after all, girls do rule the world.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/things-you-can-only-put-in-a-man-caveNo email address was supplied by.

It's also lightweight enough that most handy folks swap out a unit without a helper. Yet if this is all true, you might be wondering, then why are so many dishwashers installed improperly? We've all seen dishwashers with doors that rub against the cabinets or those that lurch forward when a full rack is pulled out. The answer is a bit of a paradox: Like painting a house, installing adishwasheris easy enough that a lot of people will try it with little or no prior knowledge or experience, and some of us just have to learn the hard way.Water Line WarningsYou have to buy your own water supply hose and fittings for a new dishwasher. What you need is a 3/8-inch O.D. braided steel, flexible water hose with female 3/8-inch compression fittings on both ends. Don't buy one with a garden-hose-sized connection on one end, even if the thing is labeled "Dishwasher Hose." You also need a water line angle fitting for the dishwasher end and a two-port shutoff valve for the water supply pipe under the kitchen sink (if it doesn't already have one). Tighten all connections carefully and check thoroughly for leaks before buttoning up the dishwasher and forgetting about it. A small leak under the appliance might go unnoticed for a long time, wreaking havoc on your subfloor and everything below.Insufficient Door ClearanceWith the door closed, a dishwasher should be centered between the flanking cabinets and have an even reveal at the top (assuming the countertop is level). If your door rubs against a cabinet, remove the mounting screws (see discussion below) and tap or pry the dishwasher over for more clearance, then install the screws in new pilot holes. If the door grazes the countertop, remove the kick plate at the bottom front of the dishwasher, and use channel-type pliers to turn the feet—they have threaded posts for adjusting height—to lower and/or level the unit as needed.Problems with the Mounting ScrewsThe only thing holding a dishwasher in place are two screws securing little metal tabs (above the door) to the underside of the countertop. The thickened edge of a laminate countertop is 1 ½ inches. Guess what happens if you use 2-inch screws? Same thing goes for solid-surface tops (such as Corian). So, don't use screws that are too long, and be very careful when driving them, just to be safe.Granite and other stone countertops present a special challenge, since there's no wood substrate to screw into. Whatever you do, don't try to screw into the stone. Remodeler Tim Hewittsaid on Hometalk.com, "The use of side brackets is the normal way to secure a dishwasher in place with a granite top." You can anchor the dishwasher to the flanking cabinets, provided the appliance has side-mount tabs (many newer units do). If not, you can glue a wood strip or two small blocks to the underside of the countertop, then screw the top tabs into the wood (not the stone). In any case, talk to your countertop supplier or installer for recommendations.Faulty Drain HookupEvercalled a plumberin a panic because your kitchen sink drain was backing up into your dishwasher? If so, you know that this is every bit as gross as it sounds. This can happen if the dishwasher's drain hose isn't connected to an air gap device or, without an air gap, the hose doesn't make a high bend that reaches above the water level in the sink. Another classic mishap is to connect the drain hose to a garbage disposer but forget to remove the plastic knockout plug inside the disposer's nipple, so the drain line is effectively sealed shut. A tap with a screwdriver and hammer removes the knockout; just remember to fish it out of the disposer before running it.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/dishwasher-installation-mishaps-and-fixeDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

If you have ever lived next door to an excavation or demolition site in a city, you probably know these little guys all too well. Here are eight facts about Norway rats that might help you to prevent or cope with an infestation.1. The scientific name for a Norway rat isRattus norvegicus.They are commonly referred to as "rats", "brown rats", "sewer rats", and "wharf rats."2.Norway rats are not really from Norway.The Norway rat,according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, is actually a native of Asia that arrived in England via Norwegian ships.3. Norway rats do not have collapsible skeletons.The myth that Norway rats have collapsible skeletons is most likely based on their ability to squeeze through small holes. However, Norway rats have skeletons made out of bones and cartilage, just like other mammals. While young rats are often able to squeeze through half-inch holes, large and fat Norway rats cannot squeeze through such small holes.4. Norway rats can be over a foot long.According to theBaltimore County municipal website, which is an excellent resource forBaltimore exterminatorsandremodeling contractors, Norway rats can grow 12 to 18 inches long, with five-to-eight-inch-long tails. Have you ever come face to face with an 18 inch rat? It sounds horrifying.5. Norway rat droppings are a half inch long.One sign of an infestation of Norway rats, again according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, is rat droppings. A single rat can make 50 droppings per day. They describe the Norway rat droppings as being about half an inch long, and blunted.6. To get rid of Norway rats, cut off their food supply.Norway rats love to eat garbage, and they are well nourished on it. Norway rats can chew through plastic garbage cans. Metal garbage cans are more resistant to being chewed through by rats. Rats are attracted to human food, especially bulk grains and meat. Seal up your pantry food supplies in Mason jars or metal tins to prevent Norway rat infestation. Norway rats are especially attracted to pet food, so it is vital to clean up spilled pet food, especially outside, as well as to store pet food in a metal bin.7. Norway rats live in burrows.According to the Baltimore County municipal website, rats live in burrows that are 12 to 18 inches underground, and about 10 inches in diameter. You can usually tell where a Norway rat burrow is by the "rat run" leading to the burrow's opening. Unfortunately, Norway rats are very good at burrowing. They can burrow through cement foundations, causing major damage to buildings. Concrete barriers can be buried to prevent rats from burrowing under foundations.8. Norway rats can climb.They are very good climbers. To prevent Norway rats from climbing buildings, trim vegetation and do not allow creeping plants, like ivy, to grow up the sides of the building. Install tree guards to prevent Norway rats from climbing trees, where they are known to harm birds' nests.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/facts-about-norway-rats6Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Then make it part of your daily routine, Dr. Kennedy says.Even if you're living with a disability, Dr. Kennedy says, you can stay active. Try range-of-motion calisthenics, for instance.If it's icy or frigid outside, you can work out indoors, he says. If it's not icy, you can dress warmly and head outside.Physical activity isn't just good for your body. Research shows that regular aerobic activity -- the kind that raises yourheartrate -- can reduce or prevent symptoms ofdepressionandanxiety, says psychologist Kathy Hogan Bruen, Ph.D., senior director ofpreventionfor the National Mental Health Association.Dr. Kennedy suggests other ways that seniors can focus on "successful aging" in any season:Don't let winter take a bite out of your diet: Pay attention tonutrition, especially to getting enough fruits and vegetables. You can find a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables year round at the supermarket, or buy frozen fruits and vegetables to have them on hand if the weather turns bad and you can't get to the store.Also, be sure you're getting enoughcalciumandvitamin D, available assupplementsor in fortified, ready-to-eat cereals. Omega-3 fatty acids may help your heart health, so be sure your diet includes a little bit of fish, nuts (specificallywalnuts), andsoybeans, says Susan Moores, R.D., a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.If you'd like to learn more about good nutrition, sign up for a class at a local hospital or through a community education program. Have a meal with friends, says Moores. "Appetites seem to perk up when you enjoy company while you are eating."Source: http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/stay-active-eat-healthy-to-enjoy-a-sunny-winterDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

She added that officials believed there was still live ammunition in the cabin, which was still smoldering.CNN and other media quoted numerous sources earlier in the evening as saying authorities had removed a body from the rubble of the fire and identified it as Dorner.The cabin caught fire after police detonated smoke devices inside the cabin, the source said.Aerial images showed heavy smoke and flames coming from a structure. The cabin continued to burn for hours after the fire started.One of the two sheriff's deputies wounded earlier Tuesday in the shootout earlier with the suspect died, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon told reporters at California's Loma Linda University Medical Center. The other deputy was in surgery "but he should be fine," McMahon said.The wounded officers were taken to the Loma Linda facility after shots were exchanged with a man at a police roadblock near Big Bear Lake, the sheriff's office said earlier in a statement.The day's confrontations began when a California Fish and Wildlife officer was driving down a highway near Big Bear and he recognized a man fitting the description of Dorner -- target of a massive manhunt since last week -- driving a vehicle in the other direction. The wildlife officer chased the vehicle and the driver opened fire on the officer before abandoning the truck, a statement from the agency said.The officer's vehicle was hit numerous times, the statement said. While not specifically referring to the officer involved in the shootout, the statement said the agency's officers "are all safe and accounted for."Cindy Bachman, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department, said the suspect fled into the woods then into the cabin where he fired at the approaching deputies and holed up though the afternoon, still exchanging gunfire with authorities.Later as the fire burned, with authorities staying back, she said authorities weren't 100% sure the suspect was still in the cabin.Authorities have been searching for Dorner since he was named as the suspect in the shooting deaths February 3 of the daughter of his police union representative and her fiance. Police also say he killed one officer in Riverside, California, and wounded two others last Thursday.The violent spree, authorities say, was part of Dorner's campaign of vigilante justice for what he believes was his unfair termination.Los Angeles police spokesman Lt. Andy Neiman said Tuesday that the department had received more than 1,000 tips on Dorner's whereabouts. Some of the calls have come from Dorner's acquaintances or people who think they have spotted the fugitive.The pace of tips being given to investigators increased by 400% after the city of Los Angeles put up a $1 million reward on Sunday for information leading to Dorner's arrest and conviction, Neiman said.The search for the 270-pound, 6-foot Dorner has focused on the Big Bear Lake area, where authorities say his burning truck was discovered last week.Over the past two weeks, the search, considered one of the largest in the history of Southern California, has taken authorities from Orange County to the border of Mexico and from Los Angeles to Big Bear Lake."Big Bear's still where we're looking right now," Neiman said Tuesday. The search area surrounds where Dorner's burning truck was discovered last Thursday ."Until we can confirm that he's either there or he's not there, this investigation has to stick with what we know and what we know is that we found evidence that he was there," Neiman said.While the LAPD spokesman told reporters he was "not ready to confirm" that a man seen in security camera video from a Southern California sporting goods store was Dorner, the Los Angeles Times quoted unnamed law enforcement sources saying it was him.The video, published Monday by the celebrity news website TMZ.com, shows the man carrying what appears to be scuba equipment at the Sports Chalet store in Torrance, California, on February 1, two days before the killings of Monica Quan, the daughter of the police union rep, and her fiancé, Keith Lawrence.A "no bail" arrest warrant was issued for Dorner after the Riverside County district attorney filed a murder charge Monday against him in the killing of Riverside Police Officer Michael Crain."That allows him to be apprehended anywhere within California, out of state or out of the country," District Attorney Paul Zellerbach told reporters Monday.No email address was supplied by.

For instance, when you put your hands out to break a fall, you land on the heel of your hand. The hands absorb the flat impact and the wrist bends as it absorbs the force, resulting in a fracture. And although this may result in a wrist fracture, it is much better than a potentially life threatening hip fracture -- especially in the elderly.Many falls take place in the home. This is especially true for elderly adults, as balance problems, pooreyesight, and brittle bones combine with household hazards to cause bone-breaking falls.You can reduce the trip-and-fall factor by removing frayed rugs and removing extension cords that could cause a fall. Handrails help steady older adults and children on stairs. Proper lighting lets you see objects on the floor and avoid tripping over them.Strengthening bones is especially important for preteen and teen girls, because women who don't get adequatecalciumandvitamin Das teens may be at increased risk for developing osteoporosis later in life. You can work to avoid osteoporosis, which makes bones brittle, through adequate calcium intake, exercise, and plenty of fruits, vegetables, and vitamin D throughout your life.Calcium requirements change during one's lifetime. The body's demand for calcium is greater during childhood and adolescence, when the skeleton is growing rapidly, and duringpregnancyand breast-feeding. Postmenopausal women and older men also need to consume more calcium. According to the National Institutes of Health, children 1 to 10 years old need 500 to 1,200 mg of calcium each day. Those 11 to 24 years old need 1,200 to 1,500 mg per day. Adults ages 25 to 50 need 1,000 mg a day, and those 51 and older need up to 1,500 mg per day.Your body uses vitamin D to absorb calcium. Being out in the sun for a total of 20 minutes every day helps most people's bodies make enough vitamin D. You can also get vitamin D from eggs, fatty fish, andvitaminD-fortified cereal and milk. If you think you need to take asupplement, check with your health care provider.Doctors still use X-rays to diagnose most broken bones, although more high-tech imaging devices may be used to detect subtle breaks, such asstressfractures. A stress fracture is a tiny fissure in bone often caused by sports overuse.Most broken bones in an arm, leg, hand, or foot require a cast or splint. Heavy, awkward plaster casts have given way to brightly colored fiberglass casts. These are lighter, easier to apply and remove, and more appealing to children.In general, fracture repair is directly related to age. So the older you are, the longer it will take to heal.Doctors can use a variety of mechanical and biological methods to speed healing. Electric and ultrasound stimulation have been used on U.S. gymnasts.The type of fracture also dictates recovery speed. A simple fracture heals quicker that a complicated break requiring bone grafts. Research on genetically produced growth-promoting proteins is promising. Such proteins may decrease extensive surgical fracture repairs.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/healthy-body/bone-health/preventing-broken-bonesDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"We never know when we will be catching the wave. I still hadn't surfed any wave and everyone had already had their rides."What's even more impressive?

Fountain drinks are $2 apiece.Long Branch Saloon1737 E. Dimond Blvd.$7-$15 per plate11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily907-349-4142Among Anchorage’s numerous hamburger eateries, only a few can make a serious claim to best burger in town. Enlisting the aid of a choosy burger connoisseur, I took a trip to one of them in South Anchorage.The Long Branch Saloon can be an easy stop to miss, situated off Abbott Road near a busy curve just east of the New Seward Highway. Flanked by home-improvement warehouses amid an increasingly big-box section of town dominated by the Dimond Center, the saloon’s modest signage (“ICE COLD DRINKS”) and windowless exterior betray little about its contents, let alone the full kitchen inside. As my friend Nick and I entered the building, I smiled at its relative secrecy among local restaurants, given that you have to be in the know to even go there.As befits the name outside, the Long Branch is at heart a bar, a well-settled and lived-in one at that. A single room extends back from the front door with the bar along the left side, and everything else -- two pool tables, a trophy case, a small stage, half a dozen high tables and a round plastic card table for larger parties -- tucked into the other half of the area. A few televisions, not as many as the Tikahtnu Firetap, were tuned to sports channels during our visit, but the lights were low and the place’s mood casually subdued in a way very reminiscent of Club Paris Downtown.Only the menu really hints at the kitchen’s specialty, with an even dozen burgers running the gamut from a plain hamburger to a monster chili cheeseburger topping the main entrée menu. A few chicken and fish sandwiches also populate the list, with an array of dinner and side salads alongside a generous selection of bar-food appetizers, but Nick and I both knew what we’d come for. Given a few minutes to consider the menu, he ordered a bacon cheeseburger ($10.75), while I opted for a grilled jalapeno cheeseburger ($10.25); we made small talk for a while but didn’t have to wait long, with the burgers served up in about 15 minutes.Before I even picked up my burger, I knew I was in for an interesting ride by virtue of what was missing from my basket: the usual dribble of grease which inevitably runs off the average restaurant burger, gluing the ingredients together and soaking the lower bun. The burger before me was conspicuously dry on that count, leaving the extra-large homemade bun to shine on my first bite, its freshly made softness more than worth eating on its own. A layer of jalapeno slices adorned the patty (quite moist, but only when bitten into) amid a mix of melted cheddar and Jack cheese, beneath an abundant portion of cool toppings like lettuce and tomato; grilled to bring out its flavor, the jalapeno’s heat level blended well with the disc of raw onion in the sandwich, and I ate the whole burger as served without so much as a dollop of ketchup.Nick made equally short work of his burger across the table from me, occasionally pausing to sit back and deliver reverent proclamations (“Oh, that bacon's really good -- oh my God”) between bites. He too picked up on the dryness of the burger as it sat before him, a quality he described as “clean,” as in “This one is like a barbecue burger that the chef decided to clean before he served it on the plate.” Before the rest of the burger disappeared, he elaborated on his praise for the bacon in particular, which he said was well-cooked but not overly crunchy.Each of our burgers came with a house-made side, but I opted to pay for an upgrade from French fries to onion rings. About a dozen rings were loosely piled next to my burger, an inviting display of golden-fried batter which I soon turned my full attention to once the burger was gone; sweet onion nestled within a layer of savory breading, they were worth every penny of the added price and are a must-try if you’re a fan of rings. Nick very much liked his fries, equally golden classic examples of the saturated-potato school, which came lightly but not overly salted with a similar attention to detail that kept him plowing through them to the very last few at the bottom of his basket.I can recommend the Long Branch without reservations (I don’t believe they take any) as one of my new favorite local burger stops. This was my first visit, as previous groups I’d been a part of wanted to stop by last year but were turned away at the door by a powerful reek of cigarette smoke; the waitress told us the Long Branch went smoke-free three years ago, and neither Nick nor I noticed even a hint of smoke. Nick declared it better than his previous favorite South Anchorage burger joint, Red Robin, and for my part I can say that it’ll be a short delay before my next visit to the Long Branch.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Because, quite simply, Patrick believes the double-duty weekends help her. Last year Patrick ran 10 Cup races in addition to her Nationwide schedule."Nothing's set in stone yet -- we are working it, though, for sure," said Patrick, who has talked to Turner Scott Motorsports, among others, about Nationwide Series opportunities. "I would love to do 10 Nationwide races. It think that would be our perfect plan, mostly to improve on my Cup experience and be able to learn from some of those races, some of them to have an opportunity to go out and win a race, and others just to get track experience."We're working on it. I think Daytona's looking pretty good, but, beyond that, we're still putting it together… I think the Nationwide Series is a great series, and I noticed that, when I did double duty those 10 times this past year, the Nationwide race really helped my Cup race -- and the Nationwide practice helped my Cup practice."Patrick, who came to NASCAR from the IndyCar Series, also believes the transition to NASCAR's new Gen-6 race car might favor her driving style."I really enjoy high-grip tracks, and I think that getting a car that has more grip in it on these intermediate and short tracks is going to be a really good thing for me," Patrick said. "Obviously, I felt most comfortable at places like Texas or Vegas or somewhere like that…"That's going to be a nice thing for me, especially on those hot days in the summer. Man, it's going to be nice to have some more downforce in those cars."ELDORA TICKETS GOING FASTOscar Wilde once wrote, "Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt," but apparently the 16,000 fans who already have bought tickets for the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Eldora Speedway don't agree."The great thing is we've got less than 1,000 reserved seats left," said track owner Tony Stewart. "We've sold over 16,000 seats to the event already, so things are going well and progressing, and we're pretty excited about it."At Eldora, a lightning-fast half-mile track, the trucks will race on dirt for the first time in series history. The inaugural event is scheduled for Wednesday, July 24.IT'S A… GIRL!While reporters were gearing up for the media tour Monday morning, driver Denny Hamlin broke some news of his own."Introducing Taylor James Hamlin!!!

Today is my 40th birthday and suddenly 40 doesn’t seem old at all.  It seems, well, fabulous. Here are a few things (okay, more than a few, but it is my birthday, so please indulge me) I’ve learned along this 40-year journey:Invest In a Good Haircut– You wear your hair every, single day.  If you can drop $100 for some killer heels you only wear occasionally, you can splurge on your hair.Wash Your Hair Every 3 Days (at most)– As we age, our hair gets drier, so washing it daily just dries it out more.  Wash it a few times per week and if your scalp gets oily in between washes, just dab it with a little rubbing alcohol.  If you have lighter hair like I do, dash some baby powder on the roots for a quick fresher upper.Choose Soft Over Hard– Dr. Phil says to be a “soft place to land” which is my goal when dealing with my friends and family.  Be accepting, warm and inclusive.  This same rule applies to your physical self -- softer is better as you age.  Those few extra pounds fill out the wrinkles (stole this one from my mom).  Have you ever noticed how really skinny women look older?  A few extra pounds is actually a good thing and makes us more feminine.Wear Sunscreen and Get Spray Tans– Oh I wish I had known this during my trip to Hawaii where I wore suntan oil (no SPF) while snorkeling.  My backside hurts just thinking about it.  And sure, a tan looks great, but being a wrinkled prune 20 years later doesn’t.  That being said, everyone looks better with a tan, so get a spray tan, preferably by someone who knows what they are doing.Baby Your Skin– Unfortunately, breakouts aren’t reserved for the young.  Just because you’re out of your teens doesn’t mean your skin miraculously clears up.  I still get pimples, often.  Yes, pimples and wrinkles at the same time, which I don’t think should be allowed by nature.  And don’t pick at your face -- if you pick, it will scar.  And yes, those scars are with you for life.  Lastly, spend more to get quality skincare products.  I learned this relatively recently and boy, does it make a difference.Sleep Matters– In my twenties, I could get by on a few hours of sleep and it wouldn’t bother me.  Now, if I get under 7 hours, I’m groggy and have bags under my eyes.  I used to be able to sleep anywhere, with any amount of noise.  Now, if my dog breathes too loudly, I wake up.  And nap any time you get a chance.  I cannot believe I ever fought nap time.Establish Healthy Habits– Floss nightly.  Workout daily.  Take your vitamins and fish oil.  Stop being an irresponsible procrastinator and just do it.Get and Stay Strong– After age 45, we lose 1 percent of our muscle mass per year.  Why is this an issue?  Because muscle burns calories and I want to be able to eat as many calories as possible and still maintain a healthy weight.  By lifting weights, you can help maintain muscle, while boosting bone strength (bonus!).Keep Moving– A body in motion stays in motion.  It is so much easier to maintain a level of fitness from youth into adulthood than to try to get it back after 20 years on the couch.  Stay active, take yoga, walk whenever possible, take the stairs, play with your kids, break a sweat and occasionally push yourself to where you are uncomfortable.Warm Up and Stretch– Older folks are just more injury prone and when they do get injured it takes longer to heal, so take those extra few minutes to warm up and cool down.  You’ll be thankful you did.Try Something Again– Just because you couldn’t or wouldn’t do something when you were younger, doesn’t mean you can’t or shouldn’t do it now.  Growing up, I couldn’t do a cartwheel to save my life.  Now, I can (thank you core strength training!).Flaws Make You Memorable– I hated my nose and overbite growing up.  Now I love my smile and am thrilled that it isn’t a perfectly porcelain veneered celebrity smile.  Mom always said those flawless teeth looked liked Chicklets anyway.Smile— Speaking of smiles…smile even if you don’t feel like it.  A smile always makes you look better.Breathe– Deep, belly breaths have a calming effect and can even reduce your blood pressure.  When stressed, take five deep breaths and recenter yourself.  Calm is sexy.Savor Good Moments And Good Food– Life truly is too short to pass on birthday cake and chocolate chip cookies.  That being said, life isn’t about eating everything put in front of you.  Be selective…and when you choose something because you love it, savor it.Accept Yourself Today– I thought I was fat in my twenties and now I look at those pictures and think, darn I looked pretty good.  If only I had known it then.  I also thought I was fat in my thirties…you get where I’m going with this?  At 40, I finally have accepted myself, even my nose.  And I know that at 50, I won’t be looking back wishing I had appreciated my 40-year old self.This is just a partial list.  I’m sure there are so many things I still need to learn.  My ultimate goal is to never feel my age or let my age be a limiting factor in any decision I make.  So far, so good.  So far…fabulous!Source:http://blog.purematters.com/prevention/anti-aging/forty-fabulous#more-3292No email address was supplied by.

It caught fire April 20, 2010, resulting in the deaths of 11 workers. Those separate criminal cases remain in litigation.Luke Keller, a vice president of BP America, Inc., apologized again in court Tuesday for his company's role in the accident."We -- and by that I mean the men and the women of the management of BP, its board of directors, and its many employees -- are deeply sorry for the tragic loss of the 11 men who died and the others who were injured that day," said Keller. "Our guilty plea makes clear, BP understands and acknowledges its role in that tragedy, and we apologize -- BP apologizes -- to all those injured and especially to the families of the lost loved ones. BP is also sorry for the harm to the environment that resulted from the spill, and we apologize to the individuals and communities who were injured."The London-based oil giant also agreed to pay $525 million over three years to settle claims with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company concealed information from investors.The oil firm has not agreed with the Justice Department on a separate civil settlement involving federal and state claims of damages to natural resources. At stake are potential fines for violations of the Clean Water Act, which could range from $5 billion to almost $20 billion if BP is found guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. That case is being heard by another federal court in New Orleans.According to Justice Department officials, $1.3 billion of the $4 billion fine will go to the government, nearly $2.4 billion will go to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and $350 million will go to the National Academy of Sciences.Copyright 2013 byCNN NewSource.

You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.<COL>iStock/YinYangIt being the New Year's resolution season, the top things on everyone's lists seem to be eat healthy and save money.However, these aren't just goals to which we should aspire once a year. Everyone would probably agree that we always want to save money and we always want to eat healthy.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap. If you want another layer of protection, use a water filter. A $7 Brita filter cleans 40 gallons of water.Sure, a cup of water doesn't taste like a cold Coke, and sometimes you need that drink. But it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of your diet. Make the bulk of your fluid consumption water and have soda as an occasional treat.No. 4: Watch the adsGrocery stores do a great job of letting you know when they have sales. Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No email address was supplied by.

But knowing exactly what nutrients and how much they need of each is not always easy. Learning a bit more about vitamins and minerals can help ensure your kids are on the right nutritional track.Despite parents’ best efforts, kids may not always get all the vitamins and minerals they need. For example, a 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia found that more than half of children and adolescents who are otherwise healthy could be lacking invitamin D. This deficiency affects the absorption ofcalciumand can lead to unhealthybones, rickets, and even osteoporosis. The study looked at children between ages 6 and 21 and their dietary intake and body mass. The research revealed that 55 percent of children had an inadequate amount of vitamin D.To make sure your kids are getting the full range of nutrients that they need, be sure to offer your children a variety of foods. Start by taking a closer look at the foods your kids eat on a regular basis.Thenutritionlabels on food packaging can show you which foods contain the proper nutrients. Below is a breakdown of the essential vitamins and minerals that kids and teens need for different areas of growth and where to find them:Vitamin B helps the body produce red blood cells and assists in metabolicactivities. Vitamin B is found in meat, poultry, fish, soy, milk, eggs, whole grains, and enriched breads and cereals.Because the body cannot naturally produce all the necessary vitamins and minerals, it is important to ensure that kids get these vital building blocks in the foods they eat. A well-balanced diet is typically all it takes to guarantee that kids and teens are getting the necessary vitamins and minerals. But how much of everything do they need?The USDA recommends that parents useMy Pyramidfor children as a guideline for how much of certain foods kids and adolescents need for a healthy diet, taking vitamins and minerals into consideration. Because vitamin deficiencies may not be obvious, following the recommendations can help eliminate worries about whether your children are receiving appropriate nutrients.For children and teens with highly selective diets, such as vegetarianism or a dairy-free diet, and for children with erratic eating patterns, a health care provider may recommend a dailysupplement, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. Over-the-counter vitamin supplements are typically safe and come in chewable forms in case your child has difficulty swallowing. Remember, however, that higher-than-­recommended dosages of supplements can cause problems. For example, giving high doses of vitamin C in hopes of preventing colds and theflucan cause a child to have nausea, diarrhea, and cramps.Children’s vitamins and supplements may come in fun colors and shapes, but they are not candy. Make sure you’ve told your child that vitamins are a kind of medicine -- not a snack. Follow label instructions about serving size and dosage instructions. Ask you health care provider for advice if you have questions about supplements. Keep vitamins and supplements out of the reach of children and make sure the items are stored in child-proof containers.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/kids-need-their-nutrientsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Marks,Pure MattersStart by staying physically active, says Gary J. Kennedy, M.D., past president of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. "The rule of thumb is that a senior needs about a half hour of exercise every day," he says.That doesn't mean you have to take up jogging or head for the basketball court. Exercise can be as simple as a half-hour walk on most days of the week at a pace that lets you carry on a conversation and not get out of breath. Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that's right for you. Then make it part of your daily routine, Dr. Kennedy says.Even if you're living with a disability, Dr. Kennedy says, you can stay active. Try range-of-motion calisthenics, for instance.If it's icy or frigid outside, you can work out indoors, he says. If it's not icy, you can dress warmly and head outside.Physical activity isn't just good for your body. Research shows that regular aerobic activity -- the kind that raises yourheartrate -- can reduce or prevent symptoms ofdepressionandanxiety, says psychologist Kathy Hogan Bruen, Ph.D., senior director ofpreventionfor the National Mental Health Association.Dr. Kennedy suggests other ways that seniors can focus on "successful aging" in any season:Don't let winter take a bite out of your diet: Pay attention tonutrition, especially to getting enough fruits and vegetables. You can find a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables year round at the supermarket, or buy frozen fruits and vegetables to have them on hand if the weather turns bad and you can't get to the store.Also, be sure you're getting enoughcalciumandvitamin D, available assupplementsor in fortified, ready-to-eat cereals. Omega-3 fatty acids may help your heart health, so be sure your diet includes a little bit of fish, nuts (specificallywalnuts), andsoybeans, says Susan Moores, R.D., a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.If you'd like to learn more about good nutrition, sign up for a class at a local hospital or through a community education program. Have a meal with friends, says Moores.

Find out here.<COL>iStock ImageByMayo Clinic News NetworkAmalgam fillings are safe. A great deal of research has examined these fillings and found them to be an effective, long-lasting treatment for dental decay.Amalgam, or silver, fillings are made with mercury, silver, tin and copper. In some cases, other metals may be included in amalgam fillings, too. Amalgam has been used for many years to replace decayed areas within teeth. It is an excellent material for this purpose. Amalgam is a strong, stable substance that holds up well when placed in a moist environment. It is also a good choice because it can tolerate the dramatic changes in temperature within your mouth.We use amalgam fillings regularly at Mayo Clinic. They are best suited for larger fillings, such as those in molar teeth, as amalgam is a much more durable material than the material used in composite fillings. Composite resin fillings are made from plastic mixed with powdered glass to make them stronger.Some people prefer composite resin fillings because they are white. This enables them to blend in with your teeth and have a more natural look than the silver amalgam fillings. However, composite fillings tend not to last as long as amalgam fillings, particularly in children. They also are more expensive.Concerns have been raised over the years about the mercury in amalgam fillings. Mercury is an important component in the fillings because it effectively binds the other metals together, forming a strong bond that contributes to the filling's durability. It is important to note that there are several kinds of mercury. The mercury found in water that can build up in fish and lead to health problems if you ingest too much is not the same type of mercury used in amalgam. The mercury in amalgam is contained, or sequestered, within the filling.A variety of research studies have shown that the levels of mercury in people who have amalgam fillings are well below the point at which mercury may cause health problems. That was found to be true even in those who had multiple amalgam fillings, some with as many as 15 fillings. No evidence exists that shows amalgam fillings increase the risk for health problems. So unless you are having trouble with your fillings or experience an allergic reaction to the material in amalgam fillings, there is no need to have them replaced.It is possible that over long periods of time, usually several decades or more, amalgam fillings may not hold their original shape. If the fillings become deformed, then they need to be replaced. They also should be replaced if they start to break down over time.The bottom line is that there is no need for concern about the safety of amalgam fillings. There is no evidence that shows any correlation between having amalgam fillings and increased risks for illness or developmental problems. Amalgam is an excellent, long-lasting material for fillings. If you have concerns about your fillings, or if you experience problems with them, talk to your dentist about the need for replacement.— Thomas Salinas, D.D.S., Dental Specialties, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.Source: http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/amalgam-is-a-safe-and-durable-choice-for-fillingsNo email address was supplied by.

The state argues the decision improperly upholds rules enforcing federal subsistence fishing rights on navigable rivers that otherwise would be owned and managed by the state.Attorney General Michael Geraghty told the Anchorage Daily News the state got title to navigable rivers at statehood.

Body fat doubles over the five decades from age 25 to age 75. Body weight increases until you reach age 60, when it begins to decline.Less lean body mass needs fewer calories to maintain, and a more sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies aging also requires fewer calories. Because of these reasons, daily caloric needs fall by about 20 percent from age 30 to age 80.If you continue to eat the same amount of food that you did when younger, you will gain weight.The most effective method for losing weight is familiar: Exercise toburncalories and to build and maintain muscle, and/or limit the intake of calories.Health experts suggest to prevent weight gain you get at least 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity, intense enough to make you breathe harder, on most days of the week and 60 to 90 minutes per day forweight lossand maintaining weight loss. You don’t have to get all the exercise at one time, 10 minutes of activity at a time is fine. Just make sure your exercise sessions add up to the total recommended minutes on most days. This can be achieved with activities such as walking, gardening, dancing and even cleaning the house or car. Activities such as walking, biking and swimming are good for burning calories.Exercise, particularly strength-training routines that require you to lift or push weights, done two to three times a week, replace fat with muscle. This is important because muscle burns more calories than fat does. Balance and flexibility (stretching) exercises are also important because they help prevent falls.When thinking about how to change your eating habits, remember that one pound of body weight contains about 3,500 Calories. To lose a pound a week, you would need to cut back on your calories by about 500 calories a day.A balanced diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains can be particularly beneficial for people trying to lose weight. The U. S. Department of Agriculture recommends the following for healthy people:As you age, your sense of thirst diminishes. Because you may not feel thirsty, you may forget to drink water, which can lead to mild dehydration. Afeveror other illness, or hot weather, can lead to severe dehydration. To prevent dehydration, drink water regularly, even if you don't feel thirsty.Remember to talk with your health care provider before starting any newfitnessor weight-loss plan.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/weight-loss/for-seniors-how-about-losing-weight-todayDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such asheart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating morefiberand lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number youburnoff in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such asdepression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems withpregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, andinfluenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to theageof 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.For people older than 60, the vaccine Zostavax was licensed by the FDA in 2006 to prevent shingles. Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chicken pox. After an attack of chicken pox, the virus lies dormant in certain nerve tissue. As people age, it is possible for the virus to reappear in the form of shingles, which is estimated to affect two in every 10 people in their lifetime. Shingles is characterized by clusters of blisters, which develop on one side of the body. The blisters can cause severepainthat may last for weeks, months or years after the virus reappears. Studies showed that the vaccine reduced the occurrence of shingles between 50 and 64 percent.No email address was supplied by.

"There's nothing mysterious about taking preventive action; it's really just a matter of making healthy choices on a daily basis."Eating healthy foods in the right amounts can help you live a longer, healthier life.Many illnesses and conditions, such asheart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be prevented or controlled by eating a healthy, low-calorie, low-fat diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, says Ms. Trinité.Other dietary recommendations include eating morefiberand lean protein, such as chicken and fish, and less sodium, red meat and sugar.For specific information on how to improve your diet, ask your doctor and visit the National Cancer Institute's website, the American Heart Association's website or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans website.Being overweight increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure. To stay at a healthy weight, you need to balance the number of calories you eat with the number youburnoff in physical activity. You can reach a healthy weight and stay there by eating right and being physically active. Your health care provider can tell you what you should weigh for your height. Or you can calculate your body mass index (BMI), which should be 18.5 to 24.9 for optimal health. To calculate your BMI, first multiply your height in inches by your height in inches; use this result to divide your weight in pounds. Multiply this number by 703.Physical activity can help prevent heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and mental health problems, such asdepression."All kinds of physical activity, whether it's moderate or vigorous, will help you stay healthy," say Ms. Trinité. "It's a good idea to aim for at least moderate activity, such as brisk walking, bike riding, housecleaning, or playing with your children, for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Generally, the more active you are, the better you'll feel today and the healthier you'll become tomorrow."If you've been sedentary, smoke or have a chronic health condition, ask your health care provider how you should get started with an exercise program.More than 440,000 Americans die each year from smoking and smoking-related causes. Smoking causes illnesses such as cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke and problems withpregnancy."Quitting is hard, and most people try several times before they quit for good," says Ms. Trinité. "But when you're ready to quit, ask your doctor for advice on the best way for you."Always be sure you know important information about a medicine before you take it. This will help you get the full benefit of the drug. It also will help you avoid taking too much or too little, which can be dangerous.Each prescription medication comes with an information sheet. Be sure to carefully read this sheet. If you have questions or aren't clear about anything on the sheet, check with your health care provider, nurse or pharmacist.You can prevent several serious diseases by getting immunized. Check with your health care provider to be sure you've had immunization for measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, andinfluenza. If you are at risk for hepatitis A or B, you should be immunized against them. People older than 65 should be immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia.Because of a resurgence of whooping cough (pertussis) in adults, a booster shot in combination with diphtheria and tetanus is now available for teens and adults. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new vaccines as adult boosters for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. These vaccines are designated as Tdap and are recommended at 10-year intervals for people up to theageof 64. Current recommendations for adults 65 and older are to get boosters of tetanus and diphtheria only, every 10 years.In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second varicella (chicken pox) vaccine immunization for adults previously immunized against chicken pox. All adults not previously immunized and who have not had chicken pox should talk to their doctor about immunization.For people older than 60, the vaccine Zostavax was licensed by the FDA in 2006 to prevent shingles. Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chicken pox. After an attack of chicken pox, the virus lies dormant in certain nerve tissue. As people age, it is possible for the virus to reappear in the form of shingles, which is estimated to affect two in every 10 people in their lifetime. Shingles is characterized by clusters of blisters, which develop on one side of the body. The blisters can cause severepainthat may last for weeks, months or years after the virus reappears. Studies showed that the vaccine reduced the occurrence of shingles between 50 and 64 percent.No email address was supplied by.

You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.<COL>iStock/YinYangMost people have two similar goals -- to save more money and lose more weight.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap. If you want another layer of protection, use a water filter. A $7 Brita filter cleans 40 gallons of water.Sure, a cup of water doesn't taste like a cold Coke, and sometimes you need that drink. But it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of your diet. Make the bulk of your fluid consumption water and have soda as an occasional treat.No. 4: Watch the adsGrocery stores do a great job of letting you know when they have sales. Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No. 2: Buy frozen fruits, vegetablesNo email address was supplied by.

It also means outdoor adventures, and in Alaska's wild, certain practices are a must for fun and safety for everyone.<COL>Marcules E/Creative CommonsIn Alaska, summer is a chance to explore the great outdoors. For lifetime residents or people who have just arrived, taking a few precautions can keep outdoor adventures fun for everyone, and may even save a life.Fire SafetyAlready, fire officials in the state predict an "above normal" wildfire danger this summer. This is due to a warm spring and thin snow pack. Many areas are also seeing an early melt-off, which is creating drier foliage ripe for ignition.The Division of Forestry's web pagehas several resources available for determining if your excursion will be in a fire danger zone, and how to prevent wildland fires.The Alaska Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation also has several resources for campers, hikers, and wildlife observers. Trail maps, cabin rentals, and boating safety information are available, as well as a Glen Alps trailhead webcam.A list of trailsopen for pedestrian use only is now online, and nearly all trails are closed to ATVs and snowmachines for the season.WildlifeBear safety is also being emphasized as more and more people take to the trails. Encounters with bears rarely involve aggressive attacks, officials say, but outdoor enthusiasts should stillbrush up on what to do when confronted by a bear. Also important, officials note, is caution when approaching any wild animals, even the smallest and cutest.Alaska Fish and Game has compiled "Signs of Alarm"for animals of all shapes and sizes, and how to remove yourself safely from the situation if facing a wild animal.Local PlantsThey might not have teeth, but that doesn’t mean plants are harmless. The Alaska Public Lands Information Centers have put togethera list of plants pets and their humans should avoid. Many of Alaska's flowers and greenery are beautiful to behold, but dangerous to touch or consume. Alist of safe-to-eat berries and where to find themis also available.MudflatsA unique feature to Alaska is the length ofdeceptively solid-looking mudflatsalong the coast. When the tide goes out, the upper silt layer looks perfect for walking on, but many park officials and community members warn against treading out past firm land or rocks. Many have been trapped in the silt and are unable to pull themselves out due to the suction phenomenon that occurs with wet silt. As the tide begins to come in, rescue workers often worry about thepossibility of drowning and hypothermia from the cold water.Getting AroundWhatever your plans are this summer, getting there may also require a little extra precaution. Pedestrians, bikers, and inattentive sightseers will be out in full numbers, and being aware of them and your surroundings could save a life. Always practice correct traffic procedures when driving, and keep careful watch whenever you near a crosswalk, bike lane, or observation point.Alaska’s in-town trails are always improving, and in the last few years, construction of new paths has given pedestrians safer ways to get their destination or enjoy the fresh Alaska air. Many highway overpasses and busy intersections throughout Anchorage can be safely crossed by utilizing the “underpasses” or tunnels and the overhead walkways. If one of these is not available, increased traffic can create dangerous situations for pedestrians if crosswalks are not used. On average, the pedestrian walk signal lights up every 30-60 seconds, even at the busiest intersections, allowing walkers and bikers to get to their destination in a timely manner.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Yes, a normal life will resume with less doctor visits and treatments, yet the questions will continue. Questions that now relate to being healthy and staying healthy.After my chemotherapy ended, I was able to take an IV drug calledHerceptin. This drug was bio-engineered by Dr. Solomon from Calif. If a breast cancer patient was Her 2 Nu positive, they are a candidate for Herceptin. The trial for Herceptin ended five months early due to a 75 percent reduction rate in metastasis. Typically, researchers get excited about a 2-3 percent reduction rate in metastasis. My oncologist was one of the doctors involved in the trial; therefore, I was able to begin Herceptin a couple of months post chemo, which was five months before the drug was released to the public. Herceptin is a one year IV treatment with very minimal side effects. The major side effect from Herceptin is a runny nose.I also had lymph nodes removed in my left arm and needed to be fitted for a lymphedema sleeve. These sleeves are crucial to use on an airplane. These sleeves help to regulate drainage through the lymphatic system. It is very important to get the sleeve custom fitted to your arm. I found it helpful to learn some lymphedema massage techniques. I was very conscious not to lift heavy objects in my left arm including my kids.Life began to feel normal: less doctor visits and more hair growth. I feel that being mindful, letting go of what I can’t control and accepting my best efforts at accomplishing my goals keeps me healthy. Iworkout regularly, I try toeat a clean dietwith healthy oils and fats and I keep my regiment of vitamins and supplements.When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors. To overcome these multiple deficiencies, I changed my diet and included supplements to help strengthen my immune system. Some supplements that build up the immune system and enable the body’s own cells to destroy cancer cells are the following: IP6, flor-essence,anti-oxidants,vitamins, mineral and EFA’s (essential fatty acid found in fish oil). There is some basic information related to breast cancer that I try to remind myself of constantly. For instance, cancer cells feed on several different things. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Table salt has a chemical added to make it whiter in color. A better alternative, I find, is sea salt.I look forward to reading your story and how you managed to navigate through breast cancer and beyond…–Jessica LilienfieldDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Marable , Contributing writerWorried about overeating during the holiday? While this is a common concern, you don't have to give in to negative thinking and start planning your post-holiday diet. There are a few effective strategies that you can use to enjoy a guilt-free holiday dinner without gaining a single pound.Find an Accountability PartnerAn accountability partner can be an invaluable source of support and encouragement when trying to manage one's weight. The results of a study at Harvard Medical School and the University of California-San Diego revealed that people have a tremendous amount of influence on one another when it comes to weight loss and gain.An accountability partner can be a friend, coworker or family member, as long as he or she helps you stick to your goals. A true accountability partner will never suggest that you postpone healthy eating -- not even for one meal. And it does not necessarily matter if the person is not physically present for your holiday dinner; a brief phone conversation with them before you sit down to eat can help reinforce your weight management goals and keep you focused.Practice Visualization and Positive Self-TalkInstead of succumbing to self-defeating thoughts such as, "I'll diet after the holidays," or "this one time won't hurt," try verbally reaffirming your weight management goals and visualizing yourself achieving them. Recommended by a number of doctors, visualization has been used effectively by persons who once struggled with food cravings and a lack of motivation to exercise.Practice visualizing your desired outcome -- enjoying a healthy dinner and looking and feeling your best -- until it becomes a habit.Eat a Healthy Breakfast and 'Minimeals'It is fairly common for people to "save their appetite" for the big holiday dinner by not eating breakfast or lunch.This is a huge mistake. Depriving yourself of food until the main meal only increases the likelihood that you will be starving by the time you sit down to eat. The end result could very well be overeating. On the contrary, individuals who eat a healthy breakfast such as cereal with low-fat or skim milk and fruit, have been found to lose weight and keep it off successfully at much higher rates than those who skip breakfast.Studies also show that people who eat at least four small meals, or "minimeals," per day are significantly less likely to be obese than those who do not.Fill Up on Low-Energy Density FoodsIf you're fearful that eating tiny portions at your holiday dinner will leave you feeling hungry and frustrated, there is another, more realistic option: filling up on foods with low energy density. According to the Mayo Clinic, there are both high- and low-energy density foods, which the body digests differently. With high-energy density foods, one can accumulate calories very quickly from modest portions.These are foods that are high in fat and sugar. However, low-energy density foods such as leafy vegetables, beans, fruits, whole grains, fish and skinless poultry, can be eaten in larger quantities and result in fewer calories being consumed. So go ahead and eat until you are satisfied, but make wise food selections.Don't Place Food on DisplayIt is tradition in many households to set food out on the table in bowls and on platters when it's time to serve dinner. This is a no-no for persons who struggle with overeating, according to Auburn University Professor and nutritionist Barb Struempler. Leaving food out on the table only increases the likelihood of going back for seconds, even when you are no longer hungry. Struempler recommends that you serve plates from the stove and put food out of sight immediately after dinner has ended.The most important thing is to have a plan and stick with it. By incorporating some of the aforementioned strategies into your daily life prior to the holidays, you'll be more likely to make wiser decisions at the dinner table when the big day arrives.Copyright Internet Broadcasting.

Body fat doubles over the five decades from age 25 to age 75. Body weight increases until you reach age 60, when it begins to decline.Less lean body mass needs fewer calories to maintain, and a more sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies aging also requires fewer calories. Because of these reasons, daily caloric needs fall by about 20 percent from age 30 to age 80.If you continue to eat the same amount of food that you did when younger, you will gain weight.The most effective method for losing weight is familiar: Exercise toburncalories and to build and maintain muscle, and/or limit the intake of calories.Health experts suggest to prevent weight gain you get at least 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity, intense enough to make you breathe harder, on most days of the week and 60 to 90 minutes per day forweight lossand maintaining weight loss. You don’t have to get all the exercise at one time, 10 minutes of activity at a time is fine. Just make sure your exercise sessions add up to the total recommended minutes on most days. This can be achieved with activities such as walking, gardening, dancing and even cleaning the house or car. Activities such as walking, biking and swimming are good for burning calories.Exercise, particularly strength-training routines that require you to lift or push weights, done two to three times a week, replace fat with muscle. This is important because muscle burns more calories than fat does. Balance and flexibility (stretching) exercises are also important because they help prevent falls.When thinking about how to change your eating habits, remember that one pound of body weight contains about 3,500 Calories. To lose a pound a week, you would need to cut back on your calories by about 500 calories a day.A balanced diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains can be particularly beneficial for people trying to lose weight. The U. S. Department of Agriculture recommends the following for healthy people:As you age, your sense of thirst diminishes. Because you may not feel thirsty, you may forget to drink water, which can lead to mild dehydration. Afeveror other illness, or hot weather, can lead to severe dehydration. To prevent dehydration, drink water regularly, even if you don't feel thirsty.Remember to talk with your health care provider before starting any newfitnessor weight-loss plan.Source:http://resources.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/weight-loss/for-seniors-how-about-losing-weight-todayDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

These lists usually include things like spinach, lettuce, and kale,all of which are in fact easy and tasty to grow, but who says your garden, and your plates, have to be like everyone else's? We rounded up some fun spring vegetables that don't present a huge challenge to gardeners, yet aren't necessarily grown as often, for you to check out this year.Orach, also called purple orach, is a spinach relative that has the same spicy, great flavor, but it has bright purple leaves. It looks great in the garden and you can use it in salads and all the same dishes you'd use spinach in. For extra fun, try growing orach microgreens and adding them to salads and main dishes like fish. (Microgreens are just greens that you've sprouted, allowed to grow for a week or so, and then harvested.)Purple tree collardsproduce flavorful purple leaves that you can harvest at will. These veggies grow best in areas with a Mediterranean climate, and they make a striking addition to the garden. Better yet, they're perennial, so once you get them going, you won't have to fuss with them anymore. Since they grow from cuttings, you can ask a fellow gardener for a start or pick one up at a nursery.Arugulahas gotten popular in recent years, thanks in no small part to the President's love for this spicy mustard relative. It's super-easy to grow. We recommend planting in waves, spaced about a week or two apart, so that you have a steady supply of it. Like the other easy spring veggies, it's a cinch to grow, although arugula can start to bolt and go bitter very quickly in warm weather.Bok choyis delicious in stir fries and more, and it's also extremely easy to grow. As with arugula, you can grow it in waves in order to have a steady supply of baby as well as older plants for different cooking projects, providing access to the full range of delicious flavors this tasty plant offers. It can also tend to be a bolter, which is why growing in the cool season of early spring is ideal!Carrotsare also easy growers, and they love spring weather. You don't have to settle for run of the mill orange, either: these roots come in shades ranging from purple to yellow, including carrots designed for fresh raw eating as well as cooking carrots. Get some seedlings started and you'll have lovely additions to salads in no time flat.Mizunais a fantastic green with lacy fern-like leaves and contrasting white ribs. It's fantastic in salads, but can be used like other greens in a variety of settings, where its slightly spicy flavor adds a note of sophistication. Be aware that it wilts very quickly after harvesting, so it's best used immediately after picking, or stored in a jar of water to keep it in good condition.Why not make yourspring landscapinga little more fun with these plants, especially since many can be used in edible landscaping as well as serving as delicious, nutritious crops? For extra credit, hire a localPhoenix handymanto help you build some raised beds at different levels to give your garden some added depth and texture.Source: http://www.networx.com/article/6-fun-and-unusual-spring-veggies-to-grNo email address was supplied by.

The Associated Press says his presence in Alaska can be tracked back to a nonresident sport fishing license he was issued in 2003.According to a Thursday AST dispatch, troopers responded to the home of suspect Paul Vermillion, 30, after he called Soldotna troopers at about 2 a.m. Thursday.“(Vermillion) stated that there had been an altercation at his  residence off of Snug Harbor road in Cooper Landing, and an adult male was deceased,” troopers wrote. “Based upon initial observation and evidence obtained at the scene, it appears that (Muskox) suffered a gunshot wound that may have contributed to his death.”Muskox's body has been sent to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage for an autopsy. Both AST and the Alaska Bureau of Investigation are working on the case.AST spokesperson Megan Peters was taking questions from the media Thursday afternoon but refused to immediately discuss the case any further, citing the pending nature of the investigation.“I don’t know when we will be answering those questions,” Peters said.Vermillion was taken to the Wildwood Pretrial Facility in Kenai.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The full event was held at the Carlson Center in Fairbanks, a venue that can hold over 6,500 people.The ceremony began after the casket for Rich was brought in, preceded by the Seattle Police Pipe and Drum Corps, and placed on stage near Sgt. Johnson’s urn. Several friends and close family members of both men spoke of their bravery and goodness, even Sgt. Johnson’s oldest daughter, Haley.UAA Police Officer Sean McGee recalled the many years leading up to Johnson’s “inevitable career in Alaska law enforcement” that included work at two Oregon law enforcement agencies, and several years of wrestling in school.“In second grade, he told his parents he was going to be an Alaska State Trooper,” McGee said. “A goal from which he never wavered.”Keith Mallard, a close friend of Johnson’s, wept openly at the podium as he said his final goodbye.“Scott and Gabe represented what was right in this world. He and Gabe stood at the gates of our community,” Mallard said. “The only solace I find in this is that my brother [Scott] was there with my new brother Gabe, and so none of them will ever be alone.”Sgt. Johnson and Rich were killed in the line of duty on May 1, when they were shot from behind by the son of a man they were attempting to arrest. At his initial charging hearing, 19-year-old Nathanial Kangas was given the opportunity to speak, and simply stated “I’m sorry,” a phrase that seemed to offend some rather than appease.“His sorry means nothing,” said one fellow K-9 officer at the memorial. “And is downright offensive.”Kangas’ mother also apologized at the hearing to those law enforcement officers present.Sgt. Johnson is survived by his wife Brandy and their three daughters, while Rich leaves behind his fiancé Angie Taylor and their two children.Taylor spoke briefly on stage, reading aloud a poignant letter she had written to her fallen trooper. Her father-in-law stood beside her, head bowed.“I carry your heart,” Taylor read. “I carry it in my heart.”Taylor and Rich were set to wed this summer, shortly after Rich was to become a Fish and Wildlife officer in July, according to Dusty Johnson, a friend and fellow law enforcement officer. He recalled several occasions when Rich was able to diffuse dangerous situations with people with his charm and infectious smile, talking to them as a friend.Both men werehonoredwith a 21 gun salute and taps, and escorted out of the arena by several members of local law enforcement after their flags were presented to each of their families.Amemorial page was set up on Facebook the day after the shooting, and those interested in offering financial and emotional support to the families can do so by purchasing a“Gone but Not Forgotten” t-shirt, from which all of the proceeds will go to the troopers’ families.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Find out how to monitor it and improve your levels.<COL>iStockGround beef -- Nearly 2 million pounds of ground beef has been recalled in four states over E. coli fears. Recalled cases of beef from Wolverine Packing Company in Detroit were shipped to distributors for restaurant use in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.ByPure MattersBefore you become overwhelmed by the pumpkins and candy corn already overflowing at your local grocery store, it’s important to bring up something even scarier than most Halloween movies–high cholesterol. September isNational Cholesterol Education Monthand a great excuse to brush up on some information,health tests, and diet reassessments as we gear up for the coming months of candy, turkey, and cookies shaped like little men.Now you may be saying, “hey, not all cholesterol is bad,” and you’re right, it isn’t. High Density Lipoprotein, also known as HDL, is “good cholesterol,” which is known for taking bad cholesterol out of the blood and keeping it from building up in your arteries. Ideal HDL levels for both men and women is 60 mg/dL and above and has been shown to help lower one’s risk for heart disease. Low levels range around 50 and under for women and 40 and under for men.Last year, I had a whole host of blood work done as part of a “I’m not getting any younger and should probably start seeing a doctor” sort of thing. When they did my cholesterol tests they found that my HDL levels were high, which was great to hear. But, they also found my LDL, or Low Density Lipoprotein, was high too -- WHAT?!?LDL is the bad cholesterol. It’s called that because it’s a waxy plaque that builds up on the insides of your arteries and slows blood flow to the brain and heart, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. Basically,LDL sucks.At the time I was 23 and only two years removed from being a Division I athlete in college. While I admit a few pounds had found their way to my midsection since I’d hung up the spandex and oar, I was still under the delusion that I was years away from having to worry about that kind of stuff. The results were an eye opener and have since planted that little annoying voice in the back of my head that won’t shut up every time I even consider reaching for a peanut butter cup. I bring this up because I think it speaks volumes to the level of awareness people have for what goes on in our bodies. Just because we look “healthy” doesn’t guarantee that our insides are and that goes especially for young people just crossing the double decade line.Since receiving these results, I’ve been trying to take steps, albeit sometimes little ones, towards undoing some of the damage caused during my years of naïveté. Having a burrito for lunch every day or eating red meat five nights a week isn’t okay any more (not that it ever was), but back then I could burn it all off before my bedtime snack. Now it’s all about healthy choices and compromise. High fiber, low fat foods areessential in reducing LDLand increasing HDL. Things like vegetables, nuts, fish, and whole grains are perfect for this in addition to exercising regularly and not smoking.At this very moment, more than 102 million Americans age 20 and older have high cholesterol. It’s severely important to get tested now to dictate how you can take action and ensure a better and healthier life down the road. Knowledge is power, and in this case, a life saver.–Tom CarusoSource:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/why-you-need-to-keep-an-eye-on-cholesterol-no-matter-how-young-you-are-guest-post#more-2308Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"Based on straight-line cuts visible around the eye, we believe it was removed by a fisherman and discarded."A beachgoer found the eyeball while taking a stroll along Pompano Beach north of Fort Lauderdale.The discovery -- and resulting photo -- went viral online and caused a buzz in the marine biology community, according to The Associated Press."Any time something weird and crazy washes up on the beach, it's definitely interesting," Heather Bracken-Grissom, an assistant marine science professor at Florida International University in Miami, told the AP.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

We’re also told to visit our GYN for annual checkups so the doctor, among other things, could perform a thorough breast exam and note any changes from the past year. Throughout my adult years, performing a monthly breast exam was a ritual for me, especially since my mother and grandmother were both breast cancer survivors.  At age 34, I did in fact, discover a lump. And yes, I waited a few months to see the doctor because in the life of a busy mom with daughters ages 2 and 6, I put myself last!I finally made it to the doctor’s three months later. Due to my family history ofbreast cancer, the doctor ordered a mammogram and sonogram. The report came back clear. I was so incredibly relieved! It had been a very stressful week waiting for the results. However, the turning point in my life would be four months later.The months following my mammogram, I was still completely aware of the lump: same size, same place, same hardness. I wasn’t alarmed because the radiologist stated it was a clean report. Four months after that mammogram, I visited my GYN for a simple birth control pill re-evaluation. I remember telling the doctor that I still felt that lump, no change in shape or size, but it was still there! My doctor read the report out loud, “No mass seen, repeat mammogram in one year.” I was again relieved to hear the clean report findings. However, I begged him to do another breast exam. The doctor performed the exam and without hesitation, ordered me to see a breast surgeon immediately. His office scheduled me to see a breast surgeon that day. I did not have time to research doctors or call friends for referrals.I walked to the surgeon’s office later that day ... films in hand and in a complete daze. The surgeon viewed the mammogram film first. She stated there were clear visible calcifications in my left breast and she saw the tumor that I had been feeling for the last 9 months. She told me two areas on my left breast should have been biopsied immediately following the mammogram. I could see the doctor’s lips moving, but I could no longer hear her words. As I lay upon the table, I felt the ceiling slowly moving towards me. My chest began to feel very heavy as I realized my life would never be the same.Naturally, I wanted a second opinion. It came from a surgeon who was chief of surgery at a nearby hospital. He, too, stated the exact same information after examining my films. However, this time, I began to feel empowered. It was through my own self-awareness and advocating for my breast exam that I, hopefully, caught the potential cancer early.I knew that if I, too, had to battlebreast cancerthen I had an amazing role model, my mother.  My mother always said she was a warrior to breast cancer, not a survivor of breast cancer. She was very diligent about taking supplements and vitamins fromfish oiltogarlic supplementsto high-potencyVitamin C. The doctors gave her approximately four years to live after her breast cancer metastasized to her bone. I believe she was able to prolong her life mainly because she was so diligent with the vitamins and supplements she took on a daily basis.Within a week I was scheduled for a biopsy. I never needed another mammogram, sonogram or a MRI.  It was now the dreaded biopsy day. As I lay on the table face down, ready to be marked by the surgeon, I looked at the monitor. The mammogram that the radiologist misread four months earlier was displayed on the surgeon’s monitor. I was angry and relieved all at the same time. I was angry that my mammogram was misread but relieved I advocated for myself to have the breast exam repeated within four months. I would now have to wait one week to get the results of the pathology report.Self-awareness and self-advocacy is so important for all of us. We need to remember to perform breast self-exams and take action quickly if we suspect something.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/prevention/my-personal-account-of-breast-cancer-part-1-self-awareness-and-self-advocacyDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

As weage, our bodies and metabolism change. Although older adults still need plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, andfiber, they need to add or subtract a few things from the diet they followed earlier in life.Many older adults have a decreased sense of taste and decreased absorption. They need to make sure they get enough water and nutrients, even if they must takesupplementsto get them.Although we all should drink eight glasses of water a day, it's critical for older adults to factor in water because they have decreasedkidneyfunction and may not feel thirsty.Adequate water intake helps avoid constipation. Older adults' digestive tracts don't work as effectively as they once did, making constipation more likely, and many older adults have dental problems that keep them from eating as much fiber as they need. Fiber also helps prevent constipation.Another possible addition to an older adult's diet is avitaminand mineral supplement. Older adults often don't get enoughcalciumorvitamin Din their diet, and a lack of either of those can lead to bone loss and osteoporosis. Vitamin B12is another nutrient that's often found lacking in older adults. As the body ages, it becomes less able to absorb B12from foods. B12is critical for healthy nerve and red blood cells. Vitamin B12supplements may be taken as a pill, an injection, or a gel applied to the inside of the nose.You should discuss the issue of supplements with your health care provider. Older adults already purchase more supplements than other age groups. Unfortunately, false advertising leads them to believe that supplements will stop or curb the aging process.Recent research indicates that many problems associated with the aging process can be slowed with a good diet. So the benefits associated with consuming a balanced, nutrient-rich diet are endless.One good way to find out what you need in daily nutrition is to visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website My Pyramid. The site asks for your age, gender, and level of physical activity to determine your daily caloric needs.My Pyramid, based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the USDA, encourages people to eat a suggested amount from five major food groups each day. If you can't do that, at least try to eat something from each group each day. Choose lower-fat foods and include vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.These are suggested amounts from the Dietary Guidelines:Other tips for good nutrition:Fruits and vegetables are a real plus for seniors, because they are lower in calories than other foods, yet high in nutrients, Fruit is much healthier for dessert than cookies or cake--yet many older adults indulge their sweet tooth with sugary treats rather than fresh fruit.Some older adults have trouble getting adequate nutrition because of health problems or financial difficulties. If these are problems that affect you, there are steps you can take to ease them.If you have trouble chewing, you might not be able to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, or meat. Instead, you might try the following ideas, from the FDA:If certain foods give you gas, try these alternatives:If you can't shop or cook for yourself, you can make other arrangements. Some groceries will deliver food at no charge; others charge a fee. A family member, friend, or church or synagogue group may be able to help with shopping. A senior citizen program in your area may deliver meals. You can use the microwave to cook already-prepared meals. You might consider moving to a place where meals are prepared for you -- either with a family member or a senior citizens' center. Eating with other people also is a good way to encourage your appetite; eating alone can be lonely.If money is a problem, here are some suggestions from the FDA:No email address was supplied by.

From hemp t-shirts to vegan soap to a myriad of organic superfoods, Earth-friendly products took over the Walter E Washington Convention Center. I know Pure Matters loves being eco-friendly and I thought our readers would enjoy checking out some of the green products that were promoted at this year’s Green Festival. Read on to get a peek at some of the green brands that were represented at the festival.Eco-Friendly Food and DrinksA handful of juice companies showed up at the Green Festival to share their organic drinks with the crowds.Raawpromoted tasty juices made from fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, preservatives, or artificial colors or flavors.Natural Zing, a raw, vegan, organic food distributor, distributed catalogues containing all their chocolates, nuts and seeds, dried fruits, and other healthy, eco-friendly snacks.MOMs organic markethanded out samples of some of their healthy, natural snacks -- if you haven’t shopped at MOMs, I recommend visiting one of their affordable, natural food stores. The animal rights organization, Compassion Over Killing (cok.net) offered free booklets of easy vegan recipes, which you can find online atwww.VegRecipes.org.Eco-Friendly Pet FoodSpring Naturalsbrought samples of their natural treats and dinners for dogs.

Roaming through the booths, listening to the various talks, and munching on delicious organic, natural foods is worth the small admission fee. I promise you’ll leave feeling excited to make at least one little change in your daily life that will positively impact on the planet.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/green-festival-highlights-eco-friendly-products-worth-tryingDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Then, you were late for work. And on your way home, the car had a flat tire, making you miss your daughter's softball game.Now you've got this throbbing headache that has gone from a minor annoyance to a major jackhammer pounding away in your skull.And this jackhammer crew keeps busy: An estimated 45 million Americans suffer from chronic headaches, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the American College of Physicians. In fact, for half that number, that poundingpainwill be severe and possibly disabling.For most of us, though, relief is as close as the medicine cabinet: About 90 percent of all headaches are harmless episodes that can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers—alone or together with rest, ice packs, or relaxation techniques.Most often, that pain is caused by one of two things:In general, headaches fall into three classes: tension, migraine, and cluster.The most common type of headache (accounting for about 90 percent) is the tension type. Some people describe them as a band of pressure or tightness around the head, at the back of the neck, or at the base of the skull. Some can last weeks, months -- even years.A lot ofstressfactors contribute to headaches, says the National Headache Foundation. The first step in controlling chronic headache pain is pinpointing the nature of its causes and symptoms.Unlike tension headaches, you can blame migraines on those temporary changes in the diameter of blood vessels serving the brain and scalp.While some people call any severe headache a migraine, the real thing is usually much more intense -- throbbing pain accompanied by nausea and even vomiting. Migraines can also bring visual changes and heightened sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells.Migraines affect more than 29.5 million Americans, who often inherit the affliction. Research has also shown ties to diet, stress, menstruation, and environmental changes.Cluster headaches bedevil about a million Americans, mostly men and mostly at night. Like migraines, cluster headaches follow changes in the brain's blood flow. Unlike migraines, they last less than an hour and occur in predictable "clusters," three- to eight-week periods in which they can strike several times a day.Cluster headaches produce extremely severe pain, incapacitating victims even more than migraines. But cluster headaches can enter long periods of remission.Doctors aren't sure what causes migraines or cluster headaches, but they've identified foods and food additives that can trigger a headache.Have you heard of "Chinese restaurant syndrome"? It's the headache some of us get after a favorite Chinese meal. It comes from the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), also found in some frozen foods, lunch meats, canned and dry soups, and many other processed foods.Then there's a class of chemicals called nitrites, used to preserve bacon, sausage, canned ham, smoked fish, and other meats. Nitrites can affect the body much the same way as low levels of serotonin-blood vessels in the brain dilate, sometimes producing a headache.And certain foods that contain tyramine, such as hard cheeses, peas, navy and lima beans, fresh bread,yogurt, alcoholic beverages, and chocolate, might trigger headaches -- especially in people who get migraines.The NINDS recommends preventive treatment if you experience three or more headaches every month. Ditto if your headaches are increasingly unresponsive to OTC medications.No email address was supplied by.

Get her tips on what to see and do in Ecuador.Ecuador is geographically plentiful.  Although it is only slightly larger than Colorado it can be divided into four different regions -- the coast, the Sierra (highlands), the Oriente (East, Amazon region) and the Galápagos Islands.Located in the Sierra on the slopes of Pichincha, an active volcano, sits the capital, Quito, at 9,350 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains.  The quaint colonial character has been preserved in the historical city center (Centro Histórico) while the rest of the city has grown to be a modern cosmopolitan city.Begin your visit to Quito by sight-seeing in Centro Histórico, where you can wind through the cobblestoned side streets leading to beautiful courtyards.  Make sure to visit the Palacio de Gobierno/Palacio Presidencial and La Catedral Metropolitana (Metropolitan Cathedral) in Plaza Grande (also referred to as Plaza de la Independencia), the Plaza of San Francisco, the Museo de Arte Colonial, Cerro Panecillo -- a hill that stands over the old city with a statue, the Virgin of the Americas, on top.As you wander the narrow streets make sure to stop and try different food along the way.  Taste a warm quimbolito, a traditional sweet of Ecuador wrapped in banana or canna leaves.  I was wary to try them at first, but after one bite I was hooked.Another treat that is a must to try is an humita.  Humitas are made from fresh ground up corn, cheese, sugar and cream, milk or butter depending on the recipe. Then they are steamed in a corn husk.  It is a long process to make humitas, but well worthwhile.Continue wandering through Quito by making your way to the TelefériQo, a gondola lift running up the East side of Pichincha Volcano.  It takes you to nearly 13,000 feet where you will be overwhelmed with beautiful views and high enough to touch clouds.Other attractions in Northern Quito include the Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa (stadium) where national and club fútbol (soccer) matches take place.  Across the street is Parque Carolina.  Quiteños (people from Quito) spend time playing soccer, volleyball and jogging in the park.  In many ways, the park is similar to Central Park in New York.You can see where bullfights take place during the Fiestas de Quito, a celebration for the foundation of Quito, at the Plaza de Torros.Traveling even farther North, you will reach la Mitad del Mundo -- or Middle of the World.  There is a line marking where the equator is – it is surreal to jump from one side of the hemisphere to the other.  There is also a museum dedicated to Ecuadorian culture.Tasting more Ecuadorian cuisine is a must.  Soup is called sopa, caldo or locro.  It is a major part of Serrano cuisine and is served before almost every lunch.  There are many different types of soups.  One soup that is particularly memorable is fanesca.  Fanesca is a rich soup served only during Holy Week, the week before Easter.  Nearly every imaginable ingredient goes into fanesca -- fish, eggs, cheese, corn and more.Ceviche, usually made from shrimp or fish, is also a popular dish.  It is served in a tomato/citrus based sauce with patacones, thick slices of double fried plantains, popcorn or tostada on the side.  People often enjoy it with a cold beer.On the weekends families and friends gather for a parillada (barbeque) where they will eat anything from chicken to cuy (guinea pig), a specialty in Ecuador, to fritada (fried pork) served with llapingachos (potato patties filled with cheese), potatoes or mote (corn that has been boiled, cooked and peeled.Enjoy the Ecuadorian culture and if time permits venture to the Amazon’s basin in the Oriente, the colorful markets in Otavalo, theplaya(beach) in Guayaquil or Esmeraldas or even the Galápagos Islands. Get ready to meet some of the friendliest people you will ever know and enjoy every moment while in Ecuador.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

What are the benefits to supplements?<COL>By Juliette,Pure MattersIt might be an odd question to come from a blog for a brand that makes their own line of supplements, but still, I think it’s one worth asking: really,why should you take vitamins, minerals and supplements?Growing up with fish oil practically pumping through my veins thanks to my integrative doctor mom, I know that making supplements a part of my healthy lifestyle is just as important as making sure I eat copious amounts of leafy greens each day. But with so many supplement options on the market and contradictory nutritional information in the media, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.So I turned toAmy Fitzpatrick, MS, RD, nutrition expert and dietitian with more than a decade of experience (and Pure Matters’ own Scientific Advisory Board member) to bust some common misconceptions about supplements and get the scoop on why they matter.Q: Can’t I get all of the nutrients I need in food?A: Research studies consistently show that the majority of Americans, young and old, do not consume the recommended daily amount of a wide variety of essential nutrients needed for optimal health. Supplements are a convenient way to help bridge the gap between what your diet provides and what your body demands. In addition, it can be difficult to achieve the recommended amount of some nutrients through diet alone. For example, vitamin D isn’t widely available in our food supply and the amount of omega-3 fats shown in clinical studies to provide a wide range of health benefits requires supplementation.Q: Do daily vitamins and supplements cancel out unhealthy eating habits and lack of exercise?A: No. Supplements aren’t a remedy or a cure-all for an unhealthy diet or sedentary lifestyle; they are intended to “supplement” a healthy lifestyle. In fact, the three key pillars of wellness are a healthy diet, regular physical activity and dietary supplementation.

"At approximately (9:57 p.m.) the homeowner at the same residence reported shooting at a bear which had surprised him in the driveway of the residence."Police and troopers, along with members of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, unsuccessfully tried to find the brown bear after the shots were fired.AST spokesperson Megan Peters didn't have word Tuesday on whether both incidents were believed to involve the same bear, or what kind of dog was eaten during the initial encounter. She says that with no sign of the bear fired upon -- or that it was wounded -- being found, there aren't plans for a more in-depth search."If it's there, it's there; if it's not, it's not," Peters said. "The basic rule of thumb is that we deal with the dead (bears) and Fish and Game deals with the live ones."Juneau-based Fish and Game spokespersons didn't immediately have further information on the incident as of early Tuesday evening.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The count of obstruction of justice carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to the AP.Mix had been charged with two counts of obstruction of justice. The Justice Department said he deleted text messages he had been ordered to save, including one that concluded the undersea gusher that erupted on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico was far worse than reported at the time.BP had assigned Mix to help estimate the size of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, ultimately calculated at nearly 5 million barrels of crude. Prosecutors said one of the messages investigators recovered from his phone included "real-time flow-rate analysis" during an effort to plug the damaged well -- data that contradicted the company's public statements about the ongoing disaster.The oil spill spewed nearly 5 million barrels of crude into the sea. The disaster began with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig that killed 11 workers.The spill damaged the region's fishing and tourism industries.

Follow these tips to try to repair it.<COL>By Kevin Stevens,NetworxDiscovering a broken tile in your home is always a bit of a bummer, even more so if you do not have any extra tiles left over from the original installation. When I complete a tile project for a client, I insist that he keep a few of the leftover tiles, just in case. If we do not have any left, I recommend ordering or buying a few right away, as they may not be available in 5 years or so, or you may not remember what style, part number or color was used down the line.Some tiles get cracked due to poor installation combined with normal wear and tear. Other tile damage is due to some type of accident. A 10-pound cast iron skillet falling a few feet can do serious damage to your tile.No email address was supplied by.

I could’ve been healthier but I think I deserve some bonus points for making an effort to consume fruits and vegetables at times when I just wanted to curl up in bed and hibernate between runs to the porcelain Goddess. I’ve also been extra careful about not eating all those things on that long list of no-no’s that my doctor gave to me. And I take my prenatal vitamins every day -- that counts for something, right?You’re probably wondering why you should listen to me abouteating healthywhile pregnant. Shouldn’t you be listening to someone with an A-plus average? Well, I happen to be a research junkie and, as usual, I’ve consumed a LOT ofpregnancybooks, magazine articles, and information from trustworthy healthcare organizations. So, even if I’m notfollowingthe perfect eating plan, the information I’m passing along is from truly trustworthy sources.The best motivation to eat healthy is the little guy or gal growing inside you. We want to give them the best chance at living long, healthy lives and that starts in the womb. When I’m craving something greasy and fried or sticky sweet, I think about the fact that my baby will also be ingesting this greasy, sugary item. When I stop to think about that, I often end up reaching for the salad, veggies, or fruit. Of course, there are the times that I do give in to the cravings, and it’s okay to do that once in a while. After all, at least ice cream helps me meet mycalciumquota!Your second best motivation is YOU. The better you eat, the better you’ll feel. I proved this to myself after a work-related trip where I said yes to WAY too many desserts and then endured a sleepless night of stomach cramps and severe nausea. Whether or not the desserts were purely to blame, I decided to take it easy on the sweets going forward and I haven’t had another night quite that bad. Being pregnant already has the potential to cause us various discomforts including nausea, exhaustion, dizziness, backaches, and headaches (should I go on?), so we really need to do our best to eat food that will help our bodies stay as strong and healthy as possible during this time.My favoritepregnancyrelated book is calledNine Months In, Nine Months Out, a reference guide written by expert moms. It talks about boosting your body’s healing capabilities by eating foods that contain certain vitamins and nutrients that help us prego gals keep the nausea at bay and increase energy while maintaining a calm mind. As a general rule, they recommend including the following in your daily diet during pregnancy:Everypregnancyis different; however, we should all strive to get the basic nutrients we need to make our little ones as healthy as possible. If you find yourself lacking motivation, just remind yourself of the baby you’re carrying and the fact that you’ll feel better the next day if you choose the right foods for your body. And, like I mentioned before, it’s okay to treat yourself to something not-so-healthy (within reason, NOT something on the no-no list, like raw fish) once in a while, just try to keep it balanced overall. And, of course, try to enjoy what you’re eating while pregnant, even the fruits and veggies. Mini-you will appreciate that too.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/how-to-stay-motivated-to-eat-healthy-while-pregnantDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Blood meal, bone meal, manure, fish emulsion, the list goes on and on. Animal parts can pop up in almost every phase of a standard growing season. So much so, that using them can almost seem unavoidable.But these days, a lot of people are choosing to grow their gardens without the addition of animal products, and for many different reasons: they may be vegan or have an ethical objection, they may have religious limitations, or they may have allergies, just to name a few. In water-strapped communities that are over-tapped bylocal plumbing demands, like San Diego, non-animal fertilizing practices like mulching can help to conserve water. So for those folks, here’s animal-friendly list. A handy dandy cheat sheet, if you will. Your options are as follows ...1. CompostCompost is the perfect plant food. It’s incredibly rich in myriad minerals, and it also provides important beneficial bacteria and other essential micro fauna. These organisms help to colonize the soil, keeping it “clean” and within a desirable pH range.You can make your own compost at home, using yard waste and kitchen scraps, or you can buy premade compost. Many brands offer animal-free options. Just look for boxes that are marked “vegan”.2. Liquid Herbal InfusionsMany of the most common plants, even some that are considered pests, can be full of important minerals such as nitrogen, iron, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. These “wonder weeds” include nettle, dandelion, oat straw, horse tail, and comfrey, to name a few.It’s easy to make a strong infusion from any of these, by chopping them up and allowing them to steep in a bucket of water in the sun. Once the brew is good and strong, it can be used to supplement your vegetables or fruit trees.3. SeaweedSea vegetables are an excellent source of trace minerals, like sodium, copper, zinc, and more. Many gardeners overlook the importance of these lesser minerals, because they’re so focused on the coveted trio, N-P-K. However, over time soil can become depleted of trace minerals, and plants can really begin to suffer.Seaweed is sold as liquid or meal (often labeled as kelp). There are many brands available, so check out your local nursery.4. Mulch With StrawMulching is a technique whereby the garden bed is covered with some sort of barrier – in this case straw – either over the winter or in order to prepare a new plot for planting. The benefit of mulching with straw is that the organic matter slowly breaks down and “feeds” the soil. Mulching also encourages worms to live underneath, and worms are the perfect ingredient for healthy, happy dirt.5. Nitrogen-Fixing CropsAlso called “green manure”, this is another technique that uses actual plants to create an organic fertilizer. The nitrogen-gathering plants are allowed to grow for just a short while, and then they’re tilled into the ground. The cover crops provide a protection from weeds, while turning them under returns the nitrogen to the soil. The most common crops used for green manure are wheat, oats, rye, vetch, clover, peas, and broad beans.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/animal-free-fertilizers-for-your-healthyDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Children, between uncovered sneezes and unwashed hands, quickly spread germs to classmates.<COL>iStock Image(NewsUSA) - Sniffles and sneezes, sore throats and coughs -- the return to school heralds cold and flu season's start. Children, between uncovered sneezes and unwashed hands, quickly spread germs to classmates.When cold season comes, it arrives with a vengeance. But parents can boost their children's overall health, helping young immune systems fight disease. Here are some tips for parents looking to escape flu season unscathed:- Keep children active. For many children, cold weather means couch-potato behavior. But from visiting pumpkin patches to ice skating, the fall and winter provide fun activities. Physically active children possess healthier immune systems, which help fight off infection. When it's too cold to play outside, consider indoor activities, like bowling or dancing.- Watch your kids' diets. A healthy diet keeps young immune systems strong. Make sure that children eat healthy meals that include vegetables, fruit, healthy protein and whole grains. A healthy breakfast before school keeps young minds sharp and provides immune-supporting nutrition. If children won't eat breakfast, offer milk or 100 percent fruit juice and a multivitamin.Even in children who don't skip meals, multivitamins fill nutritional gaps. Look for multivitamins without artificial preservatives or colors, like L'il Critters Immune C plus Zinc and Echinacea, which support healthy immune function and taste like regular gummy candies. L'il Critters Omega-3 Gummy Fish contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which improve concentration and help prevent disease.- Allow unstructured play. Among school, sports, music lessons and community organizations, children can feel stressed and tired. While structured activities have their benefits, too much stress leads to poorer immune function. Make sure children have time for imaginative play, and you will see fewer sniffles through the school year.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

They go, 'That's nice.' But you say, 'We're going to have a pool party with a gator.' They go, 'What?' Everybody comes," Barrett said.Customer Debbie Rubenstein told the TV station that she has used the service multiple times."Nobody believed that we'd have actual gators in the pool," she said.According to Barrett, the pool party idea came to him as a way to keep his handling business afloat during slow tourism months at his attraction.He told Bay News 9 that he checked area laws to see if bringing alligators with their mouths tapped shut to local homes was legal, and said he could not find any indication that it was not.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said it is investigating Barrett's business and its impact on the animals.There was no word on what Barrett charges to frolic with a man-eater.To read the original story,click here.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Doctors and medical professionals agree: a healthy diet includes one rich in omega-3 fatty acids and oils. And as Duffy MacKay, vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition points out, the studies didn’t test whether the participant’s diet was already high in fish oil or if they were already sick.Mackay also noted that Americans know they should be eating a diet high in fatty fish, but “the reality is that people are simply not doing this. Omega-3 supplements serve as an affordable, convenient and safe way to obtain omega-3 fatty acids and the array of health benefits they offer.”There have been countless research studies that show many benefits to taking a daily fish oil supplement. In a majority of the studies, fish oil supplementation was shown to lower triglyceride levels among other health advantages.

This is unusual behavior for Semrinec. Semrinec is new to Alaska and unfamiliar with the Anchorage area.”U.S. Army Alaska spokesperson Lt. Col. Alan Brown confirms that Semrinec is a soldier, but was still gathering details on the case Thursday evening.“We’re just getting details and getting the information,” Brown said.Myren says that while police know Semrinec left the Ramada Inn on 3rd Avenue in Downtown Anchorage, checking out at about 9 a.m. Monday, officers don’t have word that he got into or was driving a car.“I don’t have any information to indicate transportation or a vehicle,” Myren said.According to Myren, Semrinec stands 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighs 180 pounds. He has military-cut brown hair and brown eyes.“He has a tattoo of a fish on his leg, and was last seen wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt,” Myren wrote. “He may be carrying a backpack.”Anyone with information on Semrinec’s whereabouts should call APD at 786-8900.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Brian Semrinec, last seen checking out of the Downtown Ramada Inn at 115 E. 3rd Ave. at about 9 a.m. Monday. Semrinec didn’t report for duty Tuesday.Myren says detectives working the case won’t openly discuss any details of the investigation -- including whether police believe foul play is a factor in Semrinec's disappearance, or whether any sign of his whereabouts since Monday have been found.“At this point it’s still an open and active investigation,” Myren said. “I don’t have any additional public information to release at this time.”U.S. Army Alaska spokesperson Lt. Col. Alan Brown confirmed Semrinec’s rank Friday, saying he serves as an artilleryman with JBER’s 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division. He also declined to discuss the case in detail, noting that APD is leading the investigation.“I have no information that there’s any foul play,” Brown said. “There’s no information to suggest that he’s a danger to himself or the community.”Bradenton, Fla. resident Murray Miller, whose son was a close childhood friend of Semrinec’s, describes him as an outgoing character who formed deep bonds with many of the people he met even before he joined the Army, serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan.“This kid’s a hero,” Miller said. “If he disappeared here, a thousand people would probably be out looking for him.”While Semrinec was previously stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C., Miller says he specifically sought a deployment to Anchorage and had “embraced the post, embraced the culture.”“This is what he wanted, this is what he fought for,” Miller said. “This is his dream post.”Despite a popular outpouring of concern about Semrinec among Bradenton residents, Miller says they haven’t received much information about the case thus far. He says locals are hoping Anchorage residents can help find Semrinec.“We haven’t heard anything; his family’s flying dark,” Miller said. “This is not normal, for him to disappear like that -- he’s very, very concerned about his family and friends.”Back in Anchorage, Brown says Semrinec’s comrades in the 4/25 also hope for his safe return.“We obviously want to find him as soon as we can, because he’s one of our soldiers and we’re concerned for him,” Brown said.According to Myren, Semrinec stands 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighs 180 pounds. He has military-cut brown hair and brown eyes.“He has a tattoo of a fish on his leg, and was last seen wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt,” Myren wrote in an initial statement on the case Thursday. “He may be carrying a backpack.”Myren asks that anyone with information on Semrinec’s whereabouts call APD at 907-786-8900. Semrinec's friends and family in Bradenton have also set upa dedicated Facebook groupcoordinating efforts to find him.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

There's like a million dead anchovies floating around, as well as other fish," said Lisa Lascody, a resident of the area. "It's creepy and weird,"Crews spent Sunday cleaning up, and although carcasses continued to litter the water on Monday, a supervisor with the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors said clean up efforts were over.The supervisor estimated that about 3,000 to 4,000 fish carcasses were removed from the harbor.The remaining dead fish floating in the water would either get eaten or eventually be pushed out into the ocean, the supervisor added.It was unclear why exactly the dead fish washed up in the first place, but one marine expert speculates the amount of fish could have sucked the oxygen out of the water, and that could have caused them to die."The currents in here… it gets trapped in here, it doesn't have a good flow. So it's possible all these anchovies came in here, then all the other fish came in here, and all of that massive load of anchovies…sucked out all of the oxygen in the water. And through that, everything died," said Eric Martin, the facility director and educational co-director of Roundhouse Aquarium, a marine studies lab in Manhattan Beach that teaches about the ocean and marine life.The was not the first time numerous dead fish showed up dead in Southern California waters. In March 2011, millions of small fish turned up dead in King Harbor in Redondo Beach, according to the Los Angeles Times.In that incident, it was believed that the fish used up all the oxygen after swimming into the marine en masse and eventually suffocated, the Times reported.No email address was supplied by.

Buyers were located in Alaska and elsewhere in the United States.Conrad and Dunn paid the Canadian supplier to purchase and provide more tusks for resale.The scheme brought in roughly $1.1 million worth of tusks, of which between $400,000 and $1 million were sold.“In this conspiracy, Dunn and Conrad flouted U.S. law and international agreements that protect marine mammals like the narwhal from commercial exploitation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney Robert General Dreher. “If left unchecked, this illegal trade has the potential to irreparably harm the species.”Dunn is scheduled to be sentenced by in the District of Alaska on March 20. The maximum penalty for conspiring to illegally traffic and trafficking narwhal tusks is five years of incarceration and a fine of $250,000.Conrad also conspired to commit money laundering crimes, so he faces a maximum of 20 years incarceration and a fine of $250,000.Andrew Zarauskas, who is a codefendant in the scheme, has a trial set for Feb. 4 in Bangor, Maine.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Get tips on how to add some definition to your arms.<COL>By Echelle,Pure MattersWomen often want to train and condition their bodies to look more toned, defined, and strong. They see guys getting muscular definition and believe it’s out of reach for them. Not true! Here’s some insight into how women canbuild muscle --and why it happens faster for men.Don’t be scared of your strengthIn order to build up your muscles, you first have to tear them down. That’s right! Lifting heavierweightswill create tears in the muscle fibers, and when they repair, muscles grow.Separate the muscles in your body into large groups (legs & glutes, back & shoulders, abdominals & arms) so you can work out a new group each day. Here’s a suggested schedule:Monday: legs & glutes,Tuesday: back & shouldersWednesday: abdominals & armsAfter the targeted body parts have beenstrength trained, do somecardiovascular exercisefor 30 minutes or more. The complete workout should be approximately one hour. You’ll be exercising each muscle group and giving the group a break in between. Your goal should be to increase the weight by five pounds every few weeks. The key is to set small, measurable, and attainable goals -- and follow through.Besides looking leaner and stronger,strength trainingbenefits women by increasing bone density and increasing joint health. Plus, it helps us feel a lot more confident about our bodies.Don’t be scared of restingGive yourself a break. Choose which two days during the week are going to be your ‘chill out’ days and then do just that. You need to be disciplined about your rest time too!Don’t be scared of foodEat lots of protein, fruits, and veggies. And because you’re working your muscles hard and strengthening your joints, don’t forget to take yourfish oiland other importantvitamins and minerals. It’s also important that you remember to hydrate. As you become more and more engaged in your workout routine, you will also become more in tune with what your body needs; you will see the difference it is making and your body will share its innate wisdom with you. You’ll begin to eat in order to fuel the magnificent system that is your body instead of just eating to feel full or because something looks tempting. You’ll naturally want to feed your body food that is good for it. Every calorie matters and muscles need the calories in order to grow. So make those calories count.Why it’s easier for menEverything described above applies to men as well. Because of the difference in hormones men and women have, men will see a dramatic difference earlier in their training. So, women, if you fear that you will ‘she hulk’ by strength training, please don’t. Your feminine estrogen will prevent that, I promise!Source:http://blog.purematters.com/fitness/building-muscle-women-vs-menDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

And as much as Doan wants to end the suspense and sign the final long-term deal of his career, Phoenix general manager Don Maloney has work to do as well.Even if Doan returns, the Coyotes needed an upgrade in firepower, and replacing Ray Whitney and Taylor Pyatt with Steve Sullivan and David Moss doesn't even get them back to status quo. Maloney was never impressed by the summer free agent class -- as evidenced by his quick trigger in trading for Zbynek Michalek on draft day -- and he's willing to take on salary in a trade to upgrade his offense. But with the Doan issue unresolved, not to mention Jamison's deal to buy the team, what Maloney has to work with is a moving target.It any other year, under any other circumstance, Doan would probably be gone. But after leading his team to the Western Conference final and feeling the needle move noticeably when it comes to hockey's place in the Arizona sports scene, to walk away after all he has been through there is especially hard. The opportunity to be a Steve Yzerman, a Niklas Lidstrom, a guy who played and stayed and retired in one city does hold a lot of meaning.Does Doan want to play with buddy Danny Briere -- and far-from-friend Ilya Bryzgalov -- in Philadelphia? Does the Alberta pig farmer who has always had a ranch outside his window want to play and live in New York? Is he going to play in the heart of French Canada, where he had a long and painful controversy involving a French referee that had members of government speaking out against him?With a possible lockout looming and a new city council set to take over in November, this long, strange saga is guaranteed to end one way or the other.No email address was supplied by.

When you sink your teeth into a local sun-ripened tomato, it is the true taste of summer sunshine. Right now, keep your toms at room temperature and enjoy them with just a dash of sea salt or withfresh basiland a splash of three-leaf balsamic vinegar.Although nothing is like a fresh tomato, you can save some of that sunshine fruit in your freezer to use in winter months. Smaller tomatoes like Romas can be put in freezer bags whole. No prep other than washing is necessary. Larger tomatoes can be cut in chunks so that they fit in the bag. Later, just thaw, drain and use to make sauce, salsa or your favorite tomato dish. They are so much better tasting than tomatoes from a can or the wan tomatoes of winter.Barefootin’Feeling the sand or soft grass or gentle waves under your feet grounds you … literally! Connecting with the earth physically and being unfettered by shoes can energize you and remind you of all your own potential. Enjoy it while it lasts and take note of how great it feels to just be barefoot!While you are on vacation this summer or at home enjoying the long days, make a summer therapy package. Put some shells, rocks or pressed flowers in a special jar to remind you of your barefoot days. Then if winter’s gray days get you down, break out your vacation jar for a look and treat yourself to a foot soak or massage … and savor the feeling of barefoot days once more.Be Berry HappyLocalberriesare in abundance right now and they are oh so good for you. Like tomatoes you can freeze their yumminess and use them later in anything from pancakes to salad dressings. A smoothie gets a great start with frozenberries. To freeze any berries, arrange them on a cookie sheet in your freezer. Then, once they are frozen, put them in a freezer bag to store. They won’t stick together in one big clump and you will be able to use whatever amount you need.Sunshine on Your ShouldersMy favorite thing about summer is feeling the sun on my shoulders and the breeze on my back. I’m an outdoor girl and can’t get enough of the summer sun. So I was surprised to find that I had a vitamin D deficiency. I learned that it is not that uncommon for people who live in northern climes sincevitamin Dis produced in the body in response to sunlight. Even though you can get it in some foods, like fish or egg yolks,supplementsare a big help. And if you are a person who stays out of the sun on purpose and/or is a vegetarian the likelihood of having a deficiency is high. Having enough D is essential for good bone and muscle health, so it may be worth a check.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/pure-and-simple-savor-the-simple-pleasures-of-summer-and-save-some-for-laterCopyright  Internet Broadcasting.

Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness, and it’s been used to treat age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma as well as cataracts. Yes, it’s why your parents made you eat your carrots every night at dinner, and yes, it’s why you’ll never catch rabbits munching in your garden … they see you coming from a mile away (and, yes, I made that bit up).While pegging Vitamin A as the “healthy eyes” nutrient is appropriate, it’s limiting! Here are three other health benefits of Vitamin A.It can benefit your immunity.WhileVitamin Chas rightfully cornered the market on warding off colds and flu, you might want to consider Vitamin A, too. Its immunity benefits come in broader, hard-to-define strokes, but basically: Vitamin A helps in the production of white blood cells (those are the ones that fight off illness), as well as in the health of your mucous membranes -- your nostrils, your mouth, your eyelids. If those areas are healthy and their defenses are able to ward off illness, you’re less likely to catch that cold that’s been getting passed around.It can benefit your sexual health.Ladies, if you suffer from difficult periods -- the kind that stick around for more than the usual three to five days and tend toward the heavy side -- it may be due to aVitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A plays a big role in women’s sexual health, particularly during pregnancy, when it’s crucial in the development of an embryo.And Vitamin A isn’t just important for women -- when it comes to men, Vitamin A is “absolutely essential” to theproduction of sperm. That’s a key detail if you’re trying to start a family and looking to maximize your manpower. Interestingly enough, scientists suspect that inhibiting a man’s body’s use of Vitamin A eventually hold be the key to a male birth control pill.It can benefit your skin health.Because it’s an antioxidant and ultimately helps keep your cells healthy, Vitamin A can help with certain skin issues. It’s a common ingredient inacne medications, particularly those that treat cystic acne.If you’re past your acne days and more worried about aging, research has shown that topical application of Vitamin A can helpreduce the appearance of age spots. Vitamin A is a trendy ingredient in pricey department store skin treatments, such asLaura Mercier’s Mult-Vitamin Serum. (If you’ve ever tried that product, I’d love to hear whether or not it worked in the comments!)Sold on the benefits of Vitamin A? There are three ways to get it — through animal sources, like fish and eggs and dairy products, through fruits and veggies like carrots and sweet potatoes, or through a dailyVitamin A supplement.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/3-reasons-you-need-vitamin-aDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

If the title and previous line didn’t already give it away, allow me to now confess that my August raw food experiment didn't quite work out the way that I’d planned. Let me explain.In anticipation of Rawgust, I prepped, I shopped, I psyched myself up to no end. I chatted it up with my raw foodie friends; they chatted me up in return, and got all excited to welcome me into the raw food fold. I carefully planned out what I was going to eat and drink for the entire week, and made my veggie purchases accordingly. I made sure all of my “raw stuff” was organized on the countertop and in the fridge.I put on my game face and was ready to rock this raw show. I even cleaned up -- who am I kidding, I went all out and *polished* -- my super cool juicer, and pulled out a raw food cook book that I quickly got intimidated by and returned to its revered spot on the shelf. But you get the idea; I was pretty serious about the whole thing.On my first day, this is what I ate.Breakfast(after my steaming hot cup of tea):Green juice: kale, carrots, ginger, banana, apple. Survey says: delicious & filling.Lunch:Mixed greens salad with strawberries and tangerines on top, with a side of fresh apple juice. Pretty yummy, but I don’t think I ate enough.Dinner:Snack:Overall mood for the day:ExcitedEnergy:HighSleep:NormalThe rest of the week went pretty much like that, with a couple of variations in the meals. Then on the morning of Day 5, I woke up to a surprise on my chin. One of the biggest, baddest, most evil looking pimples I have ever seen. Oh, the horror! And to top it off, I also had one of the WORST headaches I have ever known shy of a migraine.After my medicine (that hot cup of survival tea), I called a raw foodie friend to inquire about the craziness that I had just encountered. She said, “Oh honey, you're just detoxing.” Detoxing?! I couldn't believe it. I thought I was a pretty clean eater in general. I couldn't fathom that I had enough toxins in my body to warrant such a public display of truth on my face. And the monster headache wasn’t lying either. I still don’t know how the raw foodies feel about taking supplements or medications, but I reached for the ibuprofen bottle and didn't let go until two tablets had been swallowed.Alright, I guess it's time for the whole explanation-for-raw-food-diet-failure part. Let’s just say things spiraled downward at an accelerated rate after the sushi rolling class I attended on Day 6 ….During the first half of the class, we learned a ton about the history of sushi: how it was actually a necessity before becoming a delicacy; all about the sushi revolution in the U.S. After some mouth-watering demonstrations by the master chef, we were asked to practice our rolling techniques by making our own rolls. Then we were supposed to sample our own rolls so we could judge them. In the end, the catalyst to my demise was nothing more or less than sushi rice.With the gentle prodding of the master chef to “taste my creation,” it was all over with one quick pinch. The chef then had us pair the sushi with our wine of choice. Oh boy. After two sips of that tasty red, the fish started to seem OK to sample because, well, it’s raw too, right? Right ….The next day I ate chicken. Cooked. Game completely over.I must take my hat off to the raw foodies out there, but for me, lesson learned: I love my fire. I’ll keep the juicing, salads, and smoothies up, but going completely raw doesn’t look like it’s in the cards for me anytime soon.I understand how healthy and vibrant a lot of people who swear by the raw food diet must feel. Maybe some day when I have more time, creativity, and feel less intimidated to create amazing raw meals, I’ll give it another whirl. Until then, I’ve got to roll.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/the-raw-diet-wrap-up-from-rawgust-to-rawbustDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Recalled cases of beef from Wolverine Packing Company in Detroit were shipped to distributors for restaurant use in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.By Barb Besteni, Staff writerIn a television commercial for a popular fast food chain, a father and son sit on the living room couch as the dad prepares to teach his boy an important life -- how to eat a pizza. It's a rite of passage the boy will remember for the rest of his life.But if he plans to live a long and healthy life, he may want to chow down on a carrot stick or two while bonding with his buddies.Take a look at the recommendations for what men should be eating for optimal nutrition and to help prevent some of the diseases common to them.Men are generally larger and have a higher muscle to fat ratio than women. As a result, they also have higher protein and calorie requirements.Extra muscle gives men higher fat-burning abilities. But if high-fat foods are your fuel of choice, over time the belts in your closet will start to shrink.And so will your arteries.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(.pdf), your expanding waistline increases your risk for heart disease -- the #1 killer of both men and women in the United States -- and a host of other illnesses, including stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.In an effort to curb male bonding through high fat foods, the CDC even provides guidelines forwhat to eat during a Super Bowl party."Eat healthy before you go to the party so you won't be as likely to overindulge," it advises. If you're hosting people for any game, the guidelines suggest that while it's OK to offer the traditional pizza, wings and chips, you should also add some healthy snacks to the menu, including vegetables and carrot sticks.Because men weigh more than women, they also require more protein.The recommended daily allowance for protein for the average man is about 52 grams per day. That's roughly the equivalent of about 8 ounces of meat. Protein requirements increase if you're an athlete or are physically active.Here's the formula for determining your personal protein requirements. For every pound of your ideal body weight, you will need 0.36 grams of protein. The key here is the word ideal. If you're overweight, the extra pounds should not be factored into the equation.Doctors also caution against eating too much protein since low-carbohydrate/high protein diets may cause kidney problems through a process called ketosis. Ketosis is said to increase insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease.Monounsaturated fats such as olive oil or omega-3 fatty acids offer health benefits to both men and women. But studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a vegetable-based omega-3 found in canola and flaxseed oils, may increase the risk of prostate cancer, the third most common cause of death from cancer in men.ALA has also been found, however, to be good for the heart. For men with risk factors for heart problems the benefits of ALA may outweigh the risks. But those with risk factors for prostate cancer should get their omega-3 fatty acids from fish and vegetable fats from olive oil, according to the American Cancer Society.Studies have also linked eating large amounts of red meats or dairy products to an increased risk of prostate cancer.The Cancer Society says men need to eat five or more servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day, limit intake of red meats and dairy products, and maintain an active lifestyle and healthy weight.Although statistics show that about 80 percent of those suffering from osteoporosis are women, men are not completely immune from the disease.A high-calcium diet is a woman's primary protection against osteoporosis, but a high consumption of calcium from food or supplements in men -- more than 2,000 mg. per day -- has been linked to an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.Studies suggest that about 800 mg. of calcium per day will protect men from osteoporosis without increasing the risk of prostate cancer associated with high calcium consumption. A cup of milk, for example, contains about 315 mg. of calcium.Although there are some differences when it comes to the dietary needs of men and women, there's one common theme for both sexes, regardless of age, fitness or health: When in doubt, check with your doctor to find what's right for you.No email address was supplied by.

As there is no guarantee that you will get regular rainfall when you most need it, what is the best way to water your plants and keep them lush and happy?  There are a number of factors to consider when you water your garden.The amount of water needed differs among individual plants and the type of soil they are growing in. Sandy soils drain quickly; therefore plants growing in them may require watering twice a week, especially during the summer.  For plants growing in clay soils, which hold more water, less watering is required; once a week for established plants is usually adequate.There are a variety of methods for effective watering.  Remember, long and slow is best.  Watering thoroughly once a week, (there are exceptions with new plantings and annuals) so that water gets to the roots of your plants, is better than sprinkling your garden each day.   I suggest starting in the early morning, before the sun begins to wilt plants.   Depending on the size of your garden, you may want to divide it into sections so that you can water one section one day and another on alternate days.   If you have a permanent irrigation system, you can set it to operate in different areas for various amounts of time, depending on the needs of the plants you are growing.  For example, you may have sun loving perennials in one area that will require watering at least once a week, while another area devoted to shade lovers will not dry out as quickly.Sprinklers are easy to use provided you allow enough time.  I prefer the oscillating types, which can be adjusted to fan out over an area.   Allow one to two hours, depending on the size of the area you are watering.  Soaker hoses also work well and you can place them where they are needed most in the garden.  You can attach the soaker hoses to an inexpensive timer too.If you’re not certain how much water is being applied by your lawn sprinkler use some shallow cans (tuna fish cans work well) to measure the amount of water applied by your sprinkler in one hour.  Then measure the depth of the water in the cans.  If the average depth is one-half to one inch, then you know that the root zone has been irrigated.For new plantings of shrubs and trees, put a hose at the base of the plant and thoroughly soak the root ball once a week.  As the plant grows larger remember, that the size of the root zone will also increase.  For plants growing in containers, water until the water rushes out the bottom holes in the pot.  During the summer months some container plantings may need to be watered twice a day.  If you feel the soil with your finger and the top inch is dry, it’s time to water.Applying a layer of mulch; one to two inches, will help conserve soil moisture and keep roots from getting too hot or two cold.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/how-to-water-a-garden-during-the-heat-ofDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Is it right for you?You should take a daily aspirin only if your doctor advises you to do so. If you have had a heart attack or stroke, your doctor will likely recommend you take a daily aspirin unless you have a serious allergy or history of bleeding. If you have a high risk of having a first heart attack, your doctor might recommend aspirin after weighing the risks and benefits. You shouldn't start daily aspirin therapy on your own.Although taking an occasional aspirin or two is safe for most adults to use for headaches, body aches or fever, daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects, including internal bleeding.Aspirin interferes with your blood's clotting action. When you bleed, your blood's clotting cells, called platelets, build up at the site of your wound. The platelets help form a plug that seals the opening in your blood vessel to stop bleeding.But this clotting can also happen within the vessels that supply your heart with blood. If your blood vessels are already narrowed from atherosclerosis — the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries — a fatty deposit in your vessel lining can burst. Then, a blood clot can quickly form and block the artery. This prevents blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack. Aspirin therapy reduces the clumping action of platelets — possibly preventing a heart attack.You shouldn't start daily aspirin therapy on your own in an effort to prevent a heart attack. Your doctor may suggest daily aspirin therapy if:If you've never had a heart attack, but you're at high risk of having one, the benefit of aspirin therapy is unclear. Clinical studies are ongoing to try to answer the question of aspirin use to prevent heart attacks. In the meantime you should talk to your doctor if you are at high risk.Before starting daily aspirin therapy under the advice of your doctor, you should let him or her know if you have a health condition that could increase your risk of bleeding or other complications. These conditions include:Your doctor will discuss what dose is right for you. Very low doses of aspirin — 75 milligrams (mg), which is less than a standard baby aspirin — can be effective. Your doctor will usually prescribe a daily dose anywhere from 81 mg — the amount in a baby aspirin — to 325 mg (a regular strength tablet). If you have had a heart attack or have had a heart stent placed, it is very important to take aspirin and any other blood thinning medications exactly as recommended.You might be surprised to learn that stopping daily aspirin therapy can have a rebound effect that may increase your risk of heart attack. If you have had a heart attack or a stent placed in one or more of your heart arteries, stopping daily aspirin therapy can lead to a life-threatening heart attack. If you've been taking daily aspirin therapy and want to stop, it's important to talk to your doctor before making any changes. Suddenly stopping daily aspirin therapy could have a rebound effect that may trigger a blood clot.Side effects and complications of taking aspirin include:If you're taking aspirin and need a surgical procedure or dental work, be sure to tell the surgeon or dentist that you take daily aspirin and how much. Otherwise you risk excessive bleeding during surgery.The Food and Drug Administration also warns that people who regularly take aspirin should limit the amount of alcohol they drink because of its additional blood-thinning effects and potential to upset your stomach. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.If you're already taking an anticoagulant, such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for another condition, combining it with aspirin may greatly increase the risk of major bleeding complications. However, there may be some conditions for which combining a low dose of aspirin with warfarin is appropriate, such as with artificial heart valves for secondary stroke prevention. But this therapy always needs to be carefully discussed with your doctor.No email address was supplied by.

You are in control of the ingredients and you choose how your food is prepared. You might be discouraged by marketing claims that you need a $500 do-it-all blender to cook healthier and to lose weight. I've been cooking for health for years and I run a natural pickling company, and I still don't have a $500 do-it-all blender in my home kitchen.Here is a list of essential items forcooking healthy food at home. While it's fun to augment the items on this list with things like a food mill or a mortar and pestle, you can certainly get by with anuncluttered kitchenstocked with just these essentials.Wooden Cutting BoardA healthy kitchen is nothing without a good cutting board. A large board is essential for chopping veggies and cutting fish and meat. Wood is the best because it harbors less bacteria than plastic and dulls knives slower than other materials like glass, although some people prefer plastic or glass for their ability to withstand dish washing machines. Maple is one of the best woods but can be pricey. Bamboo is common and affordable. The experts recommend applying food-grade mineral oil about once a month to keep a wood cutting board in good shape.Cast Iron SkilletCast iron, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Cast iron cookware is more dynamic than pretty much every other cooking material out there (although the original miraculous CorningWare dishes are a close second). Cast iron can be used on the stove and in the oven. When properly seasoned, cast iron is just as non-stick as modern “non-stick” skillets, except without the questionable chemicals known to occasionally leach cancer-causing agents. It is heavy duty and can literally survive a lifetime of use and is often passed down through generations (or can be found at garage sales). They are very affordable (Lodge 8-inch skillets go for around $10-$20). Oh, and they're great for sauteing and stir-frying (or whatever else you want to use your skillet for).Metal Mixing BowlsAt least one large mixing bowl is essential for the healthy home cook, although medium and small bowls definitely come in handy. Use mixing bowls for whipping up salad dressings, mixing your whole wheat dough, soaking potatoes, or many other tasks. Stainless steel makes the cut above other materials because it is lightweight, non-breakable, and easy to clean. Glass also works well. Plastic is more likely to absorb smells and flavors and deteriorate over time.Wooden SpoonThe wooden spoon is the humble servant of the kitchen. It hasn't evolved much since people learned to cook and needed to stir their pots. It still serves that purpose.Chef's KnifeTotally essential! A good, sharp chef's knife makes cutting and chopping all that farmers market produce so much more enjoyable. And don't think you have to bust the bank buying a knife. I own Victorinox and Global chef's knives (the 8-inch Victorinox goes for about $25 on Amazon.com, the Global for about $110, and both have a lot of fans) which are both absolutely wonderful. Since every brand of knife is made differently, you should try holding a few knives in your hand before you buy to get a feel for them. A good knife should feel natural in your hand (consider factors like weight and size of handle).ColanderA metal colander can serve multiple functions in a healthy kitchen. Use it to rinse veggies; use it as a steam basket; use it to drain pasta. I've also placed colanders over young transplants in my garden at night to protect them from slugs.A Saucepan and a StockpotA saucepan with a heavy lid is a necessary kitchen item, period, whether you're cooking for health or not. But it definitely facilitates the cooking of whole grains. The larger stockpot is necessary for making excellent stocks and stews. A large stock pot is also useful for canning or beer brewing, if your cooking escapades ever get to that point.Mason JarsMason jars are excellent for storage of all kinds of food. They can be used for brewing kefir or kombucha, for making pickles and jams, or for storing beans or noodles or spices. They are affordable, usually less than a dollar each for quart jars, and are easy to clean. I suggest wide-mouth mason jars since it's easier to work with the contents. I also suggest investing in plastic caps if you're working with acidic foods like kefir or pickles -- otherwise, the acids will wear down the tin lid pretty quickly.Measuring GlassOne good glass measuring cup is essential if you're following any kind of recipes or keeping track of your portions. The four-cup size is probably most useful, but a combination of a four-cup and one-cup capacity is best.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/10-essential-kitchen-tools-for-cooking-fDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Use these tips.<COL>(NewsUSA) - As you may know, heart disease is the number-one killer of both men and women in the United States, and it imposes astronomical costs on our health care system -- approximately $258 billion in 2006 when accounting for health care services, medications and lost productivity. So, what can you do in your day-to-day life to keep your heart healthy?Here are 10 tips from the Weight-control Information Network you should take to heart:* Measure up. Take time to measure your waist circumference. If it measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, your risk of developing heart disease is increased.* Be active. Incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity, physical activity into your day. And don't worry, you don't have to do it all at once. For example, take the stairs or get off the bus or subway one stop early so you can walk the rest of the way.* Stick together. Walk, jog or take an exercise class with a friend or a group. You can cheer each other on, have company while you work out and feel safe when you are outdoors.* Eat right. Make a healthy eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. It should also include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts. And don't forget a healthy plan is low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, salt and added sugars.* Have fun. Take part in physical activities you enjoy like walking, dancing, swimming or playing sports.* Choose fruits and vegetables. When you want a snack, opt for fruits and vegetables. Keep a bowl of fruit on the table, bags of mini carrots in the refrigerator and boxes of raisins in the cupboard for inspiration.* Multi-task. Build physical activity into your regular chores. For example, rake the yard, wash the car or do energetic housework. This way you can get your work done while adding physical activity to your day.* Listen to your body. Find out what physical activities you can perform safely if you have a previous injury or medical condition, and talk with your health care provider about your concerns. Also, be sure to follow advice about length and intensity of workouts.* Use fats and oils sparingly. You can find heart-healthy fat as well as vitamins and minerals in the following: olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, avocados, nuts, nut butters, olives and fish.* Track your progress. Write down your goals and what you have done each day. Seeing your progress on paper may help keep you motivated and heart healthy!Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

If yours has stopped spinning and either doesn’t work at all or makes a worrisome humming noise, it’s probably due to a jam. Something really hard has probably gotten stuck between the impellers -- the swiveling metal “teeth” that chew up the food scraps -- and the side wall of the grinding chamber, or, more likely, between the wall and the plate beneath the impellers. This is where little things like fruit pits, gravel and staples become lodged, providing more resistance than the disposer motor can handle. When a jam occurs, the disposer may shut itself down via an internal “breaker” switch, or the motor will keep running to no avail; that’s the humming noise, and it’s not good for the motor. Alleviating most jams takes just a few minutes.How to Un-jam a Food DisposerThe first step -- always -- is to make sure the disposer’s power switch is off. As an extra precaution, you can turn off the circuit that serves the disposer at your home’s service panel (breaker box), and that’s up to your discretion.Next, look inside the disposer with a flashlight to see if you can spot what’s causing the jam. Inspect carefully around the impellers and the impeller plate, particularly the small gap between the plate and the side wall of the chamber. If you see something, try to extract it with needlenose pliers, chopsticks, or other finger-like tool. You can also use your hands, but again, that’s a safety-risk call you have to make.If you got something out, try running the disposer again, with the cold water going (you should always run the water while using the disposer). Can’t find any obstruction? Skip ahead toMoving the Motor Manually. If your disposer had already tripped itself (no motor humming), look for the reset button on the bottom or the side of the unit underneath the sink. It’s small, so you have to look carefully. Press the reset button and try the disposer again.At this point, if you hear humming again or you hear the motor start to engage then quickly shut down, you still have a jam. If you hear nothing, you should try the reset button a couple more times, but chances are you need a new disposer (see tips, below).Moving the Motor ManuallyMost modern disposers have a manual crank -- this is simply an exposed Allen-nut head located in the bottom center of the disposer unit. Turning the head with an Allen wrench moves the motor (and impeller plate) manually. Look on the side of the unit or in the general area of the disposer for an Allen tool for this very purpose. Manufacturers often provide a little plastic bag for holding the tool, and any conscientious plumber will have stored it in a sensible location for you. If you don’t have a tool, find an Allen wrench (it’s hexagonal, or 6-sided) that fits the disposer’s crank head.Turn the manual crank back and forth, several times if necessary. You can move the motor manually in both directions, but because the automatic function moves only in one direction, going backward often dislodges (or breaks up) the obstruction. If the crank spins easily, the jam is freed, and the obstruction has either gone down the drain or it’s moved back into the grinding chamber, in which case you should fish it out.If your disposer has no manual crank, you can move the impeller plate manually by sticking a broom handle or strong stick (such as a 1 x 2 or 2 x 2) down into the disposer and levering it against an impeller and the drain hole in the sink. If a levering action isn’t possible, just try a simple push/pull action, as if you’re stirring a vat of hard dough. Go back and forth as needed to dislodge the obstruction.Tips for Replacing a Food DisposerUnlike most appliances today, food disposers are reasonably priced and actuallydurablegoods. They’re also pretty easy to replace. A standard, 1/2-horsepower model is the best buy for most kitchens. Follow the manufacturer’s installation instructions, and be sure to seal the sink sleeve (the top-most piece in the assembly that sits on top of the sink hole) carefully with an even bead of plumber’s putty to prevent leaks.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/how-to-fix-a-jammed-garbage-disposalDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Although the piranha is usually small  -- the red piranha grows no longer than 13 inches -- their teeth are set in powerful jaws, and top and bottom teeth interlock, giving the freshwater fish its ability to tear and rip flesh.There are no confirmed reports of piranhas killing a human, but the fish is known to scavenge on human carcasses in rivers.To read the original story,click here.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

And … braces. Please, mother!"She was a bit disturbed, I think, but being the doting woman that she was and still is, she simply made a quick no-going-back disclaimer and complied with my demands. We made appointments to see an optometrist and a family dentist, and I waited impatiently with clenched fists and closed eyes, dreaming of headgear, thick tortoise frames, and a school full of jealous pre-teens ….Well, it kind of worked out for me. The braces were a no-go ("Son, I'm sorry, but you simply do not need braces and I cannot give them to you. Please don't cry.") and I still had a tear in my eye when we drove down the street to visit Dr. Iman, who greeted me in his office with equal parts confused generosity and professionalism."My boy, your vision is nearly perfect. I suppose, if you'd like, I could give you a very small prescription in your left eye, but it really isn't necessary and I don't think—""I'll take it!" I said, and initiated a group hug between myself, Iman, and my poor mother.Ten years later and my eye issues had taken on a life of their own. Glasses were still not terribly useful to me, but now it was because I had been diagnosed with a corneal disease called keratoconus, and neither eyeglasses nor soft contact lenses could provide me with a workable degree of visual acuity. They just left me with blurry, detail-denying vision, which became particularly problematic when driving or reading.The only option for me and many others afflicted by this disease -- which is characterized in part by thinning, misshapen corneas and corneal scarring --  was rigid gas-permeable ("hard") lenses; but even these are not ideal because RGPs can lead to intense discomfort if not properly fit. Keratoconus patients require a certain degree of "artistry" in the fitting of their lenses, and since most doctors lack this particular impulse, I often have to remove my lenses and am left with a sort of French Impressionist view of the world.There's a light at the end of the tunnel, though, as I've recently been discovering some "home remedies" that have helped me keep my eyes in decent health as they continue to deteriorate. Despite the occasional setback, I've been able to better tolerate sub-par lenses and know that I'm doing all that I personally can to support my corneas and encourage them to heal. It feels pretty good.A few months ago I heard about omega-3 fish oil, which is known, among other things, for its ability to produce tears due to anti-inflammatory properties. I'm not exactly sure how it helped me, but I quickly noticed that I was able to tolerate my lenses longer. An ophthalmologist familiar with my condition recently told me that it was indeed a good idea to take fish oil for my eyes, so I've continued on a daily basis.Message boards and other patient-moderated online venues are often my go-to source for KC info, since it's rather hard (and pricey) to make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Plus, others who have the disease often have invaluable, practical insight that they're eager to share -- and I'm sure this is true for any disease or medical condition.Lately, I've been seeing a number of posts about vitamin A and other antioxidant-rich supplements, to take in conjunction with omega-3 or by themselves. Although I plan to use this combo (I started taking my "A" pills this week) with KC in mind, from what I've been seeing, it seems that vitamin A could also benefit others who suffer from the much more widespread phenomenon known as … dry eyes! Due to regular contact lens wear, especially, dry, itchy, red eyes can cause anyone heartache.Whether or not you have eye issues or wear contact lenses, taking vitamin A is a pretty good idea. True, it's well-known for promoting corneal health (that's exactly what I need) and general vision health (carrots are a major source, kids) -- but it's also a boon to your immune system, and can help out your skin and bones, too. To be honest, I haven't taken many supplements in my lifetime, but this is one I'm excited about and I hope it gets me on course to trying some other products for general or specific ailments.I wish I could go back and tell my 13-year-old self that he looks just fine without glasses. And more importantly, that he should enjoy perfect sight as long as he can. But it is what it is, and I'm going to keep reading up, and keep trying new things to help myself and my condition, because even small improvements make a big difference. In my experience, feeling in control of your body -- by taking supplements or exercising or changing your diet -- is often as essential to good health and having a positive outlook as a visit to the doctor. And I've also learned that braces, while definitely not ugly or uncool, are certainly not a required accessory.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/prevention/guest-post-a-wish-for-glasses-a-diagnosis-of-keratoconus-and-vitamin-aDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

You might want to incorporate some Thai flavorings into your cooking.Ancient teachings have long associated certain plants and animals with healing properties. Many are featured in traditional ethnic cuisines, such as the foods of Thailand. Modern studies largely confirm the health benefits of certain herbs, spices, seafood and animal products, a number of which star in sauces and pastes available at U.S. grocery stores.Following are examples of some common Thai condiments that can easily add exotic, delicious and healthful flavors to everyday American meals:Fish Sauce, perhaps the single most important flavoring ingredient in Thai cooking, imparts to food a distinct aroma and meaty taste often referred to as "umami." Rich in magnesium, calcium and vitamin B6, fish sauce is a savory addition to seafood dishes, such as linguini with clams, and to turkey or beef burgers. Fish sauce may become your new salt substitute.Roasted Chili Jam is made primarily from roasted red chilies, which help stimulate blood circulation, and ground dried shrimp. The jam adds a sweet, mellow taste to soups, is delicious in noodle dishes, Thai-style salad dressings and dipping sauces, and lends zest to such healthy vegetables as cucumbers, cabbage and green beans. Incorporate it into your hot dog fixings.Tamarind Paste imparts a delicious, fruity tartness to soups, salads, stir-fries and sauces, and is one of the primary souring agents in Thai food. The paste comes from tamarind pulp, which is high in vitamin C, vitamin B and calcium. Among its many medicinal uses, tamarind has been found to improve digestion, relieve gas and soothe sore throats. Use tamarind paste instead of lime, lemon or vinegar to give zing to fish.Coconut Milk is the base of most Thai curries and adds a luscious flavor to desserts, including rice pudding and homemade ice cream. Studies have shown the saturated fat in coconut milk metabolizes easily, providing a quick energy boost. In addition, lauric acid, the principle fatty acid in coconut milk, promotes normal brain development and contributes to healthy bones. And if you're lactose intolerant, coconut milk is an excellent dairy substitute.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies.<COL>(NewsUSA) - Exercise improves health at any age. But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies."Weekend warriors and boomers are more susceptible to injury because oftentimes they are not keeping themselves physically prepared," says Dr. Anne Meyer, whose private practice in West Los Angeles, Calif., focuses on sports rehabilitation.Physical activities can strain ligaments and muscles, and damage joints. Falls and overexertion can injure aging exercisers. But boomers don't have to exchange outdoor fun for weekends spent channel surfing.With a few steps, exercisers can stay both active and healthy. According to Meyer, exercising and stretching three times a week can help prepare boomers' bodies for active weekends.Simple stretching before and after exercise can help prevent injury. Boomers should always include warm-ups and cool-downs in their workout routines. Nutrition also helps the body recover from exercise. Limiting processed foods and consuming more fresh fruits, vegetables and high-quality proteins encourages the body to build healthy new tissues."Tissues are constantly being renewed. Sometimes what you remove from your diet is more important than what you add. Artificial sweeteners should be eliminated," Meyer advises. "To keep hydrated, exercisers need to drink water often. Eating a small amount every four hours can boost metabolism and keep bodies energized during exercise. Weekend warriors with arthritis may want to avoid citrus, which can aggravate arthritic symptoms. Fish oils are a good addition to help decrease inflammation."If an injury occurs, boomers should rest, apply ice, elevate an injured arm or leg, and consider treating pain with topical agents.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

However, many won't survive because fish or birds will eat them as they wash up on the shore, Rossiter said.Copyright 2012 byKITVAll rights reserved.

Alameda is the home port of the Coast Guard cutter Waesche, to which Obendorf was assigned.The Waesche responded Nov. 11 to the fishing vessel Alaska Mist, stranded near Amak Island in the Aleutian chain. Obendorf was injured while securing a small boat used to transfer passengers; he was taken to Seattle for treatment Dec. 6, but died Dec. 18 shortly after a surgical procedure.Coast Guard officials credited Obendorf in December with helping to save five lives from among the Alaska Mist’s crew of 22, hailing him as a hero for putting his life on the line.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The couple puts in 12 hour work days.  They're hoping to hire on some help in the future if spirits and profits continue to flow."People are really stoked about what we're doing here," said Copeland.In addition to selling their spirits in stores around the state, Shade and Copeland also self-distribute to certain bars in Haines. If their products are successful, they intend to expand into the Lower 48.The couple says currently its license doesn't allow Port Chilkoot to sell liquor at retail from the distillery in Haines, but they are working to amend it.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Police couldn't confirm locals' identity of the man because he wasn't charged with a crime, but say he has a history in the town of about 1,000 people.The Aleutians East Borough community of Sand Point is gathering Friday afternoon and evening to condemn the toll taken by drug abuse, afterresidents ran a suspected drug dealer out of townlast summer.The event’s organizers, Reclaim Alaska, describe themselves in an email to Channel 2 as “ordinary community members who are sick and tired of watching our community, both (locally) and at a state level, surrender to drug abuse, and the social ills which accompany drug abuse.”“We've had enough,” members wrote. “This is the official notice to the drug dealers, you are no longer welcome, we are going to do everything in our power to take our community back, and restore it to wellness.”Tiffany Jackson, the executive director of the Qagan Tayagungin Tribe of Sand Point, has played a key role in organizing the event. She says Reclaim Alaska has been boosted by a dramatic Aug. 20 incident at the Sand Point airport, in which nearly a dozen concerned parents confronted a man locally known as a drug dealer. The man wasn't criminally charged, but was forced to board the same PenAir flight he’d just gotten off of as it returned to Anchorage, with locals paying for his plane ticket.The incident, which Jackson calls “fuel to the fire” for the group, is part ofa tradition of frontier justice in Alaska,including the use of banishment as a punishment. She says about 30 locals gathered in September to discuss the impact of addiction to drugs such as heroin -- including what she calls a lost generation in the community of about 1,000 people.“It used to be you had a good fishing season, and you’d see people adding on houses or buying vehicles, very visible things you could see where people were improving their lives -- that’s not happening now,” Jackson said. “We’ve lost people. We’ve lost community members, vibrant young community members overdosing or dying, or just families being torn apart.”According to Jackson, Reclaim Alaska’s main mission is to take the town back from drug dealers. Its priorities involve working with local entities to help people addicted to drugs move toward recovery, as well as offering healthy organized activities that don’t involve drugs. One such activity, a gingerbread-house building contest in December, was sponsored by local employer Peter Pan Seafoods.“It may be slow building this movement, but if we build it a person at a time, five people at a time, hopefully it’ll spread through the whole community,” Jackson said.The Reclaim Alaska event is set to start with a rally from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Friday at the Sand Point school, where police, nurses and a former drug user will discuss drugs’ effects on their town. A panel discussion will follow, featuring Aleutians East Borough Mayor Stanley Mack and Sand Point Mayor Martin Gundersen, as well as the presidents of a local tribe and the school’s student council. The school’s principal and elementary students will give a presentation on what makes Sand Point a community, with a wrap-up from Mack about the day’s lessons.Cheerleaders will help conclude the school event, leading into an evening potluck followed by a rematch basketball game at the school between the Sand Point Eagles and the King Cove T-Jacks. In recognition of the event’s significance, admission to the game will be free.Channel 2's Tracy Sinclare and Matthew Smith contributed information to this story.No email address was supplied by.

Use these tips this summer.<COL>iStockBy Jessica,Pure MattersIt's officially the summer grilling season, and whether you’re entertaining a big crowd or having a family meal at home, chances are you’ll be firing up the grill. You’ll also be getting the yearly warnings about how grilling can producecancer-causing substances, also known as carcinogens.Don’t worry: I’m not going to tell you that grilling is bad and you should never do it. Grilling is delicious! With a few small tweaks, you can minimize the risks associated with backyard barbecuing. Read on for my five tips every healthy grill-master should know.Keep it CleanThe grill, that is. Give the grates a good scrub with a brush or scrunched-up aluminum foil after every use to keep from transferring burnt bits to your food the next time you cook. Or try the foil method:  Cool grill rack and place on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side up. Wrap the foil tightly around the rack, and seal, then place on a heated grill for 15-20 minutes. The food and grease will bake right off.Look for Something LeanerWhen fat drips onto a hot grill, it makes smoke … and carcinogens. Less fat means less smoke, so choosing leaner cuts of meat, fish and poultry cuts down on the risk. Also, the less time spent on the grill, the better, which makesquick-cooking fishand seafood a healthy, tasty choice for outdoor cooking.Something to Marinate OnStudies have shown that marinating meat before grilling it can reduce carcinogens by up to 90 percent! The jury’s still out on whether it’s the antioxidant properties of the marinades or that they simply create a protective layer from the heat, but it works. Plus, meats marinated in herbs, spices, citrus and healthy oils just plain taste better. Don’t try this with sugary marinades, though, as they make the meat burn faster. Save the sweet stuff for a baste or two at the end of cooking.Take Your Meat’s TemperatureIt’s no secret that charred meat is higher in carcinogens than its lightly-browned counterparts, but where does a grill-master draw the line? That’s where your trusty meat thermometer comes in. Cook burgers to an internal temp of 160 degrees, poultry to 165 degrees, and steaks or chops to 145 degrees, and no more. If the outsides start to burn before the insides are cooked, move meat farther from the coals, or turn down the temperature on a gas grill.Think Beyond MeatNot only are grilled vegetables delicious, but those grill-marks don’t leave a lasting impression. That’s right -- no carcinogens are produced by throwing vegetables on the grill. Some of my favorites are asparagus, red peppers and eggplant. And fruit is delicious on the grill, too, especially stone fruits like peaches, apricots and plums, served alongside ice cream or frozen yogurt. And grilled pineapple is always a winner.Try This: Grilled SaladInstead of serving up a plain old garden salad at your barbecue, grill one with more pizazz. Romaine lettuce is a sturdy salad base that will hold up well on the grill. Simply halve or quarter whole heads, brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, and grill until lightly charred. You can use this as the base for a typical grilled garden salad, or serve it drizzled with blue cheese dressing (I like to swap out the mayo and sour cream in most recipes for plain yogurt and cut down on the amount of cheese) for a summery take on the classic wedge salad. Halved, grilled tomatoes dress up your typical tomato, mozzarella and basil salad. And grilling onions brings out their natural sweetness. You can even grill radishes -- just slice them and cook them in a foil packet with some fresh herbs (dill is great) and a drizzle of olive oil. Peppers, carrots, even cucumbers -- you can grill them all!Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/healthy-grilling-tips-memorial-day-bbq#more-1519Copyright Internet Broadcasting.

It’s hard to avoid delicious treats when you’re pregnant, but I had to look out for the baby in my belly. (And believe me, ice cream was my first request after delivering.)The NIH providesa very helpful report on gestational diabetes, which outlines treatment options and general health guidelines for affected women. Basically, "… your diet should be moderate in fat and protein and provide controlled levels of carbohydrates through foods that include fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates … You will also be asked to cut back on foods that contain a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries." See what I mean about cravings put on hold?Food intake and related restrictions during pregnancy will vary from one situation to the next, but when it comes to supplements, there's a pretty clear consensus that prenatals are a good idea, and that they are essential for both mother's and baby's health. Recently,a study in Norwayfound that women who did not take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy had more than twice the risk of having a child with a language development issue compared to women who took these supplements. This study is what got me thinking about my own prenatal regimen.Unfortunately, I was not taking prenatal vitamins before I found out I was pregnant, but I started taking them the minute I found out. And actually, I continue to take them, in place of a multivitamin -- even though I’m not pregnant or nursing -- mainly because I’m of childbearing age and want more children. Along with my prenatals (which contained the crucial trio of folic acid, iron and calcium, in addition to other vitamins and minerals) I took DHA for my baby’s brain development. Taking fish oil also ensured that I didn’t need to actually eat fish, which can contain mercury. (According to the American Pregnancy Association, "Mercury is a contaminant found in fish that can affect brain development and the nervous system ... no more than 12 oz of low mercury fish should be consumed weekly ….")Molly is now almost a year old and talking up a storm! Of course, she has her own indecipherable baby-babble language, but she throws in a few mamas and dadas here and there. I’m confident that her language skills will continue to develop and she will keep hitting all her milestones on time, if not early. I definitely credit the supplements I took while pregnant and nursing for the great progress she's making.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/healthy-body/reflecting-on-my-strict-prenatal-regimenCopyright Internet Broadcasting.

We've gathered five gross everyday facts that could soon change that drastically.<COL>iStock / tlnorsAnyone who has ever watched the TV show "Hoarders" is probably drawn by the sheer shock of how those "filthy" people live. But the truth of the matter is, none of us is clean as a whistle.While we may not live like the folks on "Hoarders," we aren't clean freaks, either. There are horribly disgusting things we live with every day, we just don't notice them.In fact, if you thought about it too hard, you'd stay in a hot shower, scrubbing yourself until you were raw, and you'd never eat a hot dog again. But that is the goal of this article -- to gross you out.Sure, there's some educational merit to knowing the kinds of germs and filth in which we exist, but, really, we just want to make you uncomfortable in your own skin.And there's plenty of reason to be grossed out by your skin ...No. 5: Your body is crawling with bacteriaWhat kind of filthy animal allows himself or herself to be covered in bugs? Even if your dog brings them home, it reflects badly on the pet owner who is covered in the parasites. But that's only lazy, dirty people, right?Not so fast. You may not be crawling with bugs but you yourself are -- at this very minute, in fact -- covered in bacteria.We're coated, from head to toe as a matter of fact, in the stuff. That's the bad news. The good news is that those bacteria serve a purpose. They're there to improve health and defend against disease.So the argument is that if we didn't have those critters living on your skin -- and again, to be clear: every... single... solitary inch of it -- we'd have far more health problems, because the bacteria acts as a defense against disease.Does that make you feel any better? Us neither, but we're just getting warmed up ...No. 4: Dust is dead skinOne of the cliches of the Army drill sergeant is wiping the tops of lockers and other furniture with white gloves looking for dust. If Sgt. Pain finds even the slightest hint of dust, it's non-stop push-ups for the whole platoon.But even after you dust something, it doesn't take long for a fine layer of the stuff to accumulate. And if you wait too long between dustings, the stuff really builds up.The bad news is it's not just dirt that's coating your stuff -- it's you, too.Household dust is make up of such delightful things as dead skin, hair, waxes, pollen, mold, fungi, particles of fabric, insect parts, and even tiny bits of metal debris from anywhere metal touches other metal (think hinges, for instance).Mmm! Breathe deep!No. 3: Trillions of bacteria call your intestines homeWe learned how it works in biology 101: You use your teeth to chew food, breaking it down into small bits. Then muscles in your throat push it to your stomach where it is digested as it works its way through the digestive system. But there's more.Once food gets into the large intestine, bacteria goes to work on it, breaking it down so your body can use it. The stuff is actually good for you, because they help fend off "bad" bacteria that are trying to create infections.And the bacteria are part of a team -- one little critter can't do it alone. In fact, there are about 100 trillion cells from up to 1,000 different species alive and thriving in your intestines.So how big are 100 trillion bacteria cells? If you were to weigh them all, they'd weigh about 2.2 pounds.No email address was supplied by.

Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness, and it’s been used to treat age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma as well as cataracts. Yes, it’s why your parents made you eat your carrots every night at dinner, and yes, it’s why you’ll never catch rabbits munching in your garden … they see you coming from a mile away (and, yes, I made that bit up).While pegging Vitamin A as the “healthy eyes” nutrient is appropriate, it’s limiting! Here are three other health benefits of Vitamin A.It can benefit your immunity.WhileVitamin Chas rightfully cornered the market on warding off colds and flu, you might want to consider Vitamin A, too. Its immunity benefits come in broader, hard-to-define strokes, but basically: Vitamin A helps in the production of white blood cells (those are the ones that fight off illness), as well as in the health of your mucous membranes -- your nostrils, your mouth, your eyelids. If those areas are healthy and their defenses are able to ward off illness, you’re less likely to catch that cold that’s been getting passed around.It can benefit your sexual health.Ladies, if you suffer from difficult periods -- the kind that stick around for more than the usual three to five days and tend toward the heavy side -- it may be due to aVitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A plays a big role in women’s sexual health, particularly during pregnancy, when it’s crucial in the development of an embryo.And Vitamin A isn’t just important for women -- when it comes to men, Vitamin A is “absolutely essential” to theproduction of sperm. That’s a key detail if you’re trying to start a family and looking to maximize your manpower. Interestingly enough, scientists suspect that inhibiting a man’s body’s use of Vitamin A eventually hold be the key to a male birth control pill.It can benefit your skin health.Because it’s an antioxidant and ultimately helps keep your cells healthy, Vitamin A can help with certain skin issues. It’s a common ingredient inacne medications, particularly those that treat cystic acne.If you’re past your acne days and more worried about aging, research has shown that topical application of Vitamin A can helpreduce the appearance of age spots. Vitamin A is a trendy ingredient in pricey department store skin treatments, such asLaura Mercier’s Mult-Vitamin Serum. (If you’ve ever tried that product, I’d love to hear whether or not it worked in the comments!)Sold on the benefits of Vitamin A? There are three ways to get it -- through animal sources, like fish and eggs and dairy products, through fruits and veggies like carrots and sweet potatoes, or through a dailyVitamin A supplement.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/3-reasons-you-need-vitamin-a#more-1652Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

It's meant to be a time to commune with "God," "The Creator," or whatever your concept of a higher being may be. A Vision Quest is usually done alone on top of a mountain, or in a secluded spot in nature where you will not be interrupted or have any distractions. It is a pretty intense undertaking, but the personal rewards can be immense.In order to get ready for the 4 days during which I would be alone on my Vision Quest -- eating no food and drinking no water, with the exception of some sage tea if it became absolutely necessary at any point -- I had to emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually prepare myself. I began my preparations a year prior to the actual Vision Quest. As far as the official instructions for preparations went, I was to observe the following:Regarding that last point, the only vice that I had was my addiction to coffee; and I call it an addiction because I was convinced that I needed coffee in order to function. My work at the time required that I be at the office, brain in rapid-fire mode, by 7:00 a.m. Back then, there were no fancy coffee shops around every corner (like Starbucks is today) so I'd hit up the 7-11 and start my day with a 24 oz. cup at about 6:45 a.m. At 7:30, I'd move on down to the 20 oz.; then the 16 oz. around 9:00 a.m.; and finally, I'd wrap it all up with a quick eight ounces at 10:00 a.m. (All the while feeling pretty darn good about myself that I was drinking less and less as the morning progressed.)This was my Monday-Friday routine. On the weekends I still drank coffee, but it was nowhere near that amount. When I was told that I would have to give up coffee, my one vice, I was horror-stricken. The chief who led the Vision Quest ceremony calmly and in a very matter-of-fact way asked, "Well, it is a vice, isn't it?" I soberly nodded. He said, "Then you get to give it up." After two full weeks of the most excruciating headaches, the shakes, the worst moods ever, the loss of a couple of friendships (which I later regained), I had escaped the claws of coffee. If this sounds like someone detoxing from the worst of narcotics … well, this is what I imagine that must feel like. Those two weeks were just awful. But I knew that I had to go through it in order to be fully able to prepare for my Vision Quest, so I did. And once I got past the coffee hurdle, the remainder of the preparation schedule was practically a breeze. The Vision Quest itself is a whole other blog post ….Anyway, after my Vision Quest was over, I maintained a vegetarian diet, still including fish, for close to 5 years. I also kept up with many of the other practices that I was taught when preparing for my Quest. It was during this time that I rediscovered tea and fell in love with it. A cup of black tea has, on average, 1/3 the amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, and I could definitely feel the difference. But in the end, it made me feel better overall. Tea to me felt a lot more gentle on the system. It even provided a relaxing side-effect which was very different, in a good way, from the energy overload that coffee can give. What I didn't realize when I was all hopped up on coffee was that I was actually getting the jitters every single day; I was so incredibly hyper in the mornings, I was practically buzzing around the office. No more. Today I don't only drink black tea; I also enjoy green tea for the antioxidant benefit, chamomile before bed, and a variety of herbal teas as well.Now that it's been a good 14 years since my Vision Quest and my departure from daily coffee consumption, when I do have some every once in a while, I notice that even if I just have a regular-sized cup, I can actually feel it surging through my system. I don't like that feeling; I much prefer the gentle approach that tea has. There have been quite a few studies lately showing the benefits of coffee. For example, how coffee may ward off prostate cancer in men, and how it may fend off aggressive varieties of breast cancer. Just a few days ago, in fact, there was yet another, on how it can prevent depression in women. So for the health benefits alone, I'm not willing to say I'll never have another cup of coffee again. But what I think that particular lesson was about for me, was just to be conscious of what holds power over me and my life. I am a very firm believer that you can do fine if you have everything in moderation.Source:http://blog.purematters.com/healthy-mind/how-a-former-coffee-addict-switched-to-teaDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Get tips on how to add some definition to your arms.<COL>iStock/Studio1OneBy Echelle,Pure MattersWomen often want to train and condition their bodies to look more toned, defined, and strong. They see guys getting muscular definition and believe it’s out of reach for them. Not true! Here’s some insight into how women canbuild muscle --and why it happens faster for men.Don’t be scared of your strengthIn order to build up your muscles, you first have to tear them down. That’s right! Lifting heavierweightswill create tears in the muscle fibers, and when they repair, muscles grow.Separate the muscles in your body into large groups (legs & glutes, back & shoulders, abdominals & arms) so you can work out a new group each day. Here’s a suggested schedule:Monday: legs & glutes,Tuesday: back & shouldersWednesday: abdominals & armsAfter the targeted body parts have beenstrength trained, do somecardiovascular exercisefor 30 minutes or more. The complete workout should be approximately one hour. You’ll be exercising each muscle group and giving the group a break in between. Your goal should be to increase the weight by five pounds every few weeks. The key is to set small, measurable, and attainable goals -- and follow through.Besides looking leaner and stronger,strength trainingbenefits women by increasing bone density and increasing joint health. Plus, it helps us feel a lot more confident about our bodies.Don’t be scared of restingGive yourself a break. Choose which two days during the week are going to be your ‘chill out’ days and then do just that. You need to be disciplined about your rest time too!Don’t be scared of foodEat lots of protein, fruits, and veggies. And because you’re working your muscles hard and strengthening your joints, don’t forget to take yourfish oiland other importantvitamins and minerals. It’s also important that you remember to hydrate. As you become more and more engaged in your workout routine, you will also become more in tune with what your body needs; you will see the difference it is making and your body will share its innate wisdom with you. You’ll begin to eat in order to fuel the magnificent system that is your body instead of just eating to feel full or because something looks tempting. You’ll naturally want to feed your body food that is good for it. Every calorie matters and muscles need the calories in order to grow. So make those calories count.Why it’s easier for menEverything described above applies to men as well. Because of the difference in hormones men and women have, men will see a dramatic difference earlier in their training. So, women, if you fear that you will ‘she hulk’ by strength training, please don’t. Your feminine estrogen will prevent that, I promise!Source:http://blog.purematters.com/fitness/building-muscle-women-vs-menDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Larger moose tracks were visible on the bank, so the rest of the party watched for the calf’s mother.“We had no idea where she was,” Foster said. “All of a sudden, we heard the trees rustle and she was there on the same side of the river as my husband.”Despite the group’s fears that the larger moose would attack Foster, based on widespread reports of cows becoming combative near their endangered calves, it never did so.“For five, six minutes she watched him save (the calf),” Foster said. “It was very surreal.”Eventually, Troy was able to secure the calf with a rope and drag it free of the riverbed. He left it on shore and got back into his kayak, but the group didn’t immediately see the cow and calf reunite.“She was probably scared by all of us, well, cheering,” Foster said.Dave Battle, who works with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Anchorage, declined to make any specific comment on the Little Su rescue Tuesday afternoon. In general, he says, if people have ready access to professional help and the situation isn’t an emergency, they should request assistance when dealing with wildlife issues to avoid unforeseen consequences or injuries.“They should definitely call Fish and Game, or wildlife troopers,” Battle said.Safely home from their weekend trip, Foster says her husband weighed the risks before getting involved. In addition to carrying a gun, he also had backup from the rest of the kayaking party looking out for both him and the cow moose.“He told me he’d never have done it if he were alone,” Foster said.On balance, Foster says she’s glad the group intervened to save the calf.“He would have died if we hadn’t rescued him,” Foster said. “You keep hearing about things like this happening to people, but I never thought it’d happen to us.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

To get to work, firefighters sometimes hike across uneven, swampy terrain.A few days ago, crews hiked along a fuel break constructed to stop wildfires. The other day, “slop over” fires ignited across the break.Rick Thompson, a division supervisor with the state Department of Natural Resources, says the blazes were just a few of many more spontaneously igniting during the fire’s most aggressive days.“The natural fire comes and it had like 50, 70-foot flame lengths,” Thompson said. “And it was very hot and it was putting many embers over to the other side, and we were getting spot fires -- numerous spot fires.”It was Thompson who made the recommendation to evacuate Funny River Road a few days ago.“We looked across the valley, and right across the valley are several homes so at that point in time with the high winds, you just gotta call the evac card to get people out of there safe,” Thompson said on Sunday.Now firefighters are changing direction and considering whether to mount an offensive on the fire. Crews are using their hands to checking for heat in the dirt, before smothering it out.“It's pretty much just snubbed it out,” said Bitterroot Hotshots superintendent Chris Bolz. “It's the mop-up stage, so to speak, just making sure hot spots and heat is taking care of, and it's a done deal.”Even beating back the fire can be a time-consuming process, according to Bolz.“It takes some time,” Bolz said. “Hands usually pretty stay pretty dirty for most of the summer.”Fire officials say if the weather cooperates, these measures could be their last steps.While there isn't a lot of rain, firefighters say the moisture in the air helps to mix with ash and dirt to help smother the fire.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the fire was started by humans, and is asking people to call Alaska State Troopers at 907-262-4453 if they have any information about its cause or people or vehicles in the Woodcut Road area on the afternoon of May 19.Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Next to water, protein is the most plentiful nutrient in the body. You may know you need protein to complete your daily nutrient requirements, but may not know exactly what it is doing for you or how much you need.Protein happens to be one of the most versatile of all nutrients with many responsibilities in supporting your overall health. Most of us associate protein with maintaining healthy muscles, but protein is an important component of every cell, tissue and organ in the body. Protein supports your bones, brain cells, blood, skin, hair and finger nails. It supplies valuable enzymes that help regulate bodily functions. It acts as a "bus driver" transporting nutrients, oxygen and waste throughout the body. Protein is important for growth and maintenance of so many parts of your body.One of the most immediate sensations you experience from eating protein, besides the satisfying flavors, is its ability to satiate your appetite. High-protein foods slow the movement of food from the stomach to the intestine. Slower digestion means you feel full for a longer period of time. Also, combining carbohydrate foods with protein provides a steadying effect on your blood sugar, which prevents a steep rise in blood sugar followed by a quick dive that can trigger hunger. For example, apples and peanut butter, dried fruit and nuts, cheese and crackers, or steak and potatoes are great combinations of foods with carbohydrate and protein.Here's a guide for how much protein you need each day:* Sedentary Adult. Weight in pounds x 0.4* = grams of protein/day* Physically Active Adult. Weight in pounds x 0.5-0.75 = grams of protein/day* Competitive Adult Athlete. Weight in pounds x 0.6-0.9 = grams of protein/day* Adult Building Muscle. Weight in pounds x 0.7-1.0 = grams of protein/day* Recommended protein amounts per pound adapted from "Sports Nutrition: A Guide for the Professional Working with Active People."When choosing protein-rich foods, pay attention to what comes along with the protein. Vegetable sources of protein, such as beans, nuts and whole grains, are excellent choices because they also offer fiber, vitamins and minerals. The best animal protein choices are fish, poultry and lean cuts of grass-fed red meat. We have become accustomed to much larger portions of animal protein than we actually need. You may be surprised to hear that a healthy portion of red meat and poultry is about the size of the palm of your hand. Animal protein does contain saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol, so it is best to consume more moderate portions and alternate it with vegetable proteins.Of course, all these options are great until you try to take them on the go. A protein snack between meals curbs hunger, which helps you make more nutritious food choices. Throwing a steak into your purse for a quick snack is less than ideal and hardly appetizing. When your everyday foods aren't available or convenient, look to portable protein sources, such as trail mix, a hard-boiled egg, string cheese, edamame, or a high-protein bar like LUNA Protein. LUNA Protein is an indulgent snack for anytime of the day. It provides 12 grams of protein with key vitamins and minerals women need at the same time.Protein has earned its rightful position as a powerful nutrient for wellness. Understanding what protein does for you and how much you need will help you make better choices when it comes to replenishing, recovering and recharging your body each day.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The fear of the unknown, after all, is a very powerful thought.But before you apply your sunscreen and head off to the big-screen beach, you should familiarize yourself with some of movie's greatest underwater villains.No. 5: The Gillman from "Creature from the Black Lagoon"It wouldn't be right to do a list of great underwater villains without including the granddaddy of sea monsters, simply known as the Gillman.Introduced in 1954, this prehistoric half man/half fish also had a heart. One half of it had a huge crush on the gorgeous leading lady (Julie Adams), yet the other half -- the dark side -- didn't think twice about dispatching any other humans he encountered.True, the Gillman isn't the scariest villain to ever emerge from the waters, but he's certainly one of the most memorable. Besides, he's one of the coolest-looking movie monsters -- ever.There were three "Creature" movies overall, and the second one, 1955's "Revenge of the Creature," is also notable because it featured a young, unknown actor named Clint Eastwood in a brief role as a bumbling lab assistant who loses a lab rat (it crawled up his sleeve). Now that's scary.No. 4: Piranhas from "Piranha"Following a certain classic film featuring a great white shark in 1975, oceans, lakes and streams proved to be a fertile breeding ground for any moviemaker trying to cash in on the underwater predator craze.Enter B-movie king Roger Corman, who in 1978 unleashed a school of sharp-toothed fish down a river that were far more than your average ankle-biters. In the horror romp, "Piranha," Corman, along with director Joe Dante (who went on to helm "Gremlins"), invented a strain of piranha fish that were not only able to survive in rivers, but devoured everything -- especially humans -- in sight.Of course by today's standards, "Piranha" screams low-budget (a Corman staple), but it doesn't really matter: Once the seed was planted in your mind, trying to forget the idea of killer fish in your local lake or river is a thought akin to swimming upstream against a fast current.No. 3: Orca the killer whale from "Orca"Forget about "Free Willy," this whale tale (another '70s flick inspired by that shark movie) has some serious bite.Unlike Roger Corman's "Piranha," there was nothing to laugh about with this 1977 man vs. nature tale, where a big sea-hunter (Richard Harris) becomes the hunted after he kills the mate of an Orca whale. Of course, like any other films of the era, "Orca," technically, feels dated -- but it's thrilling nonetheless.In an honorable mention in the killer whale department, Monstro the Whale from "Pinocchio" simply can't be ignored. Just because it's an animated Walt Disney family film, there's no denying that Monstro is a frightening creature to kids, especially when Pinocchio, Geppetto and Jiminy Cricket attempt their escape from the belly of the beast -- and that's no lie.No. 2: Killer mermaids from "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"The best movie scenes are the ones you don't see coming, and the payoff is big in that regard in the fourth "Pirates of the Caribbean" in 2011.It starts with creepy build-up, where a group of drop-dead gorgeous mermaids (are there any other kind?) enchant a group of unsuspecting victims in song. But even the ominous atmosphere can't prepare you for what comes next -- an unforgiving attack on a band of scallywags.Plain and simple, what director Rob Marshall does with the mermaids in "On Stranger Tides" is groundbreaking (or water-breaking?), especially for a Disney movie.Suddenly, the studio that produced the classic undersea animated musical "The Little Mermaid" and director Ron Howard's brilliant comedy fantasy "Splash" (starring Daryl Hannah as mermaid washed ashore and Tom Hanks as her potential suitor), saw the killer potential in what have traditionally have been portrayed as creatures of beauty. Instead, the mermaids in "On Stranger Tides" -- bearing fangs like vampires -- torpedo their prey like a hungry pack of bloodthirsty barracudas.Prince William and Kate start their whirlwind tour of New York City on Monday, one that could include mingling with the American version of royals.No email address was supplied by.

I drinkCelestial Seasonings Morning Thundertea in a big beer stein, which I believe to be quite manly.I also hate to throw out anything I could reuse or recycle. So I scoured the Internet to find 50 uses for used tea bags and tea, other the primary functions of keeping me hydrated and awake. With thanks to "Reader’s Digest" and "Mental Floss" magazines, the Boulder Dushanbe Tea House, Chinaculture.org and several bloggers and Web forums, here is the definitive list of other uses for tea. We can’t vouch for all these home remedies, as we aren’t able to test all 50 of these items, so let us know how they work. Also tell us if we missed anything.Cleaning:1. Clean carpets:Clean up musty, dirty carpetsby sprinkling dry, used green tea leaves on the carpet. Let them work their magic for about 10 minutes, then vacuum them up.2. Clean antique rugs:Delicate Persian and Oriental rugs can also benefit from a sprinkling of tea leaves. In this case, sprinkle nearly dry, used whole tea leaves on the rugs, and gently sweep them away.3. Shine wood floors:The tannins in black tea can help shine and color hardwood flooring. Follow your regular floor cleaning routine by carefully rubbing some brewed tea into the floor (don’t use too much water on hardwood flooring) and letting it air dry.4. Polish furniture:Brewed tea also can help clean and shine wood furniture. Dip a soft cloth in a small amount of tea, and use it to wipe down the tables, chairs and more.5. Clean mirrors and windows:Tea can remove stubborn, greasy fingerprints from glass, and make it sparkle. Simply rub a damp teabag on the glass or fill a spray bottle with brewed tea.6. Clean toilet stains:Rumor has it that used tea bags can magically remove stubborn stains in the bottom of the toilet bowl. Just leave them in the toilet for several hours, then flush the toilet and brush the bowl.7. Get rid of fishy smells:Rinse your hands with tea after eating or preparing fish (or other stinky foods) to eliminate odors.8. De-stink fridges:Instead of baking soda (or maybe in addition), try used tea bags in the fridge to absorb odors.9. De-stink cat litter:Likewise, used tea leaves can help deodorize litter boxes when mixed into the litter. Dry, green tealeaves are recommended.10.Prevent fleas:Tea is also rumored to help prevent fleas, so sprinkle some dry used tealeaves around pet bedding.No email address was supplied by.

But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies.<COL>(NewsUSA) - Exercise improves health at any age. But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies."Weekend warriors and boomers are more susceptible to injury because oftentimes they are not keeping themselves physically prepared," says Dr. Anne Meyer, whose private practice in West Los Angeles, Calif., focuses on sports rehabilitation.Physical activities can strain ligaments and muscles, and damage joints. Falls and overexertion can injure aging exercisers. But boomers don't have to exchange outdoor fun for weekends spent channel surfing.With a few steps, exercisers can stay both active and healthy. According to Meyer, exercising and stretching three times a week can help prepare boomers' bodies for active weekends.Simple stretching before and after exercise can help prevent injury. Boomers should always include warm-ups and cool-downs in their workout routines. Nutrition also helps the body recover from exercise. Limiting processed foods and consuming more fresh fruits, vegetables and high-quality proteins encourages the body to build healthy new tissues."Tissues are constantly being renewed. Sometimes what you remove from your diet is more important than what you add. Artificial sweeteners should be eliminated," Meyer advises. "To keep hydrated, exercisers need to drink water often. Eating a small amount every four hours can boost metabolism and keep bodies energized during exercise. Weekend warriors with arthritis may want to avoid citrus, which can aggravate arthritic symptoms. Fish oils are a good addition to help decrease inflammation."If an injury occurs, boomers should rest, apply ice, elevate an injured arm or leg, and consider treating pain with topical agents.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

In using air-dropped retardant to battle the Funny River wildfire, firefighters had to balance protecting property with watching out for waterways.<COL>Funny River Fire Retardant Use Offers Benefits, DrawbacksLakes, streams and rivers weave across the Kenai Peninsula. In using air-dropped retardant to battle the Funny River wildfire, firefighters had to balance protecting property with watching out for waterways.Streaks of red retardant still mark the forest near Funny River Road.“The reason it’s red is dye, so we can see it -- so we can connect it and see it from the air,” said Alaska Department of Natural Resources division supervisor Rick Thompson.Retardant also contains clay and ammonium phosphate, a fertilizer. Air support supervisor Ty Miller says biologists are studying possible effects of retardant on the local ecosystem. Dropping water helps put out the flames, but sometimes just doesn't do it alone.“It retards the fire as it's trying to burn through the fuels,” Miller said. “Water would simply evaporate through the air and burn off quickly.”While crews have already used some retardant near Funny River itself, Miller says retardant is usually kept away from water to protect fish from smothering.“They always hear that we have to keep it away from water, so I think there's just a natural connection for people to think, ‘Retardant, water – bad,’” Miller said.Steve Miller, a deputy manager with the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, says while dropping retardant on the refuge isn't ideal, it's important to weigh the costs and the benefits.“We had told the (incident commander) to use fire retardant whenever necessary, to protect structures off the refuge or to keep the fire from moving off of the refuge,” Miller said.While lines of retardant stand out now, fire officials say with more rain they will slowly wear away.The total cost for fire retardant dropped on the Funny River wildfire to date is estimated at more than $700,000.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They also have injuries from an encounter with a porcupine, which zoo officials say probably crawled into their den to escape the flame."Right now it's just recuperation for them after the ordeal they've been through, and gaining their strength, getting hydrated, and getting their energy levels back up," said Pat Lampi, the zoo's executive director.The pups, which are about two weeks old, are fed puppy formula every three hours. On Thursday, they drank 50 grams -- twice as much as they did the day before, according to curator Shannon Jensen.During feedings, keepers conduct full body exams to check for porcupine quills, which they're still finding."They can wreak havoc on their internal organs and even kill them," Jensen said.Ken Marsh, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Division of Wildlife Conservation, says the orphaned pups' rescue is a very rare situation, which is garnering a lot of interest."We've actually pulled something from the smoldering ashes here, and maybe some good is going to come out of it," said Marsh.That good might be difficult to see through all the destruction. Although the Funny River fire has killed a great deal of wildlife, biologists say lush habitats will later grow."It allows the new growth to come up, which is needed by moose, hares, grouse, all of those kind of critters," Marsh said.Fish and Game is working to find a permanent home for the litter and wants the pups to stay together.

One diet claims to offer something like that.<COL>iStock / MartiSaizBy Barbara A. Besteni, Contributing writerIn "Defending Your Life," a 1991 film starring Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks, the protagonists died and went to Judgment City, a kind of way station where it was decided if they would go on to the next level or go back for another life on Earth.In one scene, the two are seen gorging on platefuls of food. One of the perks of being dead, apparently, is eating all you want and not gaining an ounce. But you don't have to wait until the afterlife to eat more and weigh less.You can start by making a few simple changes to your diet.The concept of eating more to weigh less has been popular since the publication of "Eat More, Weigh Less: Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Losing Weight Safely While Eating Abundantly."If you're attracted because you think you'll be able to scarf down giant slices of cake, refined carbohydrates, ice cream and pints of beer, get ready for the bad news. That's not what this diet is about.While the catchy name is sure to have attracted hundreds in search of diet Nirvana, the reality is that the foods you eat and quality of the food is what helps you keep off the pounds, and the only magic formula for losing weight is to eat fewer calories than you burn.The body is a great mathematician. And it will forgive the 500 calories in your grande mocha choco-latte only if you find a way to burn them before the end of the day or you deprive yourself of something else to make up for the calories."I've been following this diet since I was in high school," says Linda Hopkins, a 5-foot-3-inch South Florida woman who looks more like one of her students than a 52-year-old math teacher. At 110 pounds, Hopkins says she can still fit into her prom dress.Good habits start early, she says."When I was growing up, there was always an abundance of fruits and vegetables at home," she says. "Don't get me wrong, I had my share of Twinkies and Good Humor ice cream. But because I was feeding my body good quality foods, it let me get away with the occasional bad sugar and white flour."Ornish's diet is simple: Eat large quantities of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grain breads and cereals, and the fruits and vegetables that Hopkins ate so much of as a child. Because the diet is high in fiber and volume, you fill up quickly. The high fiber also keeps you fuller longer.But perhaps the most important key to the success of this diet is that it requires you to eat complex carbohydrates, not ones with simple, processed sugars found in white bread, rice and pasta. Complex carbs don't cause spikes in your blood sugar levels. Because your blood sugar stays relatively stable, you won't find yourself battling sugar cravings an hour after a meal.The diet recommends eating the following whenever you're hungry: Beans and legumes, any kind of fruit, vegetables or whole grain foods.In each case, you need to read labels to make sure a food doesn't contain added sugar, or sugar disguised as fructose.You can eat as much of these foods as you want, as long as you stop when you are full, the diet says.Stopping when you're full is a key component. However, fans of the diet say this is easier to do than on most diets."I think it's because you get to eat a lot of filling foods on this diet. A bowl of whole wheat pasta and a salad fills me up pretty quickly. And the fact (that) the whole wheat pasta won't send my blood sugar crashing after an hour is an added bonus. I stay full a lot longer," Hopkins says.If you can't eliminate dairy from your diet entirely, you should choose the nonfat variety, but consume it in moderation.The strictest part of the diet is the recommendation that you avoid meat, fish, chicken, anything containing fat or oil, nuts, alcohol and commercially prepared foods with more than 2 grams of fat.Hopkins, however, says this is one part of the diet she doesn't follow. She doesn't feel guilty about it."If I had to live without a filet mignon and a glass or two of merlot once in a while, life would not be worth living," she laughs. "Guilt leads to deprivation, which eventually leads to throwing your hands up and forgetting all about healthy eating."No email address was supplied by.

Children, between uncovered sneezes and unwashed hands, quickly spread germs to classmates.<COL>iStock Image(NewsUSA) - Sniffles and sneezes, sore throats and coughs -- the return to school heralds cold and flu season's start. Children, between uncovered sneezes and unwashed hands, quickly spread germs to classmates.When cold season comes, it arrives with a vengeance. But parents can boost their children's overall health, helping young immune systems fight disease. Here are some tips for parents looking to escape flu season unscathed:- Keep children active. For many children, cold weather means couch-potato behavior. But from visiting pumpkin patches to ice skating, the fall and winter provide fun activities. Physically active children possess healthier immune systems, which help fight off infection. When it's too cold to play outside, consider indoor activities, like bowling or dancing.- Watch your kids' diets. A healthy diet keeps young immune systems strong. Make sure that children eat healthy meals that include vegetables, fruit, healthy protein and whole grains. A healthy breakfast before school keeps young minds sharp and provides immune-supporting nutrition. If children won't eat breakfast, offer milk or 100 percent fruit juice and a multivitamin.Even in children who don't skip meals, multivitamins fill nutritional gaps. Look for multivitamins without artificial preservatives or colors, like L'il Critters Immune C plus Zinc and Echinacea, which support healthy immune function and taste like regular gummy candies. L'il Critters Omega-3 Gummy Fish contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which improve concentration and help prevent disease.- Allow unstructured play. Among school, sports, music lessons and community organizations, children can feel stressed and tired. While structured activities have their benefits, too much stress leads to poorer immune function. Make sure children have time for imaginative play, and you will see fewer sniffles through the school year.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Recalled cases of beef from Wolverine Packing Company in Detroit were shipped to distributors for restaurant use in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.By Barb Besteni, Staff writerIn a television commercial for a popular fast food chain, a father and son sit on the living room couch as the dad prepares to teach his boy an important life -- how to eat a pizza. It's a rite of passage the boy will remember for the rest of his life.But if he plans to live a long and healthy life, he may want to chow down on a carrot stick or two while bonding with his buddies.Take a look at the recommendations for what men should be eating for optimal nutrition and to help prevent some of the diseases common to them.Men are generally larger and have a higher muscle to fat ratio than women. As a result, they also have higher protein and calorie requirements.Extra muscle gives men higher fat-burning abilities. But if high-fat foods are your fuel of choice, over time the belts in your closet will start to shrink.And so will your arteries.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(.pdf), your expanding waistline increases your risk for heart disease -- the #1 killer of both men and women in the United States -- and a host of other illnesses, including stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.In an effort to curb male bonding through high fat foods, the CDC even provides guidelines forwhat to eat during a Super Bowl party."Eat healthy before you go to the party so you won't be as likely to overindulge," it advises. If you're hosting people for any game, the guidelines suggest that while it's OK to offer the traditional pizza, wings and chips, you should also add some healthy snacks to the menu, including vegetables and carrot sticks.Because men weigh more than women, they also require more protein.The recommended daily allowance for protein for the average man is about 52 grams per day. That's roughly the equivalent of about 8 ounces of meat. Protein requirements increase if you're an athlete or are physically active.Here's the formula for determining your personal protein requirements. For every pound of your ideal body weight, you will need 0.36 grams of protein. The key here is the word ideal. If you're overweight, the extra pounds should not be factored into the equation.Doctors also caution against eating too much protein since low-carbohydrate/high protein diets may cause kidney problems through a process called ketosis. Ketosis is said to increase insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease.Monounsaturated fats such as olive oil or omega-3 fatty acids offer health benefits to both men and women. But studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a vegetable-based omega-3 found in canola and flaxseed oils, may increase the risk of prostate cancer, the third most common cause of death from cancer in men.ALA has also been found, however, to be good for the heart. For men with risk factors for heart problems the benefits of ALA may outweigh the risks. But those with risk factors for prostate cancer should get their omega-3 fatty acids from fish and vegetable fats from olive oil, according to the American Cancer Society.Studies have also linked eating large amounts of red meats or dairy products to an increased risk of prostate cancer.The Cancer Society says men need to eat five or more servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day, limit intake of red meats and dairy products, and maintain an active lifestyle and healthy weight.Although statistics show that about 80 percent of those suffering from osteoporosis are women, men are not completely immune from the disease.A high-calcium diet is a woman's primary protection against osteoporosis, but a high consumption of calcium from food or supplements in men -- more than 2,000 mg. per day -- has been linked to an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.Studies suggest that about 800 mg. of calcium per day will protect men from osteoporosis without increasing the risk of prostate cancer associated with high calcium consumption. A cup of milk, for example, contains about 315 mg. of calcium.Although there are some differences when it comes to the dietary needs of men and women, there's one common theme for both sexes, regardless of age, fitness or health: When in doubt, check with your doctor to find what's right for you.No email address was supplied by.

The food you choose can make you feel better, some say.<COL>By Shiloh Woolman, Contributing writerRelief from indigestion, diabetes, headaches and even arthritis may be in your kitchen instead of your medicine cabinet.Dietitians and doctors are making the connection between food and pain, and say that changing your diet can change the way you feel.Pain and inflammation are the body's reaction to injury, but foods can reduce them.Shelly Asplin, a registered dietitian at Omaha grocery story Hy-Vee, said Omega-3 fatty acids go a long way toward fighting pain and inflammation. Asplin said she recommends foods that are high in Omega 3s to arthritis and fibromyalgia sufferers.Fish and seafood are often high in Omega 3, as are flax seeds and walnuts."A handful (of walnuts) a day gives you a recommended serving of Omega 3. Fresh, wild seafood from very cold water contains the highest sources of Omega 3 fats," Asplin said. "Flax has to be ground -- the complete seed only delivers fiber, but ground varieties have fiber and Omega 3s."Asplin said she sprinkles ground flax seed on her morning oatmeal.Omega 3s and more are also widely touted to lessen arthritis pain and inflammation. A list of additional foods is posted atMetabolismAdvice.com.Asplin said there are foods to avoid when fighting pain. She said refined and highly processed foods can cause inflammation."Whole grains are anti-inflammatory. Make sure the first ingredient is whole grain," Asplin said. "Whole fruit is anti inflammatory, but leave the skin on."John Mixan, a dietary life coach in Omaha, said his wife has successfully fought knee pain with diet. He advises clients to boost their intake of ginger, garlic, cinnamon, turmeric, curry and basil when they're fighting pain.Mixan said choosing diet instead of medication can create a virtuous circle."So much of it has to do with them being empowered. It's the whole mind-body thing. They're taking control, so not only are they putting better foods in themselves, they're taking control rather than delegating their health to someone else," Mixan said. "It's not that there's no place for a doctor, but control can lead to health."Mixan also said olive oil is a better choice than hydrogenated oils, which can cause inflammation.Salicylic acid is an analgesic -- it is what your body makes out of aspirin. A study in theJournal of Clinical Pathologyfound that vegetarians had higher natural levels of salicylic acid in their blood than non-vegetarians. Building on that study,Susan Miller, a PhD and registered dietitian, suggests boosting fruits and vegetables that are high in salicylic acid, which includes apricots, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, sweet potatoes and green peppers.The Cleveland Clinichas found that food may be among common migraine triggers. Some chemicals and preservatives in foods set off some migraines, while other sufferers may notice that "foods and beverages, such as aged cheese, alcoholic beverages, and food additives such as nitrates (in pepperoni, hot dogs, luncheon meats) and monosodium glutamate -- commonly found in Chinese food -- may be responsible for triggering up to 30 percent of migraines," the clinic reported on its Web site.On the other hand, caffeine is sometimes used to treat acute migraines.Also, water traditionally used to wash down a couple of pain pills -- may itself may fight regular headaches. In a study that debunked a slew of myths about drinking water, University of Pennsylvania doctors Dan Negoianu and Stanley Goldfarb found that one small trial did find that participants who drank more water experienced fewer headaches than those who did not. However, the doctors said the results were not statistically significant.The pain from both gas and some bowel diseases, like irritable bowel syndrome, can often be fixed with food, some say.The Mayo Clinicsaid gas pain is produced by air in the digestive tract. High-fiber foods and raw vegetables can be the culprit, so introduce them to your diet slowly. Mayo also said certain artificial sweeteners cause gas in some individuals, so try checking your gum or candy labels if you're suffering from gas pain.For IBS sufferers, pain is often triggered by food. TheWeb site HelpForIBS.comhas a laundry list of foods that may make pain and bloating worse, and advises sufferers to try leaving those foods out of their diet for a few weeks to test whether pain gets better.No email address was supplied by.

It's also lightweight enough that most handy folks swap out a unit without a helper. Yet if this is all true, you might be wondering, then why are so many dishwashers installed improperly? We've all seen dishwashers with doors that rub against the cabinets or those that lurch forward when a full rack is pulled out. The answer is a bit of a paradox: Like painting a house, installing adishwasheris easy enough that a lot of people will try it with little or no prior knowledge or experience, and some of us just have to learn the hard way.Water Line WarningsYou have to buy your own water supply hose and fittings for a new dishwasher. What you need is a 3/8-inch O.D. braided steel, flexible water hose with female 3/8-inch compression fittings on both ends. Don't buy one with a garden-hose-sized connection on one end, even if the thing is labeled "Dishwasher Hose." You also need a water line angle fitting for the dishwasher end and a two-port shutoff valve for the water supply pipe under the kitchen sink (if it doesn't already have one). Tighten all connections carefully and check thoroughly for leaks before buttoning up the dishwasher and forgetting about it. A small leak under the appliance might go unnoticed for a long time, wreaking havoc on your subfloor and everything below.Insufficient Door ClearanceWith the door closed, a dishwasher should be centered between the flanking cabinets and have an even reveal at the top (assuming the countertop is level). If your door rubs against a cabinet, remove the mounting screws (see discussion below) and tap or pry the dishwasher over for more clearance, then install the screws in new pilot holes. If the door grazes the countertop, remove the kick plate at the bottom front of the dishwasher, and use channel-type pliers to turn the feet—they have threaded posts for adjusting height—to lower and/or level the unit as needed.Problems with the Mounting ScrewsThe only thing holding a dishwasher in place are two screws securing little metal tabs (above the door) to the underside of the countertop. The thickened edge of a laminate countertop is 1 ½ inches. Guess what happens if you use 2-inch screws? Same thing goes for solid-surface tops (such as Corian). So, don't use screws that are too long, and be very careful when driving them, just to be safe.Granite and other stone countertops present a special challenge, since there's no wood substrate to screw into. Whatever you do, don't try to screw into the stone. Remodeler Tim Hewittsaid on Hometalk.com, "The use of side brackets is the normal way to secure a dishwasher in place with a granite top." You can anchor the dishwasher to the flanking cabinets, provided the appliance has side-mount tabs (many newer units do). If not, you can glue a wood strip or two small blocks to the underside of the countertop, then screw the top tabs into the wood (not the stone). In any case, talk to your countertop supplier or installer for recommendations.Faulty Drain HookupEvercalled a plumberin a panic because your kitchen sink drain was backing up into your dishwasher? If so, you know that this is every bit as gross as it sounds. This can happen if the dishwasher's drain hose isn't connected to an air gap device or, without an air gap, the hose doesn't make a high bend that reaches above the water level in the sink. Another classic mishap is to connect the drain hose to a garbage disposer but forget to remove the plastic knockout plug inside the disposer's nipple, so the drain line is effectively sealed shut. A tap with a screwdriver and hammer removes the knockout; just remember to fish it out of the disposer before running it.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/dishwasher-installation-mishaps-and-fixeDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Much like the first try of a spicy Indian curry, you'll wonder if you've made the right choice. By the end, however, you'll be gloriously satisfied and glad you took your time and savored every bite.The story of seven British retirees who wind up in India on the promise of a deluxe retirement community starts off at a slow pace, picking up steam as it makes its way from England to India and eventually embarks on its merry journey.The story is predictable enough. After arriving in India, the hotel is not what was shown in the photographs on the website. (Has this ever happened to you?) The Brits are aghast to discover that what they've been duped into is merely the dream of a young entrepreneur, Sonny Kapoor (Dev "Slumdog Millionaire" Patel). Pigeons are camped out in dusty rooms, toilets don't work, and rooms don't have doors. Yet, by the final unspooling of the film, each individual, from the big players at the center of the story to the minor character of a mute housekeeper, has discovered something valuable about their past, present and their future, realizing that their upstart host's desires aren't much different from their own. "In India, we have a saying - everything will be all right in the end," Kapoor advises each time one of his residents voices discontent with the lodging. "So if it is not all right, it is not yet the end."John Madden, who directed the Best Picture winner "Shakespeare in Love" and the recent thriller, "The Debt," assembled some of the most talented and recognizable British performers such as Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy, to have a jolly good time on photographic rich jaunts through Rajasthan, which the filmmakers call "one of the most romantic of India's states." Not only are the characters portrayed in the story as fish-out-of-water, but there's a genuine feeling throughout the film that the actors, too, aren't in their comfort zone, which adds to the appeal.The stand outs are the three most decorated actors. Oscar winner Dench plays the newly widowed, Evelyn, who discovers her husband has left her financially ruined. Looking to make a fresh start, she decides to create her own adventure. While the story does focus on each individual's story, it is Evelyn who is "Marigold's" balance and center, and Dench, looking bright in breezy linen shirts and pants against the colorful Indian backdrop, lights up the screen.  Wilkinson plays Graham, a recently retired civil servant who has his own desires for wanting to live out his retirement at the Marigold Hotel. As the genteel judge searching for his past, he's another reason "Marigold" blooms.Smith's character is probably the least likeable. The former live in housekeeper is a racist, crotchety wheel-chair bound senior citizen who has been sent to India because she requires a hip replacement. If you believe this woman would set foot in India whether she needed a new hip or not, I have an exotic hotel that I can sell you in India. Seasoned actress Smith pulls it off, giving the character needed depth. Especially priceless and showing Smith's true acting chops is a change-of-heart scene where she partakes in an authentic meal in a traditional Indian home.Unfortunately, the weakest link in the film is Patel as the perpetually sunny Sonny, playing the hotelier as a caricature and not showing the same knack for believability that he did in "Millionaire." However, his Indian co-stars, the beautiful Lillete Dubey as Sonny's mother, and equally stunning newcomer Tena Desae, as Sunaina, Sonny's girlfriend, are a pure delight."The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" goes up against superheroes this Mother's Day weekend in its wide opening (it has been playing in limited markets), but "Marigold" features superheroes of a different kind. Given a choice to take Mom to a hulk-sized mega picture or a travelogue through golden-year adventures, "Marigold" is definitely a better bed of roses.Prince William and Kate start their whirlwind tour of New York City on Monday, one that could include mingling with the American version of royals.No email address was supplied by.

Join us for a look at five of the most extravagant celebrity mansions out there today.<COL>There's no place like home, as the old saying goes, and that goes doubly for celebrities.Sure, we might be proud of our white picket fence, two-car garage, mud room and central air, but does your house have it's own 50-seat theater? How about a few holes of golf ... in your backyard? Or jet runway in place of your driveway?And who among us can boast about having a man-made lake stocked with rare fish just behind the house? Well, Oprah can. The 42 acres she calls home in Santa Barbara, Calif., include just such a lake, along with a 23,000 square foot mansion featuring six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, 10 fireplaces, a home theater and a quarter-mile long driveway paved with hand-laid sandstone bricks.And you thought your "honey do" list was long.But Oprah's mansion doesn't even make our list of the five most lavish celebrity pads. Face it, in some ways celebrities might be just like you or me, but not when it comes to their very sweet home sweet homes.Up first, what is the deal with this home?!No. 5: Jerry Seinfeld - East Hampton, New YorkWe all know the housing market has tanked over the last few years, but you have to expect Jerry Seinfeld's house is still worth a pretty penny.After all, the comedian bought the lavish East Hampton, N.Y., estate from Billy Joel for a then-record $32 million in 2000. And what did the "master of his domain" get for that price tag? Quite a bit actually.The home, described in previous real estate listings as a "magnificent Tudor-style waterfront manor," sits on 14 acres of rolling lawns. It actually is three separate buildings adding up to a total of 24 rooms, including 13 bathrooms (although only eight of them are full baths).Then there are the 13 fireplaces, a gym, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis court, bowling alley, guest cottage, music room, yada yada yada, and a wine cellar. Whew! Quite a bit to fit into one home, not that there's anything wrong with that.Oh, and the annual taxes on the House of Seinfeld? Around $210,000. Get out!Our next celebrity mansion is one "fresh" house ...No. 4: Will and Jada Pinkett Smith - Calabasas, CaliforniaWhat kind of home is fit for a box office king like Will Smith? Well, a castle of course.Known as Calabasas Castle, Will and Jada Smith's sweeping home near California's Santa Monica Mountains has its own lake, basketball court, tennis court and a pair of private par three golf holes in the backyard.The $20 million estate is so lavish and spectacular that the family, including budding movie stars Willow, 10, and Jaden, 13, star of the 2010 remake of "The Karate Kid," had to wait out the seven years it took to build the mansion before they could move in in 2004.The wait caused Will Smith to once crack, "The problem is that you build your dream home, but then you're seven years older so it's the house you used to want real bad!" Man, more money more problems indeed.It had to be especially frightening for the family when they were temporarily forced from the home in 2005 when a brushfire threatened to destroy the property and several other houses in the area. Thankfully, the "Fresh Prince's" house was spared.Our next mansion is lavish enough for a pop diva, fitting since it's owned by one ...No. 3: Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon - Beverly Hills, CaliforniaYou may think your house is pretty cool, but does it have a name? The palatial Beverly Hills property owned by Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon does.No email address was supplied by.

In #Kodiak and the district’s seven remote village sites, educators are doing just that in unique ways.<COL>Rural Education: Kodiak Focuses on Providing Students OptionsThere's no shortage of opportunities for the 2,500 students in the Kodiak Island Borough School District, and the district does what it can to make sure every student starts off strongFrom fulfilling aspirations to create chemical solutions, cruise in the schools K Hi-C fishing vessel, or be a part of construction projects, for certified welder Hannah Christian, she's getting the best of both worlds.Christian wants to study fisheries in college, but says because of her opportunities in high school, she could work as a welder right now."If you want to learn cooking, you can learn cooking. If you want to weld, you can weld. If you want to do English, there (are) all sorts of AP classes,” she said. “We are really good of having a little bit of everything.”In a district that has limited access to the rest of the world, the challenge is figuring out how to make sure all students are exposed to the same courses, no matter if they live on the island or in one the district’s seven remote villages.Having top notch technology like online learning classrooms and double robotics is part of the daily schedule."I can't depend on that airplane, and I can't depend on the ferry," said Stewart McDonald, the superintendent of the Kodiak Island Borough School District."Through video teleconferences, aligning everybody's schedule, we have students now actually in pre-calculus in our rural sites. They are taking chemistry."It's what McDonald says is the push to close the gap, by building a system so students can see themselves in a world of work after high school."We are having the largest number of our students passing those Accuplacer tests, and ready for their college level classes, because they are being challenged," he said."We have to first convince students that they are more than capable of college, they are worthy of college, but they are also capable of learning anything technical."Choices within choices that are the starting point for students in Kodiak down a road to lifelong success.McDonald said facing the type of challenges his district faces, many of the students are walking out of high school with certificates to work right away, or ready to take college-level classes.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Five wolf pups that were rescued by firefighters at the funny river fire will soon have a new home.The five wolf pups rescued by firefighters during the Funny River firewill soon leave the state for their new home in Minnesota.Currently being housed at the Alaska Zoo, the five pups will be taken in by theMinnesota Zoo, located south of Minneapolis-St. Paul in Apple Valley, Minn. According to Pat Lampi, executive director at the Alaska Zoo, this will not be the first time the two zoos have worked together to give orphaned wildlife a new home.“We have received several of our Bactrian camels over the years from them, and Shannon [Jensen] here has helped us transport a few brown bear cubs in the past to their zoo,” Lampi said Friday. “We trust them, and we’re very comfortable with this decision.”The five pups, two females and three males, will remain in the Alaska Zoo infirmary until their health has improved enough to be transported, reports Department of Fish and Game spokesman Ken Marsh. Zoo officials say the pups were left without food and water for several days during the fire until they were rescued, and suffered injuries from an encounter with a porcupine.“Really, their health is the driving factor behind the pups’ eventual transport,” Lampi said.Both the Department of Fish and Game and Alaska Zoo officials agree that keeping the pups together is important. Both zoos house their own family groups of wolves, something Lampi says has shown zoo officials the importance of maintaining pack structure for the well-being of its individuals.“It’s the companionship,” said Lampi. “They were born together in the wild and now they can grow up together. As long as they remain together, wherever they go is home.”No date has yet been set for the pups’ exodus while they recover, which could take more than a few weeks, according to Marsh. Once they are healthy enough, zoo officials will allow the public more visual access to the pups in the infirmary.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Find out what you can and cannot eat.<COL>iStock / ideabugByMayo Clinic News NetworkA gluten-free diet is a diet that excludes the protein gluten. Gluten is found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye).A gluten-free diet is used to treat celiac disease. Gluten causes inflammation in the small intestines of people with celiac disease. Eating a gluten-free diet helps people with celiac disease control their signs and symptoms and prevent complications.Initially, following a gluten-free diet may be frustrating. But with time, patience and creativity, you'll find there are many foods that you already eat that are gluten-free and you will find substitutes for gluten-containing foods that you can enjoy.The gluten-free diet is a treatment for celiac disease.Switching to a gluten-free diet is a big change and, like anything new, it takes some getting used to. You may initially feel deprived by the diet's restrictions. However, try to stay positive and focus on all the foods you can eat. You may also be pleasantly surprised to realize how many gluten-free products, such as bread and pasta, are now available. Many specialty grocery stores sell gluten-free foods. If you can't find them in your area, check with a celiac support group or go online.If you're just starting with a gluten-free diet, it's a good idea to consult a dietitian who can answer your questions and offer advice about how to avoid gluten while still eating a healthy, balanced diet.Allowed foodsMany healthy and delicious foods are naturally gluten-free:It's important to make sure that they are not processed or mixed with gluten-containing grains, additives or preservatives. Many grains and starches can be part of a gluten-free diet:Always avoidAvoid all food and drinks containing:Avoiding wheat can be challenging because wheat products go by numerous names. Consider the many types of wheat flour on supermarket shelves — bromated, enriched, phosphated, plain and self-rising. Here are other wheat products to avoid:Avoid unless labeled 'gluten-free'In general, avoid the following foods unless they're labeled as gluten-free or made with corn, rice, soy or other gluten-free grain:Certain grains, such as oats, can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing stages of production. For this reason, doctors and dietitians generally recommend avoiding oats unless they are specifically labeled gluten-free.You should also be alert for other products that you eat or that could come in contact with your mouth that may contain gluten. These include:Watch for cross-contaminationCross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with foods that contain gluten. It can happen during the manufacturing process, for example, if the same equipment is used to make a variety of products. Some food labels include a "may contain" statement if this is the case. But be aware that this type of statement is voluntary. You still need to check the actual ingredient list. If you're not sure whether a food contains gluten, don't buy it or check with the manufacturer first to ask what it contains.Cross-contamination can also occur at home if foods are prepared on common surfaces or with utensils that weren't thoroughly cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods. Using a common toaster for gluten-free bread and regular bread is a major source of contamination, for example. Consider what steps you need to take to prevent cross-contamination at home, school or work.No email address was supplied by.

The non-wood homes were either brick or stucco. The wood-sided homes were clad in a number of possible ways, the more common being lap siding, shingles or board and batten. As styles change, some types have come and gone, but many homes today are still sided using these time-tested materials.No email address was supplied by.

"She needs medication twice a day and they took her away from me now. Who's going to take care of her now? Who? Who's going to do it?"Authorities said there had been repeated failure to correct violations, including multiple bites and escapes, fencing and caging deficiencies, and feeding animals an improper diet.The animals were taken to a sanctuary in central Florida.Sipek starred as the title character in several Tarzan movies through 1972.

Recalled cases of beef from Wolverine Packing Company in Detroit were shipped to distributors for restaurant use in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.By Barb Besteni, Staff writerIn a television commercial for a popular fast food chain, a father and son sit on the living room couch as the dad prepares to teach his boy an important life -- how to eat a pizza. It's a rite of passage the boy will remember for the rest of his life.But if he plans to live a long and healthy life, he may want to chow down on a carrot stick or two while bonding with his buddies.Take a look at the recommendations for what men should be eating for optimal nutrition and to help prevent some of the diseases common to them.Men are generally larger and have a higher muscle to fat ratio than women. As a result, they also have higher protein and calorie requirements.Extra muscle gives men higher fat-burning abilities. But if high-fat foods are your fuel of choice, over time the belts in your closet will start to shrink.And so will your arteries.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(.pdf), your expanding waistline increases your risk for heart disease -- the #1 killer of both men and women in the United States -- and a host of other illnesses, including stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.In an effort to curb male bonding through high fat foods, the CDC even provides guidelines forwhat to eat during a Super Bowl party."Eat healthy before you go to the party so you won't be as likely to overindulge," it advises. If you're hosting people for any game, the guidelines suggest that while it's OK to offer the traditional pizza, wings and chips, you should also add some healthy snacks to the menu, including vegetables and carrot sticks.Because men weigh more than women, they also require more protein.The recommended daily allowance for protein for the average man is about 52 grams per day. That's roughly the equivalent of about 8 ounces of meat. Protein requirements increase if you're an athlete or are physically active.Here's the formula for determining your personal protein requirements. For every pound of your ideal body weight, you will need 0.36 grams of protein. The key here is the word ideal. If you're overweight, the extra pounds should not be factored into the equation.Doctors also caution against eating too much protein since low-carbohydrate/high protein diets may cause kidney problems through a process called ketosis. Ketosis is said to increase insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease.Monounsaturated fats such as olive oil or omega-3 fatty acids offer health benefits to both men and women. But studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a vegetable-based omega-3 found in canola and flaxseed oils, may increase the risk of prostate cancer, the third most common cause of death from cancer in men.ALA has also been found, however, to be good for the heart. For men with risk factors for heart problems the benefits of ALA may outweigh the risks. But those with risk factors for prostate cancer should get their omega-3 fatty acids from fish and vegetable fats from olive oil, according to the American Cancer Society.Studies have also linked eating large amounts of red meats or dairy products to an increased risk of prostate cancer.The Cancer Society says men need to eat five or more servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day, limit intake of red meats and dairy products, and maintain an active lifestyle and healthy weight.Although statistics show that about 80 percent of those suffering from osteoporosis are women, men are not completely immune from the disease.A high-calcium diet is a woman's primary protection against osteoporosis, but a high consumption of calcium from food or supplements in men -- more than 2,000 mg. per day -- has been linked to an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.Studies suggest that about 800 mg. of calcium per day will protect men from osteoporosis without increasing the risk of prostate cancer associated with high calcium consumption. A cup of milk, for example, contains about 315 mg. of calcium.Although there are some differences when it comes to the dietary needs of men and women, there's one common theme for both sexes, regardless of age, fitness or health: When in doubt, check with your doctor to find what's right for you.No email address was supplied by.

Find out what men should focus on.<COL>By Steve Thompson, Contributing writerSince men are built differently than women, they need to recognize that certain nutrients are more important for them than others.Some herbs, vitamins and other nutrients discussed can have a significant affect on the male body, increasing the efficiency of body functions while improving quality of life.Saw palmettowas first used in Europe but is gaining popularity in America, primarily for urinary and prostate problems. It is thought to specifically target the urinary tract for better health and efficiency, sometimes even shrinking the prostate, if it isn't enlarged because of cancer.Saw palmetto nutrients are also thought to help with other problems such as low libido and baldness, though its impact on those conditions is not substantiated. If you suffer from frequent urination, pain during urination or any prostate problems, 320 mg per day might help.Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is particularly important in men because it assists with muscular growth as well as adrenal problems. Taken in 50 mg doses, riboflavin can increase mental acuity, reduce dryness of the skin and promote healthy hair and fingernails.It also can help with insomnia and light sensitivity.Heart disease is a serious issue for men, which is why supplements are recommended to reduce the incidence of heart-related problems and increase the efficiency of the circulatory system.Fish oilis one of the most popular and most trusted supplements for guarding against heart disease, particularly for men. It contains essential omega-3 fatty acids that guard the heart and arteries. It also has been used to successfully supplement the treatment of heart disease.Zinchas been known to help prevent prostate cancer, increase sexual performance and relieve pain caused by prostate problems.A zinc deficiency will most certainly do the opposite, lowering the libido and increasing prostate symptoms. This is especially true when men have a genetic or environmental predisposition to such conditions.Zinc can be obtained in pill form, through a multivitamin or in foods such as oysters, fish, cashews and oatmeal.Vitamin Kalso belongs on the list of essential nutrients for men, especially for those over the age of 40.This is the age where lack of blood clotting can become a problem, leading to serious health issues such as aneurysms.Vitamin K works to enhance blood-clotting ability in the male body, decreasing the risks of serious health conditions. It also helps to reduce bruising from minor injuries.Copyright 2012, Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.No email address was supplied by.

"I was on my knees. I had my rock pick out because i was on a steep incline, and I smashed the cat in the head with it. He screamed, but he didn't let go."He raised his weapon again for another swing when the mama bear suddenly jumped in and tore the big cat off his backpack. After a 15-second battle, the cat ran off, and the bear ambled away, the Paradise Post reported.He suffered bite marks, scratches and bruises to his arm, but was otherwise uninjured, the Post reported."I'm 100-percent sure it did want to save my life," he told The Huffington Post. "We made eye contact. I'd seen the bears before and I know she knew who I was.Biggs told the Paradise Post he played patty-cake with and high-fived a cub in front of the mother last year.California Department of Fish and Game officials are skeptical of Biggs' story, but testing blood found on his backpack.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Just don't ask the local authorities to arrest you for breaking them or you're likely to get an even bigger laugh.<COL>iStock / zimmytwsIf there aren't enough rules to keep track of, each year brings even more new laws to follow.The question is will they stand up over time or join the ranks of since-forgotten laws that look quite silly today?While you can indeed find such obsolete or down-right dumb laws in old law books, many of the funniest examples that have grown to the point of legend online simply aren't true.For instance, you may have heard that Arizona has outlawed camel hunting, that Minnesota won't let you transport a duck on your head across state lines, or that you can't lasso a fish in Tennessee. All hilarious -- and all completely untrue.But we've rounded up five of the weirdest real laws you'll ever laugh at. Just don't ask the local authorities to arrest you for breaking them or you're likely to get an even bigger laugh.No. 5: Monsters must be licensed -- Urbana, Ill.This one has grown to legendary status online in various forms along the lines of "Monsters are not allowed inside the city limits of Urbana." But that's not entirely true: Monsters are allowed; they just need to be licensed.The basis for this strange city requirement can be found in an act from 1872, which states that "exhibitions of freaks of nature or monsters" staged for profit within city limits must first receive a license from the city clerk.Of course, if you were bringing a monster show to Urbana for charity, well, then no license required.In all seriousness, you have to applaud the forefathers of Urbana who had the vision to protect the east-central Illinois city from freely roaming monsters. After all, think of the all the damage Tokyo would have been spared if it had had the foresight to license Godzilla.No. 4: No tobacco, alcohol for park animals -- Dyersburg, Tenn.If you ever find yourself with time to kill in the western Tennessee town of Dybersburg, be sure to not contribute to the delinquency of a squirrel in the city's parks.That's because the city's code prohibits "giving an animal or bird tobacco, alcohol or another known noxious substance in city parks."One has to wonder at the origin of this one. What could have possibly been going on in this city of 18,000 that would inspire such a head-scratcher of a law?Maybe some people were all too willing to let crows and other wild birds bum cigarettes? Or perhaps there was a rash of people trying to string out rabbits on meth?Whatever the reason, it's just good to know that somebody's looking out for the sobriety of woodland animals in The Volunteer State.No. 3: Rural drivers must fire signal flares every mile -- PennsylvaniaAt one time these Pennsylvania "rules of the road" set up by the Farmer's Anti-Automobile society probably made pretty good sense.After all, with autos in the early part of the 20th century sharing country roads with the livestock, you couldn't be too safe, right?Thus, this requirement for drivers on rural roads outside of towns of at least 500 residents. After firing his (yes, HIS) rocket flare, the motorist was required to wait 10 minutes to ensure all livestock had been startled off the road.Not thoroughly amused yet? The rules also called for a motorist to pull off the road and cover his vehicle so as not to spook an approaching team of horses. And if the horses still were startled? Said motorist then had to "quickly and completely disassemble his motorized vehicle and hide such under the nearest brush or shrubbery."Ah, simpler times.No email address was supplied by.

One diet claims to offer something like that.<COL>iStock / MartiSaizBy Barbara A. Besteni, Contributing writerIn "Defending Your Life," a 1991 film starring Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks, the protagonists died and went to Judgment City, a kind of way station where it was decided if they would go on to the next level or go back for another life on Earth.In one scene, the two are seen gorging on platefuls of food. One of the perks of being dead, apparently, is eating all you want and not gaining an ounce. But you don't have to wait until the afterlife to eat more and weigh less.You can start by making a few simple changes to your diet.The concept of eating more to weigh less has been popular since the publication of "Eat More, Weigh Less: Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Losing Weight Safely While Eating Abundantly."If you're attracted because you think you'll be able to scarf down giant slices of cake, refined carbohydrates, ice cream and pints of beer, get ready for the bad news. That's not what this diet is about.While the catchy name is sure to have attracted hundreds in search of diet Nirvana, the reality is that the foods you eat and quality of the food is what helps you keep off the pounds, and the only magic formula for losing weight is to eat fewer calories than you burn.The body is a great mathematician. And it will forgive the 500 calories in your grande mocha choco-latte only if you find a way to burn them before the end of the day or you deprive yourself of something else to make up for the calories."I've been following this diet since I was in high school," says Linda Hopkins, a 5-foot-3-inch South Florida woman who looks more like one of her students than a 52-year-old math teacher. At 110 pounds, Hopkins says she can still fit into her prom dress.Good habits start early, she says."When I was growing up, there was always an abundance of fruits and vegetables at home," she says. "Don't get me wrong, I had my share of Twinkies and Good Humor ice cream. But because I was feeding my body good quality foods, it let me get away with the occasional bad sugar and white flour."Ornish's diet is simple: Eat large quantities of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grain breads and cereals, and the fruits and vegetables that Hopkins ate so much of as a child. Because the diet is high in fiber and volume, you fill up quickly. The high fiber also keeps you fuller longer.But perhaps the most important key to the success of this diet is that it requires you to eat complex carbohydrates, not ones with simple, processed sugars found in white bread, rice and pasta. Complex carbs don't cause spikes in your blood sugar levels. Because your blood sugar stays relatively stable, you won't find yourself battling sugar cravings an hour after a meal.The diet recommends eating the following whenever you're hungry: Beans and legumes, any kind of fruit, vegetables or whole grain foods.In each case, you need to read labels to make sure a food doesn't contain added sugar, or sugar disguised as fructose.You can eat as much of these foods as you want, as long as you stop when you are full, the diet says.Stopping when you're full is a key component. However, fans of the diet say this is easier to do than on most diets."I think it's because you get to eat a lot of filling foods on this diet. A bowl of whole wheat pasta and a salad fills me up pretty quickly. And the fact (that) the whole wheat pasta won't send my blood sugar crashing after an hour is an added bonus. I stay full a lot longer," Hopkins says.If you can't eliminate dairy from your diet entirely, you should choose the nonfat variety, but consume it in moderation.The strictest part of the diet is the recommendation that you avoid meat, fish, chicken, anything containing fat or oil, nuts, alcohol and commercially prepared foods with more than 2 grams of fat.Hopkins, however, says this is one part of the diet she doesn't follow. She doesn't feel guilty about it."If I had to live without a filet mignon and a glass or two of merlot once in a while, life would not be worth living," she laughs. "Guilt leads to deprivation, which eventually leads to throwing your hands up and forgetting all about healthy eating."No email address was supplied by.

He was recently hired by his hometown of Aniak, but a major facet of his job could soon change if the legislature approves a bill allowing native associations to arm VPSOs."I'd love to do the firearms training," Kvamme said. "I think it's another tool we would have available to us, but I'd hate to have to use it."There are 90 VPSOs spread across rural villages and towns, places State Troopers can't necessarily get to on short notice.The idea to arm VPSOs came after officer Thomas Madole was killed on March 19th, 2013, while responding to a disturbance at a home in Manokotak, a South Yukon Delta village in state Rep. Bryce Edgmon's (D-Dillingham) legislative district.Days after Madole was slain, Edgmon went back home and after talking with VPSOs, proposed a bill to allow them to carry guns."I had the opportunity for about a half hour to hear their personal and up close stories about what it's like to be a law enforcement officer in the bush, and not be armed," Edgmon said. "What I heard made my skin crawl."If Edgmon's bill passes, the Department of Public Safety would add additional firearms instruction to an already intense training schedule."There is going to be disciplines, judgment disciplines," said Capt. Steve Arlow. "How to be able to manipulate the firearm properly under stress, and be able to perform under stress, and score to a certain level."This is Arlow's eighth year of heading up the VPSO training program. Trainees are sequestered at the Sitka training facility day and night, as they prepare for the life of a lone law enforcement officer in rural Alaska."The Village Public Safety Officer is not just a law enforcement component. There are search and rescue duties, there's EMS duties," Arlow said. "They have firefighting and they have a lot of involvement in community policing."VPSOs are also put through a rigorous obstacle course, wilderness survival training and even hand-to-hand combat.For James Kvamme, the prospect of being armed is not new for him. He's a former municipal police officer and Coast Guardsman, but he knows carrying a gun isn't the be-all, end-all to problems that may surface in rural Alaska."It's just another tool that we have on our tool belt," Kvamme said. "It doesn't make me feel any more secure or less secure about the job that we do, just because of the relationship that we have in villages and the rapport that we have with people."Edgmon's bill cleared the State Affairs committee Tuesday, and heads to the House Finance Committee, before being heard on the house floor.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But even amid an unseasonably warm winter, travel along the frozen river – by four-wheeler, snow machine and truck – remains one of the most common transportation methods.The original plan was to touch down in the Western Alaska hub then swap to a smaller airplane headed to Nunapitchuk for a story on village public safety officers, but the mechanical gods had another idea: an early-morning Alaska Airlines flight turned back to Anchorage due to busted landing gear, and another problem kept mechanics pecking away at an idle replacement airplane for hours.Monday was done by the time I arrived in Bethel, so Tuesday morning, we headed to the office of the Association of Village Council Presidents, a tribal nonprofit that oversees the state's largest village public safety officer program. AVCP provides services to a land area roughly the size of Oregon and currently employs VPSO officers in 19 communities.Alvin Jimmie is director of the organization's VPSO program."Maybe you could have made it in a plane yesterday," he says. "Maybe not. It was windy."In any case, Jimmie says he plans a trip upriver to Akiak with his colleague William Kanuk so the two can check on a newly-minted officer who just completed the second tier of training at a state-run academy in Sitka.The Ford F-150 they drive has plenty of room for a couple extra, so they offer a ride. I sit in the back seat alongside the longest-serving VPSO in the state, Max Olick, who is hitching a ride to his hometown of Kwethluk.As we drive along the road, the sound of water slapping beneath the ice is occasionally audible in the cab of the truck. Whenever the sun shimmers, branches of golden light glint along cracks that start and end somewhere out of sight."How thick is the ice?""It's getting thicker now," Jimmie says. "18 inches – maybe two feet.""What are they doing with those sticks?"Kanuk explains that some of the clusters of wooden sticks mark ice fishing spots carved and checked daily, while others are put out to mark open water and dangerously thin ice. He says it is rare for vehicles to fall through, but one recently went for an unexpected swim not far from the stretch of road we are traveling.Flight-related delays and a ride along a soggy river may be the perfect beginning to a trek into rural Alaska to explore why there is a push to allow VPSOs to carry firearms and what it would mean for villages.Not long after the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlements Act in 1971, with new wealth trickling into villages, regional Native associations like AVCP started asking and answering recurring questions that laid the groundwork for the VPSO program:Who in remote communities can be counted on during search and rescue missions to organize operations and make sure helpers avoid becoming additional victims?When someone runs afoul of the law and armed officers are in faraway places, who can make the most of a bad situation until backup arrives?What if another emergency arises and help is a grounded flight or a mushy river away?“If a situation arrives, we are ready,” says Michael Hoffman, vice president of AVCP, sitting inside a Bethel conference room.Hoffman’s family has distant ties to Western Alaska – “all the way back to the beginning, until the end” – and he says the VPSO program provides another service that is often overlooked.“If a trooper comes in, you have a person that knows the families, that knows everyone living in the villages, someone that knows the language,” Hoffman says.VPSO Thomas Madole Fatally Shot'THINGS HAVE CHANGED'While the VPSO program is lauded by many rural community leaders, a recent tragedy left many people wondering why most of the officers are not allowed to carry firearms.One afternoon last March, the lone VPSO serving Manokotak was fatally shot.Thomas Madole, 54, was responding to reports of an argument involving a family that escalated when a man slapped his stepfather in the face.Leroy B. Dick, Jr., the 42-year-old stepson, was reportedly suicidal when Madole was called in to try and diffuse the situation.Madole brought a baton, handcuffs, pepper spray and a Taser – the standard tools issued to a VPSO – to what proved to be a gunfight. The VPSO made his way to the house in question and knocked on the door and knocked again. He tried to convince Dick to come outside peacefully, to step away without making a bad decision.Dick eventually stepped outside, and he fired multiple .223-caliber rounds from a rifle as Madole turned his back and tried in vain to get away.A bullet hit Madole in the head, and others hit his abdomen, chest and thigh. He was dead when armed troopers arrived.The death marked the second time in the history of the program that an officer was killed in the line of duty. Ronald Eugene Zimin, a former Naknek VPSO, was 36-years-old when he was shot dead while responding to a report of domestic violence.In hearing the stories surrounding the officers’ tragic deaths, a common question arises: Why would a VPSOnothave a gun?Max Olick, the Kwethluk VPSO, has never carried a gun on the job since assuming his role in 1981. And he never much liked the bulletproof vest adorned by most of his colleagues, so it usually hangs somewhere in the community’s public safety building.“Arming VPSOs, I’m for it, but I’ve got mixed feelings,” Olick says. “Things have changed. The people have changed.“Maybe it’s time.”EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a two-part KTUU.com series.

But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies.<COL>(NewsUSA) - Exercise improves health at any age. But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies."Weekend warriors and boomers are more susceptible to injury because oftentimes they are not keeping themselves physically prepared," says Dr. Anne Meyer, whose private practice in West Los Angeles, Calif., focuses on sports rehabilitation.Physical activities can strain ligaments and muscles, and damage joints. Falls and overexertion can injure aging exercisers. But boomers don't have to exchange outdoor fun for weekends spent channel surfing.With a few steps, exercisers can stay both active and healthy. According to Meyer, exercising and stretching three times a week can help prepare boomers' bodies for active weekends.Simple stretching before and after exercise can help prevent injury. Boomers should always include warm-ups and cool-downs in their workout routines. Nutrition also helps the body recover from exercise. Limiting processed foods and consuming more fresh fruits, vegetables and high-quality proteins encourages the body to build healthy new tissues."Tissues are constantly being renewed. Sometimes what you remove from your diet is more important than what you add. Artificial sweeteners should be eliminated," Meyer advises. "To keep hydrated, exercisers need to drink water often. Eating a small amount every four hours can boost metabolism and keep bodies energized during exercise. Weekend warriors with arthritis may want to avoid citrus, which can aggravate arthritic symptoms. Fish oils are a good addition to help decrease inflammation."If an injury occurs, boomers should rest, apply ice, elevate an injured arm or leg, and consider treating pain with topical agents.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"I pinch myself all the time. I'm a starving theater mouse from Chicago who spent 10 years selling books and writing plays and living on tuna fish. So to have all of this happen has been incredible. The directors I've worked with inspired me before, and still inspire me."Logan's nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for "Hugo" is one of the film's leading 11 Academy Award nominations, which also includes Best Picture and Best Director for Scorsese. Many of Logan's collaborators on "The Aviator" -- which was also nominated for 11 Oscars (and won five) in 2005 -- are also nominated for "Hugo.""One of the very special things about 'Hugo' was that it reunited a bunch of us who worked on 'The Aviator' with Marty -- (cinematographer) Bob Richardson, (art director) Dante Ferretti, (visual effects artist) Rob Legato, (editor) Thelma Schoonmaker -- it's like we're the traveling band of Scorsese players," Logan enthused. "It's like seeing old friends, I tell you. It's fantastically fun."Even though "Hugo" is Logan's third Oscar nomination, the scribe said that getting the getting another nod doesn't make the honor any less exciting. In fact, Logan added, he's more jazzed than ever before."It definitely never becomes old hat. The thing that I've always liked about it is that it gives me a chance to meet other people in the industry. I get to meet writers whom I've always admired, directors, actors and producers. It gives you a chance to mix with your colleagues and rub shoulders with them. That never gets old," Logan said. "Having been through it a couple of times before, it makes it a little bit easier. You know how to pace yourself and all your expectations put everything into a nice, little perspective. But it's still thrilling. The important thing to remember is, it's not your day job. My day job is writing, and this is a fun little extra."Logan penned three films in 2011 total -- "Hugo," the Best Animated Feature nominee "Rango" and an adaptation of Shakespeare's "Coriolanus" (which marked the directorial debut of Ralph Fiennes) -- and it was a year of departure for the writer in that the first two skewed more toward a family audience. While it was completely happenstance he was writing for that genre for the first time, Logan said he's glad for the opportunity to spread his wings a bit."I'm drawn to material because there are stories I want to tell or people I want to work with, and 'Hugo' and 'Rango' just happened to be projects that were really exciting," Logan said. "I like doing things that are departures anyway, whether it goes from doing 'The Aviator' to 'Sweeney Todd,' or 'Coriolanus' to 'Rango,' I like doing things that are different. I like being challenged and flex different muscles."Based on author Brian Selznick's award-winning children's book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret," "Hugo" is about an orphaned 12-year-old boy (Asa Butterfield) who lives within the walls of a Paris train station, collecting gears and other assorted bits to finish construction of an automaton that he believes will contain a message from his late father (Jude Law) but instead thrusts Hugo into a series of events that the boy never could have imagined.Logan said that he and Scorsese were looking for a film to work on together since "The Aviator," and he knew almost instantly that they found the project when the director sent him a copy of Selznick's book."I think Brian Selznick wrote a masterpiece. Within 10 pages I knew why Marty wanted to do it as a film and I knew I wanted to do it," Logan said. "It's such a mesmerizing story. How could I not want to go back into that world and get to explore a little Charles Dickens. I always looked at 'Hugo' as being a little Dickensian. It gave me a chance to explore those tropes, characters and themes that have affected me from so many years of reading Dickens."As a screenwriter who has both written original and adapted material, Logan said he was particularly fascinated with "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" because he simply could not see where the story was going. What he found even more fascinating was, that in addition to the story of the orphan, tucked neatly into the nooks and crannies of the story was an emerging plotline about Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), whose pioneering work as a filmmaker had all but been forgotten."On one level, Brian Selznick's book is a mystery story and you're never sure where it's going, from all the twists and turns that lead you from Hugo and his relationship with his father, to the automaton and the people in the train station," Logan observed.  "Then finally, you follow the story to Melies and it ends up with the great irony of good storytelling, being in the place that Hugo needs to go to find his own home.  It was very satisfying because the story is so thematically joined, because all the characters in one way or another are very damaged -- and by the end of the story they're made whole again through the efforts of this incredibly brave kid."Naturally, Logan said he cherished the opportunity to write a script for Scorsese again, and better yet, he spent more time on the "Hugo" set than the norm because he was already in London working on the script for the upcoming James Bond film "Skyfall." Lucky for Logan, it allowed him the opportunity to see a different side of the legendary director that he didn't get to see while working on "The Aviator.""The difference between Marty on 'The Aviator' and Marty on 'Hugo' was notable. 'Hugo' was an act of benevolence. It was very grateful film that he made," Logan said. "He was so warm and generous on the set. He's always inspiring and thrilling to work with, but there was a little something special about this time. It was like watching a magician in the autumn of his years, really using all his powers to create a magnificent work of magic."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Use these tips.<COL>(NewsUSA) - As you may know, heart disease is the number-one killer of both men and women in the United States, and it imposes astronomical costs on our health care system -- approximately $258 billion in 2006 when accounting for health care services, medications and lost productivity. So, what can you do in your day-to-day life to keep your heart healthy?Here are 10 tips from the Weight-control Information Network you should take to heart:* Measure up. Take time to measure your waist circumference. If it measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, your risk of developing heart disease is increased.* Be active. Incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity, physical activity into your day. And don't worry, you don't have to do it all at once. For example, take the stairs or get off the bus or subway one stop early so you can walk the rest of the way.* Stick together. Walk, jog or take an exercise class with a friend or a group. You can cheer each other on, have company while you work out and feel safe when you are outdoors.* Eat right. Make a healthy eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. It should also include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts.

Sadly, it’s a story all too common, but she hopes to change that.<COL>A child in Tanana, wearing an official Iron Dog race marshal's vest, waits patiently for the incoming flood of racers stopping in town.When 54 Iron Dog snow machine racers showed up at Cynthia Erickson’s home in Tanana, the longtime caretaker had more in mind for the racers than the usual raceway room and board.Erickson is the volunteer leader of the 4-H program in Tanana, which brings attention to the impact suicide, substance abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault has had on local youth. It’s a story all too common, but Erickson hopes to change that.The mother of three has faced suicide in her village head-on. She watched children in Tanana grow up only to cut their lives off early. She’s taken her stories before the Alaska State Legislature.Having more than 50 Iron Dog racers in Tanana presented Erickson with a unique opportunity to impress upon the village’s youth, speaking in personal terms on how drug and alcohol abuse can affect anyone -- even those Iron Dog heroes kids admire so much.“It’s like a bunch of NASCAR racers just came through,” Erickson said. “I always tell (the racers), ‘I’ll do the introduction, but this is your story.'"(Cynthia Erickson is surrounded by children inside the Tanana School District auditorium.)After racing for hours on end, one by one the racers filed into the Tanana School District auditorium to listen to Erickson. She talked about how substance abuse and suicide had affected her town, much the same way she did when she spoke on the issue in October 2013 at theFirst Alaskans Institute Elders & Youth Conference. Instead of hearing from each of the kids about their experiences coping with substance abuse and suicide, Erickson turned the spotlight on the racers.Racers likeGux Laraux of BethelandChris Olds of Eagle Rivershared their experiences dealing with the loss of loved ones' lives cut short by suicide. The racers stressed the importance of communication and providing support, even if it isn’t wanted by a person struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.Micah Huss, an Iron Dog crewmember who grew up in Kotzebue, lost his sister when she took her own life at a young age. There isn’t a day that goes by where Huss wonders if there was something different he could have done to reach his sister before it was too late, he said.“There are signs,” Huss told the crowd. “There are always signs.”Like Erickson, Huss believes it’s important to engage children at an early age, regardless of the environment in which they are raised. But for those children raised in an environment plagued by substance abuse and violence, it’s vital to show them there is more to life than what they see at home -- and offer them a positive outlet.“There aren’t many things for the kids to do in the villages, so that is a very real problem,” Huss said. “If there were more community activities, more programs, that would help children do other things but (drink and do drugs), when you don’t have anything else in town to do, that seems like the only thing to do and everyone else is doing it, and that’s the lifestyle.”Huss said it’s not just a matter of noticing signs, but also doing something about them.“We need to be more aware of what’s happening in these communities and not just shy away from it,” he said.(Kids from Tanana and a group of Iron Dog racers pause for a photo opportunity.)Erickson said the story isn’t uncommon, whether in a rural community or in the middle of major metropolis: For every family that deals with drug and alcohol abuse, there is a child that quietly struggles to come to terms with that reality. Children who wake up in the middle of the night to the sounds of alcohol-fueled violence or abuse know what is happening, but not how to make sense of it.The rural difference, Erickson points out, is that when suicide and substance abuse impacts a community of fewer than 400 residents, the collateral damage is felt throughout the entire village. Perhaps it is that ubiquity that exasperates Erickson and her husband Dale the most.Alaska’s rate of self-inflicted deaths was second most nationally only behind Wyoming, according to2010 national comparative datacompiled by Alaska’s Department of Health and Social Services and its Epidemiology Section. The research provides the most recent data available.From 2003 to 2010, Alaska’s age-adjusted rate for suicide was almost twice the national average -- 21.6 vs. 11.3 deaths per 100,000 persons per year, according to the study. The study reports suicide was the sixth leading cause of death in Alaska and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15 to 24 years of age in 2010.The study further suggests Alaska’s rate of suicide increases the farther north a community is located; however, researchers could not officially conclude why.It’s easy for one to get lost by the fact these statistic are simply numbers on a piece of paper. But for those these statistics reflect, the numbers come with a name and a face – the name of a brother, a sister, a mother, a father or simply just a friend.Those faces and those names in Tanana haunt Cynthia to this day. She remembers watching those faces grow and mature; watching them falter and watching them succeed. She also remembers a man’s face (or what was left of it) she couldn’t hope or want to forget – the one she wrapped in linen so she wouldn’t have to look at what had happened to it again.These statistics contrast the environment Cynthia was used to when she was growing up in Ruby.“Things have changed: Life was harder; it was very simple; we didn’t have what we have now,” she said. “People were busting butt; they were hauling wood; they were packing water; they were fishing; they were trapping.”Essentially they didn’t have time to despair or abuse the bottle as much, she said, because there was work to be done, and everyone needed to chip in.“You had to put the food on the table, so there was no partying and fooling around,” she said. “There was no loss of hope; we had a mission and if you didn’t fill that wood box, you were going to get in trouble.”Erickson figures it was some time in the 1970s when she started to see the “breakdown.”“You started seeing government subsidies come in,” Erickson said. “People built their homes – it wasn’t given to them.”Money was needed for infrastructure -- schools, city municipalities, public services, etc. – but Erickson believes that dependency upon the government will shift again, that a renaissance of sorts could return those living in rural villages back to relying upon themselves to build their homes and nurture that self-reliance she grew up with.Back home in Tanana, Cynthia is preparing a veritable feast for the Iron Dog racers. At her side is a 5-year-old girl Cynthia nicknamed Bitsy Boo. Cynthia has been toiling inside the always-open kitchen all day, preparing dinners, breakfasts and all sorts of in-between snacks. This night, as the racers settle in, pulled pork sandwiches are on the menu; the night before, it was spaghetti. There are also six turkeys roasting.Bitsy Boo is helping in the kitchen folding napkins and doing “gopher” work – “go for this and go for that.” Bitsy Boo was adopted as a baby by a friend of Cynthia’s in Tanana, and together, they have helped raise the child – as a family.The Ericksons would sooner give Bitsy Boo and children like her in Tanana a job or teach them a trade, if for no other reason than to engage their minds. For Bitsy Boo and others like her, it's not too late.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But pain is nothing compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.<COL>iStock / amaximSince the beginning of time, people have been willing to try just about anything to make themselves feel younger, look more attractive and be more appealing to potential mates.Women seem especially willing to forgo comfort for beauty. From plucking their eyebrows, to cramming their size 10 feet into size 6 shoes, to having fat sucked out of their body through a giant tube, women seem willing to make whatever sacrifices necessary to look their best.Beauty rituals have always been associated with some measure of physical pain. But pain seems like a welcome vice compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.What has the world come to when people are willing to bask in disgustingness just to clear their pores or condition their hair? Apparently (and frighteningly) it has come to this ...No. 5: Bird poop facialEver wonder how those beautiful Geisha women maintain such smooth and vibrant skin? Well, it doesn't come from your typical moisturizer or mud mask.Apparently, nightingale excrement is the secret ingredient in the Geisha facial, and celebrities all over the world have adopted the practice of putting dried bird poop on their faces in the name of beauty. In fact, at the New York City Shizuka Day Spa, you can have bird poop rubbed on your face for as little as $180!While it is true that you can get birds to poop on your car for free, the face is a much smaller target. You would have to stand outside looking up at the sky for hours -- even days -- before you got your whole face covered.But go to the spa and shell out a couple of C-notes and you can be guaranteed to have your face completely saturated with bird droppings while investing only an hour of your time. Who knew?Of course, if you think that's weird, check this out ...No. 4: Sheep placentaIt turns out that sheep placenta -- yes, the afterbirth of a sheep -- can give you clearer, younger looking skin.Whether it is rubbed on the skin as a cream or consumed orally in capsule form, experts (and celebrities like Denise Richards) swear by its beautifying effects.Allegedly, by nourishing your skin with sheep placenta, you will be able to rid yourself of unsightly blemishes and create a luminous glow from head to toe. Not only that, you'll supposedly look years younger.But then again, you are doing this by using a sheep's afterbirth, so, you know, we're just saying. If the gross-out factor doesn't bother you though, then by all means go right ahead and slap some of that sheep placenta all over your body. Who knows, maybe it will actually work.But we wouldn't make any bets about this next beauty ritual paying off ...No. 3: Fish pedicureNothing will keep you on your toes like a good old-fashioned fish pedicure. How does that work? Well, essentially, you place your tootsies into a big bucket of little fish and allow them to nibble away at your dead and dry skin cells until they have had their fill.Why is this better than the typical method of removing dry skin for a pedicure? Well according to John Ho, a salon owner in Alexandria, Va., who first brought the fishy pedicures to America from China, it is unique and more sanitary.Unique? We will definitely give you that one. Sanitary? More like sanitarium. This is just a crazy way to get a pedicure -- and there does not seem to be a whole lot of advantages to it either.Plus, what about those poor fish forced to eat people's nasty, stinky feet? You gotta feel bad for the fish.But don't feel bad for people who are whacked out enough to try this next beauty ritual ...No email address was supplied by.

Everyone would probably agree that we always want to save money and we always want to eat healthy.But take a look around the grocery store, and you quickly come to a reasonable conclusion: It's cheaper to chow down on a box of Ding Dongs than eat a bag of salad.True, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but let's be honest: We all know it's better for you to eat apples and oranges than Ding Dongs (with all due respect to the good people at Hostess).But eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. You can transfer that excess weight from your belly to your wallet by making some simple changes.No. 5: Switch to tap waterNo one could possibly argue that a can of soda is healthier than a bottle of water. Obviously, the healthier choice is water. But it isn't just health that matters. Some 12 packs of soda can cost as much as $5.Bottled water might seem like a good alternate, but it is still very pricey, and you're really not doing yourself any nutritional favors.Bottled water comes from the same sources as municipal water, meaning it just comes from someone else's tap.

Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day.

Not only does a flier probably come in your Sunday paper (if you still get one), you can find them at the front door of the store.If you're an Interweb type (you are reading this online, after all), your local grocery store probably has its current ad online.The point is this: Use those ads, and not just to find out if barbecue chips are cheaper this week than sour cream and onion. Find out which fruits, vegetables and lean meats are on sale.While you might have always bought the same things, check the ads and step outside of your comfort zone. Maybe you always buy fish sticks. This week, if halibut is on sale, give some of that a try.No. 3: Eat more eggsBreakfast is the most important meal of the day. At least so says every diet book, website or episode of "Oprah" we've ever laid eyes on. But if it's so important, why are we digging into a giant bowl of Supr Frooty Oats-n-Marshmallowz every morning? Because they are easy to make and they taste really, really good.A better option is found under your local chicken.Eggs are loaded with vitamins and protein, and cost around a dollar a dozen.But won't eggs jack your cholesterol to the moon and lead to your untimely death? No. While eggs take a bad rap for hurting your cholesterol levels, they are not tied to blood cholesterol.And eggs aren't just for breakfast. Nowhere does it say that you can't scramble up a bunch for dinner.No email address was supplied by.

But did you know that there's a delicious powerhouse food that's easy to make and won't break your wallet?"Fresh mussels are packed with important health benefits. They are rich in nutrients without adding calories or fat to meals. This makes them perfect for people who aim to live a life of fitness and health," explains registered dietitian Lois Ferguson.Fresh mussels deliver vitamins and minerals like phosphorus, zinc, manganese, folate, niacin, riboflavin and thiamine. In fact, mussels offer more iron and vitamin B12 than beef, and more vitamin C than some fruits. And unlike beef or pork, blue cultured mussels are low in saturated fat but high in protein."This makes mussels a great choice for entrées as there's an abundance of delicious ingredients to combine with them to make healthy meals for family and friends," says Ferguson. "Mussels are every bit as versatile as shrimp, for instance, but mussels have only one-third the amount of cholesterol."A common expression says seafood is "brain food," and research shows that long-chain omega-3 fats in our diet benefit the brain, eyes and nerves. Ferguson notes that mussels are similar in nutritional value to meaty fish, like halibut.Mussels are also an excellent source of selenium, both a mineral and antioxidant often thought to be solely in the realm of fruits and vegetables. The dietary antioxidant helps the formation of proteins that defend against oxidative stress.Enjoy a nutrient-rich meal with this Thai mussel recipe:SWEET THAI MUSSELS4 pounds fresh PEI mussels4 ounces white wine2 teaspoons red onions, finely chopped6 tablespoons sweet chili sauce4 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantroOne-half lime squeezedRinse fresh PEI mussels in cold water. Tap any mussels that are still open. Discard any mussels that remain open.Place mussels in a sauté pan, adding wine, red onions, sweet chili sauce, cilantro and lime. Cover pan and allow to steam until mussels start to open up.Sauté the pan occasionally to ensure the chili sauce coats all the mussels. Discard any mussels that do not open.Serve mussels in large oval bowl with your favorite bread for dipping.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Two vessels, the 36-foot Miss Jana and the 50-foot Equinox, were in the area.“Sector Anchorage issued an urgent marine information broadcast and the crew of the Miss Jana responded to the scene, rescuing the three men from the water,” officials wrote. “Shortly after embarking the men, the crew of the Miss Jana reported engine problems and transferred the men to the nearby fishing vessel Equinox. The Equinox took the Miss Jana in tow.”A Valdez-based 45-foot Coast Guard response boat met the Equinox, taking the rescued men aboard and transferring them to Valdez for medical treatment.“The Coast Guard appreciates the vigilance and assistance of Alaska’s professional mariners,” Jimmy Belcher, Sector Anchorage command center operations unit controller, said in the statement. “With the help of the crew from the fishing vessels Miss Jana and Equinox, these three men are now safe on land and will be able to go home to their families.”The Belltech 5 reportedly went down in 1,200 feet of water, in three-foot seas with winds at 7 mph and snow in the area. The Coast Guard’s Marine Safety Unit Valdez is monitoring the site for signs of pollution with none seen so far, and investigating the cause of the sinking.Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 3rd Class Jonathan Klingenberg says the Belltech 5's entire crew was rescued. He didn't have immediate information Wednesday about when or where the sinking occurred, or the condition of the rescued men."It wasn't too far from port," Klingenberg said. "We handed them off to emergency medical services as soon as we pulled into port."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The next day, both had signs of antifreeze poisoning when they were brought to the Pet’s Choice Veterinary Clinic, where they subsequently died. Sitka police gave the case to Alaska Wildlife Troopers on Oct. 16.An investigation showed that Taranoff, an employee of the golf course, acted without knowledge or consent of colleagues or superiors when he left the poisoned food near the Sea Mountain Restaurant, in an attempt to kill brown bears which had been roving on the course.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They dream that one day they will become self-made millionaires with the help of a special idea developed in their basements or garages.Many of the big million-dollar (or billion-dollar) ideas of this generation are related to technology, from Apple and Microsoft to Google, from MySpace and YouTube to Facebook.Still, this doesn't rule out simple hands-on ingenuity for becoming a self-made millionaire. Here's a small sampling of million-dollar ideas, past and present.Great Depression Basic: Spic and SpanThe problem with economic hard times is that even if an inventor comes up with a million-dollar idea, who's going to buy it? A foursome in Saginaw, Mich., addressed this dilemma during the beginning of the Great Depression in 1930. They realized that no matter how dire poverty may become, families still needed to clean their houses.Harold and Naomi Stenglein, together with Glenn and Elizabeth McDonald, wondered how they possibly could make ends meet. One day the women were talking about the drudgery of washing walls. The first pass with soapy water imparted scum. The second pass of clear hot water produced streaks, so yet a third dry wipe was required.Elizabeth McDonald noticed that a relative had melted some paste glue into the wash water. This produced clean results, except the whole house stank. The two couples started experimenting with various combinations until they came up with a no-rinse, no-wipe mix of three elements: sodium phosphate for deep cleaning; powdered glue to absorb the scum; and sodium carbonate to prevent the glue from hardening, and to remove the odor.Door-to-door peddling in Saginaw evolved into local, regional and eventually nationwide sales. According to Public Libraries of Saginaw archives, the Stengleins and the McDonalds in 1945 sold Spic and Span to Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati for $1.9 million.Baby Boomer Toy: SlinkyRichard James of Philadelphia was doing his World War II duty on the home front in 1943 as a Navy tool worker in Philadelphia. He observed a torsion spring coil fall from a workshop table and take several "steps" before coming to a stop.Normally, this would have been simply another moment in time, but James apparently was a child at heart, because he immediately saw the idea for a toy. He spent two years testing various gauges of steel, according to the Lemelson-MIT Program Web site, striving to find the ideal material and length that would cause his coil to march down one stairway step to the next.His wife, Betty, came up with the term "Slinky," Swedish for sleek and sinuous. The couple produced 400 units and took them to a Gimbel's department store to sell for $1 each during the postwar Christmas season of 1945. The stock was gone within 90 minutes. More than 250 million units later, everyone still knows the Slinky.Infomercial Innovator: Ron PopielScores of inventors have capitalized their million-dollar ideas via the TV infomercial, and the pioneer is Ron Popeil of the ubiquitous Ronco Inc.Ron Popiel's father, Samuel Popiel, was marketing the Chop-O-Matic (forerunner of the Veg-O-Matic) door-to-door in New York City during the 1950s. However, salesmen had trouble carrying enough veggies for demonstrations, so charismatic young Ron Popeil hosted a videotape demonstration. Through telemarketing, Chop/Veg-O-Matic went on to sell millions at an original price of $3.98.Ron Popeil wasn't a man with just one million-dollar idea. Through the years came products such as the Pocket Fisherman ("biggest fishing invention since the hook"), Mr. Microphone, the Smokeless Ash Tray, and finally, the Showtime Rotisserie ("set it and forget it").Not all of his ideas were hits. GLH-9 Hair in a Can Spray didn't get far; neither did the container-opening Cap Snaffler. Nonetheless, Ron Popeil was already a multimillionaire four years ago when he sold Ronco for another cool $55 million.Green Invention: Java LogRod Sprules of Ottawa, Ontario, was a thirty-something mechanical engineer during the mid-1990s when he spotted a short magazine article about coffee, according to NationalGeographic.com. The article explained how ground coffee beans burn with surprisingly intense heat. The topic was preparation of great-tasting coffee, not home heating, but Sprules jotted a note in his "idea book."Months later, Sprules felt inspired to mix dried, recycled coffee grounds with some wax, and he lit the mixture. Viola! This sparked his idea for what eventually became the Java Log, a one-of-a-kind artificial fireplace log. Sprules' Java Log not only produces a larger flame than comparable products, but it emits 85 percent less harmful carbon dioxide than firewood, according to reports from sources ranging from The New York Times to Entrepreneur Magazine.Sprules started by selling his product to family and friends, and never looked back. Profits first exceeded $1 million in 2003, and sales of Java Logs still are catching fire.Copyright Internet Broadcasting.

Such as these five examples.<COL>Adam Ciesielski/SXCIt goes without saying that cancer is a horrible disease. But there's some good news: We're surviving more often than not. In fact according to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for all cancers diagnosed between 1999 and 2006 was 68 percent, up from 50 percent between 1975 and 1977.The organization attributes this to progress in early diagnosis and treatment.But another good way to improve your odds against cancer is to recognize what you are doing -- and what's in your environment -- that could putting you at a higher risk for cancer.Not to be alarmist, but the things we do every day, and take for granted, might increase your risk for different cancers. You don't have to totally change your life and go live in a tent in the woods, but there are some things to be cognizant of that can help you, starting with where you live ...No. 5: Where you liveThe term "cancer cluster" is a name given by epidemiologists and public health workers to describe an area where multiple people have all developed cancer. The concern is even more pronounced when those people all have the same type of cancer.Cancer clusters occur in places where environmental factors make them more likely. For instance, they are often seen around power lines or where toxic waste has been improperly disposed of.Of course, if a power plant's neighbors suddenly develop the same type of cancer, the neighbors might assume that the power plant is the source of the trouble. But the power plant owners would be eager to point to stacks of research and documentation -- bolstered by subsequent investigation by health officials -- showing that their company couldn't possibly be the source of trouble.No matter who is right, being near a cancer cluster might be cause to consider moving.But wherever you move, you're still going to have to deal with dirt. Which brings us to our next risk ...No. 4: RadonMost of our homes have radon detectors. It's sort of a chic domestic thing these days, and they give us a sense of security. But what do you do it the detector goes off? And what is radon, anyway?The No. 2 cause of lung cancer doesn't come from something like burning tires or wearing bad cologne. It comes from an unlikely source -- the ground beneath your feet.Radon is a gas that occurs in the ground and then permeates through your basement to affect your home. It occurs naturally, so it's not something that you can blame on the neighborhood strychnine factory.Radon is something that you can test for. A kit costs about $20, and you can install a radon alarm that can help sniff out trouble. What do you do if radon is detected? A radon remediation system costs between $1,000 and $2,000.No. 3: Overcooking meatIf you watch cooking shows, preparing a steak or burger well done causes the chefs to curl their noses in disgust. While that sentiment is food snobby, there is some health logic behind it. There is evidence to support the statement that overcooking meat can increase the risk of cancer, according to theNational Cancer Institute.Science time: The culprit seems to be heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These chemicals are formed when meat -- including beef, pork, fish and poultry -- are cooked using high-temperatures, like pan frying or grilling over an open flame.This doesn't mean you have to go vegan, wear hemp and change your name to Moonbeam.According to the National Cancer Institute, HCA and PAH formation can be mitigated by avoiding direct exposure of meat to an open flame or a hot metal surface. If also helps if you reduce cooking time and use a microwave oven to partially cook the meat before you take it to high temperature sources.Once you've eaten all that tasty grilled meat, you might want to work it off ...Breast cancer patients may go weeks without seeing a doctor. Technology can help them stay in touch.Sign up for Breaking News, Daily Headlines, Severe Weather Alerts & more!No email address was supplied by.

The reports could not be independently verified.<COL>Sirte falls to anti-Gadhafi fightersConflicting reports surfaced Thursday that deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is dead or has been captured. Deafening celebrations erupted in Tripoli, but none of the reports could be independently verified.Gadhafi's death was reported by National Transitional Council television station Al-Ahrar. It did not cite a source. Gadhafi's capture was also reported by Libyan television, citing the Misrata Military Council.A National Transitional Council military spokesman told CNN that reports of Gadhafi's capture are only rumors.A "big fish" has been captured in Libya, but Libyan Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam couldn't say with certainty whether it was Gadhafi.Abdurahman Bousin, the NTC spokesman, added that it's doubtful that Gadhafi was even in or around his hometown of Sirte.In another major development, revolutionary fighters said they wrested control of the coastal city Thursday. Without photographic proof of Gadhafi's capture, it was unclear whether Thursday would turn out to be the biggest day in recent Libyan history.Statements made by representatives of Libya's new leadership in the past have not always turned out to be true.Still, Libyans erupted in joy. Horns blared and celebratory gunfire burst into the air in Tripoli.Gadhafi ruled Libya with an iron fist for 42 years. The mercurial leader came to power in a bloodless coup against King Idris in 1969, when he was just an army captain.By the end of his rule, he claimed to be "King of Kings," a title he had a gathering of tribal leaders grant him in 2008.But a February uprising evolved into civil war that resulted in ousting the strongman from power.Many were waiting for photographs as proof of Gadhafi's capture. Earlier, anti-Gadhafi fighters said they had taken control of the last holdout of loyalists in Sirte. They said they were still battling pockets of resistance, but they were in control of District 2.Sirte has been the big prize for Libya's NTC, waiting for the city to fall to officially declare liberation.Most residents abandoned Sirte in the many weeks of bloody battles that raged there. Revolutionary forces have fought Gadhafi's men street by street, cornering the last vestiges of the old regime to that last district. Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, for alleged crimes against humanity has not been seen in public in months. Many believed he was hiding out in Sirte after rebel forces marched into Tripoli in August.Copyright 2012 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Just they tell me this is the size, and time to get it in by and so forth," Rafael said. "So we come in, and Uncle Sam gets the fish."According to NOAA, the fish will be sold on consignment overseas and proceeds will be held pending final resolution of the case.Earlier this year, a 754-pound bluefin tuna was sold at a Tokyo auction selling for nearly $396,000.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Luckily, companies are designing products that help boomers retain their active lifestyles.<COL>(NewsUSA) - Many baby boomers expect to exercise well into their seventies, and most plan to live independently for as long as possible. Luckily, companies are designing products that help boomers retain their active lifestyles.To help consumers find products that are easy to use at any age, the Arthritis Foundation developed its Ease of Use program, which employs testers with moderate-to-severe arthritis to evaluate products. The Arthritis Foundation provides the following tips for boomers unwilling to let age interfere with their favorite activities:* Choose exercise equipment that reduces strain on joints. Baby boomers love their exercise, so it can be frustrating when knees, hips and backs protest after running or cycling. But there's no reason that boomers can't make adjustments that allow them to continue their favorite activities.For example, gym rats can find indoor exercise equipment specifically designed to avoid straining hips, knees and shoulders. The NuStep 4000 Recumbent Cross Trainer received the Arthritis Foundation's Ease-of-Use Commendation for its comfortable seat and ability to provide an effective upper- and lower-body workout without stressing joints.* Make bathroom cleaning more accessible. Cleaning the bathroom can often be an arduous task. Bending and scrubbing can add unwanted pressure to joints and muscles. Products like Scrubbing Bubbles, an SC Johnson cleaning product, has incorporated innovative ways to ease unnecessary work from the necessary evil of cleaning the bathroom. Scrubbing Bubbles' Automatic Shower Cleaner is a breakthrough cleaning system that automatically sprays cleaner to eliminate the buildup of tough soap scum and mold and mildew stains. The cleaning formula combines with the water on your shower walls to begin working immediately.* Eliminate bending and kneeling. As you age, climbing on chairs to reach tall shelves or stooping to fish through low cabinets becomes less feasible. Designing your home to put your possessions in reach can help you stay independent as you age.When purchasing cabinets or other storage spaces, look for features like adjustable shelving, pullouts and extensions. For example, The Diamond Logix 36 Inch SuperCabinet with Rollouts and Pullouts has three roll-out trays, dual storage and two wire pull-out baskets, so you don't have to reach, kneel or bend to access items.No email address was supplied by.

Morning runs outside get replaced with snuggling under the covers, and healthy eating goes by the wayside as sweets become the norm.<COL>(NewsUSA) - For many of us, sticking to our health routine can be difficult. Morning runs outside get replaced with snuggling under the covers, and healthy eating goes by the wayside as sweets become the norm. Well, you can indulge and still stick to a healthy routine with just a few simple tweaks to your lifestyle. Valerie Waters, celebrity fitness trainer and contributor to publications like In Style, Fitness, Self and People, offers motivational tips just for you:1. Get your Omega-3s, even if you don't like fish. The body produces low levels of Omega-3s, and the average diet contains insufficient amounts, so supplementing is important. Omega-3s have heart, brain and eye benefits. For those who would rather not swallow a giant pill, the makers of Centrum just launched ProNutrients, a new line of supplements from the most trusted multivitamin, with an Omega-3 that comes in a concentrated MiniGel.2. Eat dinner earlier. When you eat dinner between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m., you are less likely to munch early or eat something late at night.3. Eat seasonal fruits and veggies. Pick the brightest fruits and veggies and experiment with new flavors. Fresh produce improves your skin, gives you more energy and builds up your immune system. Options include butternut squash, kale, sweet potatoes and grapefruit. Complement your choices with a multivitamin, especially one for your specific health needs. Recently launched, Centrum Specialist multivitamins with heart, vision, energy or prenatal benefits gives you confidence you've made a smart nutritional choice.4. Quench your thirst before you feel it. Dry rooms and extra heat cause you to lose more water in the winter. If your lips are chapped or you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Drink a glass of water during each meal and while you workout to help stay hydrated.5. Get off the couch, but stay close to it. If you don't want to go outside to work out, modify your routine to exercise indoors. Squats, lunges, planks and pushups can all be done in your own home. Aim for at least 15 to 20 minutes a day. Also, park farther away while shopping at the mall, and use the stairs when possible.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Sometimes, though, holiday horticulture can cause some inconveniences, or worse.<COL>iStock/LiliboasThe holidays are a time of joy and family ... and plants. If you think about it, horticulture plays a surprisingly large part of the holiday season.We use evergreen Christmas trees, holly wreaths, poinsettias and other gift plants, and my favorite, mistletoe (and kissing beneath it!). All of these plants have great historical and symbolic meaning for the Christmas holiday.Sometimes, though, holiday horticulture can cause some inconveniences. Pine needles need to be swept up; water spilled or splashed while filling the tree stand needs to be mopped up; and soil from potted plants that are knocked over by kids or pets needs to be both swept and mopped.In some extreme cases, though, our use of plants during the holiday can lead to tragedy. Tree fires are not unheard of, and people and pets have been known to become sick after eating some of the greenery.Don't allow our glad times to become sad times! A little bit of forethought can "wrap up" these holiday challenges ...Dried-out Christmas treesCut trees are the centerpiece for Christmas decorating. But because of the dry indoor environment and their general lack of a root system, they dry out quickly. A dry tree is a flammable tree! Keeping the tree hydrated is an absolute must to keep your family safe.When you get your cut tree home, saw off the bottom of the trunk to expose some fresh wood. Immediately place the tree in a bucket of water, or in a tree stand with a full reservoir. A freshly cut tree will absorb a surprisingly large amount of water over the first several days, so be sure to check and replenish the reservoir at least two or three times a day.The various chemical additives that supposedly decrease the flammability of the tree aren't necessary. Plain old water works as well as anything; in fact, some of the additives may block the tree's ability to take up water; others can cause bacterial growth in the reservoir, or pose a health risk to pets.And for goodness sake, never use lit candles or frayed light strings on a tree.The next holiday horticulture disaster can really bug you ...Christmas tree pestsCut trees sometimes have their own organic tree ornaments already attached, in the form of egg sacs, cocoons and hibernating insects. After a few days in a nice, warm living room, they tend to hatch out, adding to the excitement of the holiday. Nothing like 100 baby praying mantises swarming the ornaments to liven up the party!Before bringing the tree indoors, check it for hitchhikers.Most egg sacs and cocoons will be located inside the body of the tree, hidden by the needles. Checking the tree while it's still lying down in the driveway gives you a better view of the undersides of the lower branches. Cocoons and webbing can be wiped off and removed. If you do find a praying mantis egg sac (they are grayish brown, about the size of a walnut), carefully remove it and tie it to a shrub or tree in your yard.Do not spray the tree with an insecticide. The chemical may make the tree more flammable, and it's not healthy to breathe in the vapors.Of course, sometimes it's the plant itself which can cause trouble ...Toxic plantsA popular myth is that poinsettias are poisonous. This has been proven to be not true.That being said, I wouldn't recommend adding one to your salad. It's always possible for someone to have an allergy to the plant (just like an allergy to strawberries); some people have been known to develop a skin irritation from the milky sap.The berries of mistletoe can be toxic in large numbers. This is especially a concern with small pets and very young children, where just a couple of berries can be enough to cause problems. The seeds within the red berries of yews are toxic, and holly berries can cause upset stomach. All parts of the Christmas Rose (one of the hellebores) can be poisonous if eaten.One of the most common pet poisonings occurs from chocolate. Keep all candy where pets can't get to it.No email address was supplied by.

But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies.<COL>istock(NewsUSA) - Exercise improves health at any age. But when unprepared boomers hit tracks, trails and tennis courts, they can harm their bodies."Weekend warriors and boomers are more susceptible to injury because oftentimes they are not keeping themselves physically prepared," says Dr. Anne Meyer, whose private practice in West Los Angeles, Calif., focuses on sports rehabilitation.Physical activities can strain ligaments and muscles, and damage joints. Falls and overexertion can injure aging exercisers. But boomers don't have to exchange outdoor fun for weekends spent channel surfing.With a few steps, exercisers can stay both active and healthy. According to Meyer, exercising and stretching three times a week can help prepare boomers' bodies for active weekends.Simple stretching before and after exercise can help prevent injury. Boomers should always include warm-ups and cool-downs in their workout routines. Nutrition also helps the body recover from exercise. Limiting processed foods and consuming more fresh fruits, vegetables and high-quality proteins encourages the body to build healthy new tissues."Tissues are constantly being renewed. Sometimes what you remove from your diet is more important than what you add. Artificial sweeteners should be eliminated," Meyer advises. "To keep hydrated, exercisers need to drink water often. Eating a small amount every four hours can boost metabolism and keep bodies energized during exercise. Weekend warriors with arthritis may want to avoid citrus, which can aggravate arthritic symptoms. Fish oils are a good addition to help decrease inflammation."If an injury occurs, boomers should rest, apply ice, elevate an injured arm or leg, and consider treating pain with topical agents like Boiron's odorless Arnicare Gel. Arnicare Gel safely treats muscle aches and stiffness, and relieves swelling and bruising."I recommend Arnicare Gel to my patients to reduce pain, swelling and bruising when injuries do occur," says Meyer. She also advises people to seek medical attention if pain persists.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

While Buccaneer is facing criticism from those who say they saw warning signs the company was struggling, others say it still had some success.Bob Shavelson, executive director of the Cook Inletkeeper watershed protection group, says the news of Buccaneer's bankruptcy filing came as no surprise."We predicted it in February because we saw the whole thing was a house of cards, the way it was set up," Shavelson said.Shavelson says Buccaneer failed to keep many of its promises."They came into our community, they misled our government officials, they lied to local residents, they failed to pay local contractors, they engaged in activities that harmed our fish and game habitat without permits," Shavelson said. "They were lawless."Shavelson says it's unfortunate that the state sank a series of incentives and tax rebates into helping the company -- but Joe Balash, commissioner of the state Department of Natural Resources, says it did that because it saw potential."It's unfortunate they weren't able to keep their business intact and make a go of it, but our credit programs incentives are working," Balash said. "We're attracting capital, we're getting a lot of work done that hadn't been done before."James Hemsath, the deputy director of the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority which began working with Buccaneer four years ago, says plans are in the works to find operators and users for the jack-up rig at rest in Port Graham."Getting to a new operator and a new manager of the rig, finding the finance and funds to do the refinance and refurbishment of the rig and getting it operational for a late summer season, a short summer season would be ideal," Hemsath said.While the future isn't entirely clear yet, AIDEA says it's hopeful the concerned parties will find a way to make sure the rig doesn't stay idle for long.AIDEA says what happens to the drill rig will ultimately be decided by its owner, Ezion Holdings in Singapore."We're not giving up on Buccaneer," Hemsath said. "Buccaneer has had a good plan, they had good leases. What happens in bankruptcy will determine what we do with Buccaneer."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Hearing the symptoms, the Coast Guard duty flight surgeon recommended transport.The man was flown from Dutch Harbor to Cold Bay just after 8 a.m. Monday, and by 10 a.m. had arrived at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage.Eggert said the crewman received treatment until he died Tuesday morning around 6:40 a.m.Few details were available Tuesday about the man’s illness. Eggert said the crewmember had worked as part of the Marine Safety Detachment in Dutch Harbor since May 2013, and his work involved safety examinations on fishing vessels and attending to pollution aboard vessels.“Effectively protecting the environment and protecting mariners from the dangers of their lifestyle,” Eggert said.While the cause of the illness is still being investigated, Eggert said the Coast Guard “has no reason to believe” it was caused by anything he came into contact with “during the course of his duties.” He said the illness seems to be “isolated” and that there’s no concern it might spread to other members in the detachment.The Coast Guard will not release information on the man’s medical condition or cause of death until an autopsy is completed. It was unknown when that examination would be performed, but Eggert said the Coast Guard does not perform its own autopsies in medical deaths.The illness and the man’s death remain under investigation.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The incident is under investigation.”Since the grounding, contractors have seen a 100-foot oil sheen from the Tempest, which was estimated to be carrying about 30 gallons of diesel fuel.Coast Guard officers say several state agencies, as well as local volunteers, are helping coordinate their response to the sheen.“Marine Safety Unit Valdez, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Department of Natural Resources are working together to eliminate this pollution threat,” Lt. Jason Smilie, MSU Valdez’s chief of prevention, said in the statement. “We would also like to thank the members of the Ellamar community for their assistance in the response efforts.”An email to Eggert requesting further details about the incident wasn’t immediately answered Tuesday afternoon.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Recipe Tip<COL>Makes 4 servingsU.S. Farm-Raised Catfish is now the #1 farmed fish in the country.  Production is concentrated in four states ? Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi -- where the fish are raised under strict standards (see Tip).

Unfortunately, this time-tested advice proves more easily said than done, and heart disease remains one of the top killers of Americans.Every 25 seconds someone experiences an episode of coronary distress, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about one person will die from a coronary event every minute. These are striking statistics that should be taken to heart as part of a commitment to making small changes that will lead to big health results."People think that maintaining a healthy diet is difficult, but it's important to remember that making small dietary and lifestyle changes can reap major health rewards," says Christine M. Palumbo, registered dietitian and a nutrition advisor for California Raisins. "For example, adding California Raisins to your diet will deliver potassium and antioxidants along with fiber and inulin to help promote a healthy heart and digestive system. Plus, just 1/4 cup equals a full serving of fruit."Here are five easy tips Palumbo recommends in order to jumpstart a healthier lifestyle and boost your heart health:1. Lose 10. If you are overweight, losing just 10 percent of your body weight will reduce blood pressure, inflammation and belly fat.2. Move more. According to the latest data, Americans watch 34 hours of TV each week. Try putting a treadmill in front of the screen, jump rope, or march in place during half of your TV-watching time. Even brief bouts of activity improve cardiac risk.3. Eat fish. Studies find that eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, which reduces risk for heart disease.4. Seek power snacks. Instead of running to the vending machine for a late afternoon sugary snack, reach for an energy-boosting power snack of California Raisins and almonds. Mix 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup of nuts for on-the-go snacking all week long.5. Make room for whole grains. Whole grains run the gamut from oats and barley to brown rice and bulgur. Switch up your recipes and try making a barley risotto, a bulgur pilaf or a quinoa salad.To get started in thinking about the many tasty combinations you can mix up, here's a cholesterol-free, protein-packed recipe that will surely help boost your energy and kick start more heart healthy habits.

Next, tackle the blueberry-banana pancakes. Then thwap, thwap; blades blur and grass ripples. Hang on to your sunhat as you're whisked high into the blue sky, up to the jagged peaks of the Purcells, and plopped -- peacefully -- in the middle of absolutely nowhere. It's called heli-hiking, and once you try it, you'll never hoof it uphill for a view again. The guided walk can be as leisurely, or as challenging, as you choose. And the beauty of the surroundings brings out the playfulness in all: Silver-haired siblings frolic in a wildflower-filled meadow; kids toss snow over steep rocks. At the end of the day, everyone reunites back at the lodge for a well-deserved dinner. After a soak in the rooftop tub, you're ready for tomorrow's adventure. INFO: Bugaboo Lodge is one of six wilderness lodges run by Canadian Mountain Holidays; 800-661-0252. –Rachel LevinLoews Ventana Canyon Resort, Tucson, ArizonaWithin minutes of leaving the resort's tony confines, you can hike into some genuine, 100 percent American wilderness. The monumental resort, edged by a golf course, sits at the head of its namesake canyon in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains. After a brief stretch through a private easement, you enter the pristine Sonoran Desert habitat of the Pusch Ridge Wilderness. Saguaros crowd the slopes and huge boulders fill the canyon bottom, where a seasonal stream runs. About 2½ miles of hiking offers a nice taste of the canyon's beauty and leads to shallow swimming holes (depending on rains) at Maiden Pools. But if you're really inspired, the trail continues for another few miles and climbs more than 3,000 feet into the heart of the Catalinas. INFO: 800-234-5117. –Matthew JaffeOlinda Country Cottages, Makawao, HawaiiHigh above beach level in Maui's Upcountry, these cottages on a hill command a stunning view of the island's North Shore. About 15 minutes up the road from Makawao, the place is at 4000-foot elevation, meaning cool mornings and plenty of fresh air and making this spot a great getaway for hikers. Stay in Hidden Cottage (our favorite) and wander the property's 8.6 acres of grassy meadow and protea groves. Or walk to the nearby Waihou Spring Forest Reserve, part of the state's Na Ala Hele Trails System. Choose from two trails, with the more challenging route descending down through a eucalyptus-and-koa forest to Kailua Gulch. INFO: 800-932-3435. –Amy TraversoVentana Inn & Spa, Big Sur, CaliforniaIt's a good thing the Ventana Inn & Spa is on more than 200 acres of pristine California coast, because something has to lure you out of your room. This low-key but luxurious resort is so plush and comfy -- with luxe beds, private decks, spa tubs, fireplaces, and flat-screen TVs -- it's tempting to spend your stay in a bathrobe with room service on speed dial. But that would be a shame, because Ventana's real strength is its location. As soon as you step outside, you're rewarded with heart-stopping views of the Pacific (or an equally beautiful sea of fog), the unmistakable smell of coyote brush and coastal sage, and access to 300 miles of hiking trails through the Ventana Wilderness. The inn also has a hiking concierge service to help find just the right route. INFO: 800-628-6500. –Samantha SchoechHacienda Hotel & Casino, Boulder City, NevadaHop straight from the casino floor to a railroad route turned trail when you stay at the Hacienda, 30 miles from the Strip. This is not the Bellagio -- rooms are motel-modest -- but they're comfortable and clean, and won't empty your bank account. From the east parking lot, descend the path and veer right to see the five tunnels on the Historic Railroad Trail, which once conveyed construction materials to Hoover Dam. The 2.7-mile (one-way) route offers views of Lake Mead, where you might spot a bighorn sheep or two. You can access 30 more miles of trails from here, with options like taking the ambitious 9-mile trek (with a strenuous climb) into Bootleg Canyon, a hot spot for mountain bikers, or walking the easier Lakeshore Trail, along the edge of Lake Mead. INFO: 800-245-6380. –J.C. DavisMt. Ashland Inn, Ashland, OregonYou can drive to the Mt. Ashland Inn, or walk here from Mexico or Canada, if you're so inclined -- it's right on the Pacific Crest Trail, 5,500 feet up the mountain and 20 minutes from town. Handcrafted 20 years ago from incense cedars logged on-site, the inn has five roomy guest suites, each with a large spa tub and gas fireplace. Dine in Ashland or bring a picnic (mini fridge and microwave in each suite) to eat in your room or at the split-log picnic table outside, where long-distance backpackers often pause. The inn's generous breakfast will fuel your own hikes, to Mexico, Canada, or just along the mountain's forested slopes. INFO: 800-830-8707. –Bonnie HendersonThe Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch, Avon, ColoradoBy all means, sleep in if you like, but when you open your curtains in the morning at the opulently rustic Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch -- at the base of beautiful Beaver Creek Mountain 20 miles from Vail -- the heart-shaking panoramas will compel you to grab your walking boots and get moving. You can stroll on your own or along with Bachelor, the resident yellow Labrador retriever whose infectious energy comes in handy while hiking the Village-to-Village Trail, a wooded 6-mile trek that begins directly outside your door and connects the villages of Bachelor Gulch, Arrowhead, and Beaver Creek. Breathe in the crisp high-altitude air, watch for roaming deer, and behold the bright-hued aspen leaves that whisper in the breeze. INFO: 970-748-6200. –Lori L. MidsonWest Point Inn, Mill Valley, CaliforniaThis is the perfect spot for a back-to-nature experience -- from the comfort of a rustic Craftsman-style lodge and surrounding cabins on the south slope of Mt. Tamalpais. There's no television; cell use and propane-generated power are limited; furnishings are austere; and getting there requires a nearly 2-mile hike along fire roads. But one look at the amazing views of San Francisco, the Marin Headlands, and the East Bay from the inn's massive wraparound deck and it will all be worthwhile. Plus in the morning, Mt. Tam's trails are at your feet, from the steep descent down to Stinson Beach to the climb up East Peak. Pack in supplies for cooking up meals in the large communal kitchen; a little extra for sharing is a good idea too. INFO: No overnight guests Sun–Tue; closed to day-hikers; 415-646-0702. –Rich EhisenSnowbird Ski & Summer Resort, Snowbird, UtahWe could go on about the beauties of the Wasatch Mountains in fall -- the quaking aspen shining against mountain granite, the cerulean skies. We could go on about the pleasures of staying at Snowbird -- their jolly Oktoberfests, the great Sunday brunches, even the angular '70s architecture that still looks remarkably at home here in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Still, passionate but lazy hikers that we are, here's what we like best: Snowbird is a ski resort. That means you can ride the aerial tram to the top of 11,000-foot Hidden Peak and then hike down. Stupendous scenery and no uphill! Snowbird has four different lodging options: the dramatic (and newly renovated) Cliff Lodge and Spa; condos at the Lodge at Snowbird and Iron Blosam; and the cozy Inn at Snowbird. INFO: 800-232-9542. –Peter FishGranite Park Chalet, Glacier National Park, MontanaYou might be tempted to burst into song at the glacier-carved mountains, hanging valleys, and lush carpets of wildflowers in the "Crown of the Continent," as explorer George Bird Grinnell called this spot. The 1914 chalet is within the park, perched on a rocky outcropping at the nexus of four trails; the 7.6-mile, moderate Highline Trail is the most popular, with views of glacier peaks and the park's rocky Garden Wall along the Continental Divide. The 12-room backcountry shelter offers bunk beds and a kitchen where guests take turns cooking; you can order freeze-dried food and linens in advance. The view from the front porch is pure Bierstadt: rocky peaks, clouds, sky -- absolutely regal. INFO: Through Sept. 8; book ahead for next year starting in Oct (lodge opens in late June); 888-345-2649. –Caroline PattersonDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But pain is nothing compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.<COL>iStock / amaximSince the beginning of time, people have been willing to try just about anything to make themselves feel younger, look more attractive and be more appealing to potential mates.Women seem especially willing to forgo comfort for beauty. From plucking their eyebrows, to cramming their size 10 feet into size 6 shoes, to having fat sucked out of their body through a giant tube, women seem willing to make whatever sacrifices necessary to look their best.Beauty rituals have always been associated with some measure of physical pain. But pain seems like a welcome vice compared to the sheer repulsiveness of some of the latest beauty trends.What has the world come to when people are willing to bask in disgustingness just to clear their pores or condition their hair? Apparently (and frighteningly) it has come to this ...No. 5: Bird poop facialEver wonder how those beautiful Geisha women maintain such smooth and vibrant skin? Well, it doesn't come from your typical moisturizer or mud mask.Apparently, nightingale excrement is the secret ingredient in the Geisha facial, and celebrities all over the world have adopted the practice of putting dried bird poop on their faces in the name of beauty. In fact, at the New York City Shizuka Day Spa, you can have bird poop rubbed on your face for as little as $180!While it is true that you can get birds to poop on your car for free, the face is a much smaller target. You would have to stand outside looking up at the sky for hours -- even days -- before you got your whole face covered.But go to the spa and shell out a couple of C-notes and you can be guaranteed to have your face completely saturated with bird droppings while investing only an hour of your time. Who knew?Of course, if you think that's weird, check this out ...No. 4: Sheep placentaIt turns out that sheep placenta -- yes, the afterbirth of a sheep -- can give you clearer, younger looking skin.Whether it is rubbed on the skin as a cream or consumed orally in capsule form, experts (and celebrities like Denise Richards) swear by its beautifying effects.Allegedly, by nourishing your skin with sheep placenta, you will be able to rid yourself of unsightly blemishes and create a luminous glow from head to toe. Not only that, you'll supposedly look years younger.But then again, you are doing this by using a sheep's afterbirth, so, you know, we're just saying. If the gross-out factor doesn't bother you though, then by all means go right ahead and slap some of that sheep placenta all over your body. Who knows, maybe it will actually work.But we wouldn't make any bets about this next beauty ritual paying off ...No. 3: Fish pedicureNothing will keep you on your toes like a good old-fashioned fish pedicure. How does that work? Well, essentially, you place your tootsies into a big bucket of little fish and allow them to nibble away at your dead and dry skin cells until they have had their fill.Why is this better than the typical method of removing dry skin for a pedicure? Well according to John Ho, a salon owner in Alexandria, Va., who first brought the fishy pedicures to America from China, it is unique and more sanitary.Unique? We will definitely give you that one. Sanitary? More like sanitarium. This is just a crazy way to get a pedicure -- and there does not seem to be a whole lot of advantages to it either.Plus, what about those poor fish forced to eat people's nasty, stinky feet? You gotta feel bad for the fish.But don't feel bad for people who are whacked out enough to try this next beauty ritual ...No email address was supplied by.

The mountain lion then took a swipe, scratching the boy's arm and hand.The child yelled to his father and stood up, pulling out a hunting knife, which made the predator back down and gave the dad time to fire several shots from his 9mm handgun and scare the lion away, Idaho Department of Fish and Game Senior Conservation Officer Matt O'Connell told the AP.Conservation officers tracked down the big cat and killed it a few hours later. It was found feeding on the carcass of the family's missing hunting dog, O'Connell said.The boy was not traumatized by his encounter. Far from it."His biggest concern was that his schoolmates wouldn't believe him, which is kind of funny," O'Connell said.Internet BroadcastingNo email address was supplied by.

He was diagnosed with a “serious illness” and was eventually medevaced to Anchorage by 10 a.m.Marciniak received treatment at Alaska Regional Hospital until he died Tuesday morning around 6:40 a.m.Marciniak was 30 years old and a native of Oak Lawn, Illinois. Eggert said he joined the Coast Guard in October 2007. He had been stationed in Alaska since May 2013, working with the Marine Safety Detachment in Dutch HarborEggert said Marciniak's work involved safety examinations on fishing vessels and attending to pollution aboard vessels. The Coast Guard said Tuesday they do not believe his fatal illness was related to his work or any materials he may have come in contact with while on duty.The Coast Guard will not release information on the man’s medical condition, symptoms, or cause of death until an autopsy is completed.Marciniak's illness and death remain under investigation.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Wilson later found out his six-week-old son, Wyatt, needed to be airlifted as well.Wyatt was suffering from respiratory distress and at one point during the night stopped breathing. Wilson and his son waited until morning before making it out.When Jewell turned down the land swap to build the road, she said she wanted to protect migratory waterfowl in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.Sen. Lisa Murkowski is one of the strongest advocates for building a road. She said Wednesday that Wilson and his son’s experience only strengthen the argument for connecting the two communities.“When we have a better alternative that’s being denied to the good people of King Cove because the Secretary of the Interior is concerned about birds, that’s just wrong,” Murkowski said.Murkowski says the road would cost the federal government nothing, but its absence could cost lives.“We could have lost that baby, we could have -- these are people’s lives,” Murkowski said.“People are always getting hurt,” Wilson said. “Our lives are more important than the birds.”Wilson and his son aren’t the only ones that were medevaced recently, with a third person airlifted out of King Cove Monday -- but again, weather prevented a quick rescue. That makes five times the Coast Guard has had to fly patients out of King Cove this year.On Wednesday, Channel 2 reached out to Secretary Jewell. Her office responded saying the department has attempted several times to schedule a meeting with Murkowski.Meanwhile, Murkowski said she plans on meeting with Jewell next week.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

After all, this is the same Cameron who three years later would go on to write and direct the sci-fi classic "The Terminator" -- and eventually make the two highest grossing films of all time with "Titanic" and "Avatar."The funny thing is, Corman was operating a bigger incubator for success on "Battle Beyond the Stars" than he ever could have imagined. That's because Corman's assistant was Gale Anne Hurd, who was sent on a fateful trip from the producer's office in Brentwood, Calif., to the studio in Venice to see why the special effects on the film had fallen behind."When Gale came back from the studio, she said, 'The guy you hired to head the special effects department is good, but he, as many people do, slightly overstated his experience. The No. 2 man -- Jim Cameron -- is actually much better than the No. 1 man,'" Corman recalled in a recent interview. "So, I did something I very seldom do and went to the studio myself talked to Jim and said, 'I'm giving you a raise in the middle of picture and I want you to run the special effects (and art direction) for the rest of it.' Plus, that started the relationship between Gale and Jim, who then got married and produced the 'Terminator' pictures together."Of course, before Cameron and Hurd released "The Terminator" to the general public, they gave Corman a peek first."I remember they showed me a cut of the film and asked my thoughts," Corman recalled. "It was an expensive film but it looked bigger than it really was, so I asked them how they did it. Jim and Gale said, 'We did just what we did for you, but we had a bigger budget and we could do more.'"Engaging The 'Battle'"Battle Beyond the Stars" tells the story of Shad (Richard Thomas), a young space warrior who scours the galaxy to recruit mercenaries to help defend his peaceful planet from the evil tyrant Sador (John Saxon).Made for $2 million, "Battle Beyond the Stars" was without question Corman's most expensive film to date when filming began in 1980. A master at low-budget filmmaking, Corman admits he took a bigger risk than usual by making the film, first by expanding his usual shooting schedule from 15 to 20 days, and employing veteran actors like George Peppard and Robert Vaughn, whose fees were higher than what he was used to paying his actors.Fortunately for Corman, he had loads of more undiscovered gems in his stable of talent, including composer James Horner (another future collaborator of Cameron's) and John Sayles -- the screenwriter who would go on to write and direct such acclaimed films as "Lone Star" and "Passion Fish," which both earned Sayles Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations.The involvement of Cameron notwithstanding, Corman believes the biggest reason "Battle Beyond the Stars" is still being celebrated 30 years after its release boils down to the work of his screenwriter."I think it all starts with John Sayles' excellent script," Corman said. "We were thinking of doing something in terms of Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai' and of course, 'Star Wars.' We were looking at different elements of those. I'd been making science fiction films for many, many years, including one called 'Battle Beyond the Sun.' I figured we'd just change the title to 'Battle Beyond the Stars' to see what we could do."Apart from its notable stars like Peppard, Vaughn and Sybil Danning (who played the sexy mercenary Valkyrie Saint-Exmin), "Battle Beyond the Stars" also featured the burgeoning talents of Richard Thomas, previously known for his work on the classic television drama "The Waltons."Corman believes "Battle Beyond the Stars" was a breakout project for Thomas because it showed a completely different side of the actor."He was very instrumental to the success of it by bringing a little bit of humor into it," Corman said. "One of the keys to the success of the film was that it looked bigger than it was in comparison to other low-budget films. But there was a little bit of humor running through it just to take the edge off. Richard was very good at that."Use And RecycleWithout question, one of the reasons Corman, 85, has had such amazing longevity in Hollywood is due to his thrifty use of film budgets. If don't believe that's true, name any other filmmaker who has lived to produce nearly 400 films.Case in point: for "Battle Beyond the Stars," Corman curtailed the budgets on some of his future sci-fi films by reusing the spaceships from "Battle" in as many as four more projects.But while the practice of using and recycling is justified for low-budget filmmakers like Corman, should directors like Michael Bay be called out for allegedly using a digitally-altered shot from "The Island" for his new blockbuster "Transformers: Dark of the Moon"?While Corman doesn't think Bay re-used the shot to save money, it wouldn't surprise him if it happened because the filmmaker was on a deadline: a dilemma he said that faces all filmmakers face no matter how big of a budget they have to work with."Reusing effects and spaceships was a necessity for us because our later pictures had much lower budgets -- maybe $800,000-$900,000 -- and I had to use what I had to make it work," Corman said. "With Michael Bay it's a differently thing because he's got all the money in the world. I would guess that he was up against a time schedule. I'm making all of this up, but I'm guessing he had to deliver the picture, he looked it over one last time and said, 'That shot isn't right and I don't have time to make a new one, so what can I do?' So he grabbed an old shot and put it in."If Bay did indeed reuse the shot, Corman said he doesn't blame the director in the least for recycling a previous shot."Particularly with these big pictures, because they cost so much money to market, they have their release date set a year in advance -- sometimes more than that," Corman said. "They know that the picture has to be ready at a certain time and special effects are so unpredictable in the schedule and the money you'll spend on them."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

But take a look at what's on your plate at meals.<COL>iStock / adlifemarketingFromPureMatters.comMeat, fish, and eggs are packed with protein -- so they're great foryour muscles. But here are four not-so-obvious foods that can also help you tone your body.AlmondsCrunch for crunch,almondsare one of the best sources of alpha-tocopherolvitamin E-- the form that's best absorbed by your body. That matters to your muscles because vitamin E is a potentantioxidantthat can help prevent free-radical damage afterheavy workouts. And the fewer hits taken from free radicals, the faster your muscles will recover and start growing. How much to munch? Two handfuls a day. A Toronto University study found that people can eat that amount daily without gaining weight.Olive OilThe monounsaturated fat inolive oilappears to act as an anticatabolic nutrient. In other words, it prevents muscle breakdown by lowering levels of tumor necrosis factor, a cellular protein linked with muscle wasting. Monounsaturated fats have also been associated with lower rates ofheart disease.WaterWhether they're in your shins or your shoulders, muscles are approximately 80 percentwater. A reduction in body water of as little as 1 percent can impair exercise performance and adversely affect recovery. For example, a German study found that protein synthesis occurs at a higher rate in muscle cells that are well-hydrated, compared with dehydrated cells. Translation: The more parched you are, the slower your body uses protein to build muscle.SpinachWell,spinachand just about any other vegetable or fruit. Australian researchers found that people who reduced their antioxidant intake -- eating just one serving of fruit and two of vegetables daily -- for two weeks felt as if they were exerting more effort than when exercising on a diet rich in antioxidants. It seems that eating several servings of fruits and veggies daily can make exercise seem easier -- and help you finish those last reps.For more healthy living news and features, visit PureMatters.com -- and don't forget to stop by the Pure Matters Shop for all your vitamin and supplement needs.Source: Pure Matters http://www.purematters.com/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/surprising-fitness-foodsDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

More than two-thirds of the ill were under age 10,  and 30 percent of those infected were hospitalized, according to the CDC.  Health officials say these frogs are not safe pets for children under 5 years old."People need to be aware that these water frogs as well as other amphibians and reptiles can carry salmonella that can make people sick," says Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh, an epidemiologist at the CDC. "In this particular outbreak there is a unique strain that has been linked with African frogs associated with a single facility," she adds.Blue Lobster Farms, a frog breeding facility in Madera County, Calif., has been linked to the outbreak, according to the CDC.  The company is breeds the majority of African dwarf frogs sold in the United States. The facility voluntarily stopped shipping the frogs in April after 222 people in 41 states were reportedly infected with salmonella, according to the CDC. In June the company resumed shipments. Since then several more people have been sickened."Health care officials at the Madera County Department of Environmental Health are working with the owner of Blue Lobster Farms to conduct interventions as well as ongoing investigations," says Behravesh. But she adds, "We aren't sure if they are effective. We do know reports with this specific outbreak strain are ongoing."These  frogs are usually found in home aquariums or fish tanks and are commonly sold throughout the United States in pet stores, toy stores, novelty stores, the Internet, fairs and carnivals, but Behravesh says "any frog or other amphibian is a potential risk for Salmonella."Most of the victims have been children under 5 years old, some of whom  were hospitalized according to the CDC.  Salmonella can cause life-threatening illnesses and hospitalizations, particularly in children, elderly and immune-suppressed people such as cancer patients.  Behravesh says "with school starting soon it's important for teachers to be aware and consider the age of children in their classroom to decide if an animal is appropriate," before putting children at risk.The CDC recommends thorough hand washing after contact with frogs.  But it goes further than that because water from the aquarium can be contaminated, so it's recommended to clean their tanks outside of the home to avoid contaminating surfaces inside the house.  Parents need to remember that other amphibians and reptiles such as turtles can also spread salmonella.No email address was supplied by.

Fire/KTLAA person disappeared after being swept into the surf during a baptism in Santa Barbara County, Calif., Sunday morning, according to authorities.Just before 10 a.m. on Sunday, three people were pulled into the ocean off Guadalupe Dunes Park near the conclusion of the baptismal ceremony, Capt. David Sadecki of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department stated in a news release.Two of the people were able to get out of the water on their own and were uninjured, but a third person did not return and a search effort began, according to Sadecki.Family members identified the missing person as a 43-year-old man from Santa Maria, Calif., according to TV station KCOY.Water rescue teams and two helicopter searches were unable to locate the person, Sadecki stated.On Monday, authorities investigated numerous reports that a body was seen in the water about 2 to 4 miles north of Guadalupe Dunes Park.However, the object floating near the surf line was found to be fishing buoys that were mistaken for a body, Sadecki stated.The fire department suspended their search for the person Monday morning, but U.S. Coast Guard personnel continued to search with a boat and a helicopter.A California State Parks water rescue team was also at the scene with personal water crafts, according to Sadecki.No email address was supplied by.

Another person took a calf home and had it in their living room before Fish and Game came to pick it up.“When I responded, they had the calf inside the living room,” said area wildlife biologist Todd Rinaldi. “And they had not tried to feed it, but it had urinated in their living room -- on the white carpet.”Rinaldi says none of the calves were reunited with their mothers, and they had to be taken to the Alaska Zoo or the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center.Fish and Game says cow moose will often leave their calves alone, sometimes up to 24 hours, before reuniting with them. Officials say human contact can cause a cow to truly abandon its calf, if the animal smells like a person or something out of the ordinary.If you find a lone calf during business hours, you can call the Alaska Department of Fish and Game at 907-746-6300. If it's after hours, call Alaska State Troopers and they will get in touch with Fish and Game.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Signs have been placed by scientists warning the public of the bear’s presence and the danger it poses.“If they see those signs up, definitely pay attention and turn around,” said Fish and Game spokesperson Ken Marsh. “Those bears are very defensive of their kills.”Scientists have been monitoring the situation, often trying to lure and scare the bear away from the carcass. So far their attempts have only resulted in the bear dragging the carcass further into the brush, Marsh said. Marsh says the kill occurred Tuesday evening, according to interviews scientists conducted with area residents."The last time (scientists) saw the carcass it was down to bare bones," Marsh said. "Scientists expect the bear will likely leave whatever is left within the next 10 to 12 hours."The situation will continue to be monitored, Marsh said, as long as the bear continues to stay in the area or until scientists are able to remove the carcass.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That's great, but you need more than calcium to stay strong. Here's your full lineup for better bones.<COL>FromPureMatters.comYou might already know that yourbonesgain most of their mass byage18 and that their density begins a steep decline withmenopause. But there are many ways to maintain -- and even grow -- bone density during those decades in between. Besides the obvious (get enoughcalcium!), here's a rundown of the other vitamins, minerals, and even proteins that can help ensure a strong skeleton.Vitamin D.If you don't get enoughvitamin D, then half the calcium you work so hard to get in your system just ends up flushed out. Vitamin D -- which you can get from food (fish and fortified dairy), sunlight, orsupplements-- helps your body absorb calcium from food. It's also linked to other health benefits that includecancer prevention. Protein creates the scaffolding upon which healthy bones are built. Low-fat dairy products such as milk andyogurtare great multitasking sources -- you get calcium, protein, and often vitamin D all in one place. Other protein sources: lean meats,fish, eggs, poultry, tofu, beans, and nuts.Magnesium.This mineral combines with calcium to form bone mass on top of protein's foundation. Unfortunately, most American women's diets don't contain enough of the foods in whichmagnesiumis abundant -- avocados,wheatgerm, whole grains,soy, and leafy greens. That's why a supplement can be beneficial.Potassium.This electrolyte keeps your body's acid levels in just the right range for optimum bone health. Since your body uses it quickly, it's a good idea to eat potassium-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, throughout the day.Vitamin K.Vitamin Khas many jobs within the body, the most obvious being helping blood clot when you get a cut. But it also plays an important role in bone health by leading calcium into the bones and preventing it from leaching back out. For all the importance of vitamin K, your body actually only needs small amounts. To get what you need, eat a diet rich in leafy greens; a multivitamin can also help.Remember: A strong skeleton is essential for everything from carrying in groceries to biking through wine country to romping with your grandkids (today or someday).For more healthy living news and features, visit PureMatters.com -- and don't forget to stop by the Pure Matters Shop for all your vitamin and supplement needs.Source: Pure Matters http://www.purematters.com/healthy-body/bone-health/go-beyond-calcium-for-healthy-bonesDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

"Those are really tiny little cubs, they're so cute."The sow and her two cubs were spotted Wednesday across the street from Providence Alaska Medical Center.Carrie Saurerbry, a lifeguard at Goose Lake, says the bears even walked near the lake's beach."They actually came out onto the beach right over there, so we got on a loudspeaker and started yelling, telling everyone to get off the beach," Saurerbry said. "The mom started walking away and one of the cubs ran up a tree."University Police Department Chief Rick Shell says it received more reports of sightings of the family again on Thursday near the Fine Arts Building on campus."She hasn't shown any aggression, she tries to move away from the people whenever they start to crowd her," Shell said.Shell says the university wants people to use caution so that she doesn't become aggressive."Anybody who's ever had children knows if you think your children are being threatened, you're going to become aggressive," Shell said.Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Dave Battle says there are some myths about chasing a sow away from her cubs that aren't true."I've seen a number of people that think they can still scare the mom away with the bears up the tree," Battle said.Battle says that's simply not the case."This is a bear with two small cubs; those cubs were just born this winter and if they're up a tree, she's not going anywhere," Battle said.While the bears may be cute and fun to watch, authorities ask people to share the habitat and watch from a safe distance.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The reality: At Petit St. Vincent, it's the same as the fantasy. Twenty-two understatedly elegant stone cottages, overlooking the water and open to the breezes, scatter across this 113-acre island. With rates starting at $675 a night, Petit St. Vincent qualifies as a splurge, but the price covers all activities and meals. Open November through August; 800-654-9326 orpsvresort.com.The Inn on Peaks Island, MaineRocky, rustic, small-town New England floats languidly in Casco Bay, two miles from downtown Portland. Summer brings visitors seeking art galleries, nature, and relaxation. In winter, you can snuggle up at the inn and enjoy the muted clang of buoys in the bay and the sharp scent of a wood fire. Six pleasantly furnished suites feature fireplaces, private decks, and spa tubs. The Pub restaurant serves seafood and locally brewed beers year-round. A 20-minute ferry ride connects Peaks with the shopping, dining, and nightlife of Portland.

"Old Polynesia" decor and a low-key atmosphere mark it as a throwback to an era when Hawaii meant tropical exoticism, not real-estate opportunities. A short drive west takes you to the town of Paia.

Today, anyone can share its still-genteel lifestyle at the posh Collier Inn. Seven antiques-filled suites recall the pre-Depression boom years when ad exec and developer Barron Collier held sway over most of Southwest Florida, and gentlemen in white suits competed civilly at croquet.

And, true to island character, it feels like a place apart. The red-roof turrets and dormers of the 1888-vintage, beachfront Hotel del Coronado confirm it. Across the street, so does the Glorietta Bay Inn, which incorporates a 1908 Italian Renaissance mansion. Rooms in The Del's rambling original building have more character, but the newer structures (especially the Beach Village cottages and villas) tend to offer nicer accommodations; 800-468-3533 orhoteldel.com. Rooms in the main resort range from $255 to $1,650; Beach Village accommodations range from $450 to $5,400. At the Glorietta, choose the mansion.

Accommodations tend to be comfortable but rustic?except at English Country Garden Bed & Breakfast (at Indian Brook), which opts for comfortable and luxurious.

The laid-back Caribbean island of Cozumel attracts scuba divers and snorkelers, beach bums, and honeymooners who prefer quiet togetherness. Tucked away next to the airport, of all places (but away from the flight paths, so jet noise does not intrude), Casita de Maya provides the perfect headquarters for a getaway. The four rooms, beautifully appointed in earthy colors, open onto a pretty little courtyard with a pool. Owner Dan Komorowsky and his staff can answer any question about the island and arrange expeditions. They also know when to disappear and give guests time for themselves. Rates from $71; 281-214-1122 orcasitademaya.com.MacKaye Harbor Inn, Lopez Island, WashingtonLike most out-of-the-way places, Lopez (north of Seattle in the San Juan Islands) attracts residents who want to do something different. As you meander the mostly flat roads, you'll encounter organic farmers and winemakers, cattle ranchers, artists, and such establishments as the Love Dog Café and Vortex Juice Bar & Good Food. MacKaye Harbor Inn, in a huge restored farmhouse near the south end of the island, lends guests mountain bikes to explore. Of course, you'll want to be back at the inn in time for evening chocolates and spectacular sunsets.

Guest perks include onsite spa services and sailing trips on Lake Erie. Alas, the inn operates only April through October. But that does cover the summer tourist season, as well as the spring and fall, allowing a chance to catch sight of migrating raptors, waterfowl, and songbirds.

In the late 1800s, America's business elite began gathering at Jekyll Island each year for winter vacation. Some stayed in the extravagant clubhouse; others built grand holiday homes nearby. The Jekyll Island Club Hotel now occupies the clubhouse and several other historic buildings, including a couple of the cottages, keeping up the standards splendidly. You can wander the 240-acre Millionaire's Village and envision yourself in the Gilded Age. And you can play golf and tennis, cruise around the island by bicycle, inhale the fresh salt air on the beach, and ride in a horse-drawn carriage.

Far down to the right, the sapphire ocean shimmers. As the trail winds to the left, a cool canopy of deep-green foliage dotted with pink and orange blossoms awaits. In the distance, the coastline juts in and out, its steep cliffs dropping to the sea.Ask visitors why they've come to Kauai's North Shore and they all give a variation of the same answer: to revel in that scenery. To surf in the sparkling ocean, hike in the rain forest, scuba dive among the dramatic underwater formations, kayak the rivers, or just gape at the rainbows that seem to form upon command over Hanalei Bay.Chelsea Pavone came for a week in 2006, and promptly went back to California to quit her job. "I gave 30 days' notice and had a huge garage sale," she says. "I decided that I'd just go and play for a while."For Chelsea, who spends her workdays leading hikes and kayaking trips and her free time surfing, "a while" is open-ended. For the rest of us, it may be just a few days?but what a recess. James Thresher, an insurance analyst from Phoenix, explored the late-spring North Shore with his wife via helicopter, boat, and fins. "We could snorkel above and along the lava cliffs," he says of the complex formations at Tunnels Reef. "It's probably the best snorkeling that I've ever seen."Immersing yourself in the scenery doesn't mean you have to sleep in a tent, though. Even at the marbled and massive Princeville Hotel, muddy, bedraggled guests are greeted charitably upon their return from the wild. Waterside rooms deliver unparalleled views of Hanalei Bay and the mountains you climbed that morning. A private beach and pool deliver post-kayak relaxation complete with fruity drinks and fresh pineapple. You can even opt for a seaside massage before dining at one of the hotel's three restaurants. Whatever else you do here, though, don't miss sunset on the patio. Visitors come from other resorts to witness the spectacle.Staying at the centrally located Princeville Hotel allows easy access to the North Shore's 15 miles of coastline, from the lighthouse at Kilauea Point to the crashing surf of Hanakapiai Beach. For an intimate introduction, put on your oldest pair of walking shoes (they'll soon be permanently mud-stained) and drive past lush taro fields, over a series of one-lane bridges, and through Hanalei town to the highway's end. The Kalalau Trail begins here, and its first two miles to Kalalau Beach provide plenty of heart-stopping views. You'll be tempted, but don't cool off after the hike with a swim. A sign warning of fierce currents makes its case with tick marks tracking drownings. It's far safer to sit on the rocks, enjoy a picnic lunch, and watch the surf toss around the fools who ignore the sign.James and Paula Thresher skipped the hike and spent most of their time in more placid waters, spotting everything from sea turtles to white-tipped reef sharks. James says their best day was on Tunnels Beach, barbecuing fish tacos and snorkeling the reef. "There is just a ton of marine life there," he says. "Really fabulous stuff."While it's easy to pick up a deli picnic, don't miss at least one lunch at Tropical Taco in Hanalei. This quirky establishment with limited indoor seating and only lemonade to drink offers customers a warning on its surfboard menu: "Not to be consumed one hour before surfing!" Take your beer-battered-fish burrito and lemonade out to the lanai, and climb onto a bar stool at the railing. There, you can admire wandering roosters, passing cyclists, and the yard art across the street.For dinner, Postcards Café prepares fresh seafood and gourmet vegetarian meals using primarily organic ingredients, including herbs and tropical fruit from its own garden. The result: divine island-centric offerings such as taro fritters with pineapple-ginger chutney, wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, and a mousse made from lilikoi, a type of passion fruit. While reservations are advised, the café (a replica of the 19th-century rice-plantation cottage that once stood here) is casual and welcoming.The same can be said of Kauai's North Shore. Visitors seeking a peaceful getaway gravitate to the laid-back pace and utter lack of nightlife. Like guide Chelsea Pavone, mortgage broker and jewelry maker Aia Walker moved to Kauai permanently after a visit. (Steel yourself: The island has transformed the most resolute tourists into lifelong residents.) "I discovered how to live life slowly and savor things," Aia says. "Like sunsets. And bananas."And indelible red mud.No email address was supplied by.

"I decided that I'd just go and play for a while."For Chelsea, who spends her workdays leading hikes and kayaking trips and her free time surfing, "a while" is open-ended. For the rest of us, it may be just a few days?but what a recess. James Thresher, an insurance analyst from Phoenix, explored the late-spring North Shore with his wife via helicopter, boat, and fins. "We could snorkel above and along the lava cliffs," he says of the complex formations at Tunnels Reef. "It's probably the best snorkeling that I've ever seen."Immersing yourself in the scenery doesn't mean you have to sleep in a tent, though. Even at the marbled and massive Princeville Hotel, muddy, bedraggled guests are greeted charitably upon their return from the wild. Waterside rooms deliver unparalleled views of Hanalei Bay and the mountains you climbed that morning. A private beach and pool deliver post-kayak relaxation complete with fruity drinks and fresh pineapple. You can even opt for a seaside massage before dining at one of the hotel's three restaurants. Whatever else you do here, though, don't miss sunset on the patio. Visitors come from other resorts to witness the spectacle.Staying at the centrally located Princeville Hotel allows easy access to the North Shore's 15 miles of coastline, from the lighthouse at Kilauea Point to the crashing surf of Hanakapiai Beach. For an intimate introduction, put on your oldest pair of walking shoes (they'll soon be permanently mud-stained) and drive past lush taro fields, over a series of one-lane bridges, and through Hanalei town to the highway's end. The Kalalau Trail begins here, and its first two miles to Kalalau Beach provide plenty of heart-stopping views. You'll be tempted, but don't cool off after the hike with a swim. A sign warning of fierce currents makes its case with tick marks tracking drownings. It's far safer to sit on the rocks, enjoy a picnic lunch, and watch the surf toss around the fools who ignore the sign.James and Paula Thresher skipped the hike and spent most of their time in more placid waters, spotting everything from sea turtles to white-tipped reef sharks. James says their best day was on Tunnels Beach, barbecuing fish tacos and snorkeling the reef. "There is just a ton of marine life there," he says. "Really fabulous stuff."While it's easy to pick up a deli picnic, don't miss at least one lunch at Tropical Taco in Hanalei. This quirky establishment with limited indoor seating and only lemonade to drink offers customers a warning on its surfboard menu: "Not to be consumed one hour before surfing!" Take your beer-battered-fish burrito and lemonade out to the lanai, and climb onto a bar stool at the railing. There, you can admire wandering roosters, passing cyclists, and the yard art across the street.For dinner, Postcards Café prepares fresh seafood and gourmet vegetarian meals using primarily organic ingredients, including herbs and tropical fruit from its own garden. The result: divine island-centric offerings such as taro fritters with pineapple-ginger chutney, wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, and a mousse made from lilikoi, a type of passion fruit. While reservations are advised, the café (a replica of the 19th-century rice-plantation cottage that once stood here) is casual and welcoming.The same can be said of Kauai's North Shore. Visitors seeking a peaceful getaway gravitate to the laid-back pace and utter lack of nightlife. Like guide Chelsea Pavone, mortgage broker and jewelry maker Aia Walker moved to Kauai permanently after a visit. (Steel yourself: The island has transformed the most resolute tourists into lifelong residents.) "I discovered how to live life slowly and savor things," Aia says. "Like sunsets. And bananas."And indelible red mud.No email address was supplied by.

He says cans are lighter and more portable than bottles - especially when taking part in outdoor activities like backpacking, boating, fishing and just being on the beach.The canned beer is only currently available in Alaska. The Juneau production plant doesn't have enough room right now to produce enough canned beer for the Lower 48 markets.However, the brewery recently broke ground on a multimillion dollar expansion. The canned beer will be more widely distributed once the larger facility has been completed.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The town is another of my known favorites (there are probably plenty of favorite places in Alaska I just haven’t visited yet).The town reminds me a lot of a little fishing community I used to go to growing up in California called Dillon Beach, specifically Lawson’s Landing. If you’re ever in Petaluma, California, I highly recommend taking the 40-minute trip west to visit it.Anyway, Marti had managed to book us a sea taxi aboardAshore Water Taxi & Freightwith Dave Lyon and his dog Pika.A Palo Alto, California native, Dave reminded me a lot of one of my uncles, another man who had spent plenty of time on a boat in the ocean. Dave’s first-mate and one of the most talkative dogs I’ve ever met, Pika had good enough sea legs to balance herself on the boat’s side railing without ever falling overboard.Dave knew a thing or two about Kachemak Bay and plenty of being out on the open sea. We talked about the oyster farming industry and he knew a lot about Dillon Beach and its local oyster farms from growing in nearby Palo Alto. It was good talking with someone who knew a good deal about my old stomping grounds.It had been awhile since I’d been on a boat, and I’m not talking about acruise ship. Dave’s water taxi was a 20-foot skiff with an open deck and an enclosed cabin big enough to seat about a dozen people. Being onboard reminded me a lot of the sea adventures me and my father and brothers used to take when we were younger. The wind blowing in our face on a calm, clear day in Homer, not even the weakest of stomachs could have got sea sick that day.The 10-minute ride across Kachemak Bay to Halibut Cove was not long enough for me, and I wanted to stay out longer. But we arrived at our destination nonetheless where we metGreg and Weatherly Bates, a husband and wife mussel farming team.The Bates had crafted an innovative way of growing mussels in mass through an environmentally minded system called “mussel socking.” Essentially long lines (socks) are tethered to a plank above water and then caked with tiny baby mussel seeds. The lines are then lowered about 30 feet underwater where the baby mussels will latch onto the sock and naturally eat whatever tiny algae happening to float by. This goes on for about 15 to 20 months before Greg and Weatherly harvest them.The couple tether about 40 or 50 of these socks to a large raft-like contraption that is anchored above water. They have three such rafts buoyed inside Halibut Cove. They hope each sock produces about 50 to 70 pounds of market size mussels.When we arrived Weatherly told us they had just socked new mussel seeds that had spawned last summer. When the seeds are very small, it takes them longer to grow, and then when they hit a certain growth point, they start growing much faster underneath Kachemak’s cold, nutrient-rich waters.The Bateses studied marine biology in Rhode Island where they met before moving out to Alaska like so many, to find adventure and opportunity. It looks like they found both.Greg told me a similar model popular in Scotland inspired their farming method.  Seeing the demand in Alaska growing and no local supplier to satisfy it, Greg and Weatherly jump on the opportunity.It seemed like Greg and Weatherly really loved what they were doing and truly believed in their business. And the proof it was working seemed pretty self-evident to me, but then again, everything I know about mussel farming I just wrote about.I was in no hurry to leave Kachemak Bay, but we couldn’t stay long, so I did my best to savor the cold salty air as we rode back with Dave and Pika, taking pictures and basking in the sun. Indeed, I didn’t really want to leave Homer so soon, either, but we had to be back on the road early to be in Soldotna the next day, then onto Kenai and so on.So it goes.I managed to get out for a while after Halibut Cove. I watched the sunset into the ocean as eagles chased the other birds around while boats and yachts came and went from Kachemak. It’s really tough to leave Homer and I never look forward to it each time I visit, but I knew I’d return again. Of course I would.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The bill...<COL>Before the end of the legislative session, wildlife troopers in the Kenai
area received a windfall they were not expecting.

In capital projects bill, there was an extra $175 thousand dollar allocated
for law enforcement of the fisheries in the Kenai area.

The bill has been amended since it was proposed. One commercial setnetter
said he's glad the final draft includes enforcement for more than just set
netters.

Robert Williams, of Cook Inlet Quality Seafoods said in a phone interview
that as someone who is very involved in the fishing industry, he was
surprised he hadn't heard a word of the increased funding.

"we have lobbyists up there that watch these kinds of things. Nobody has
seen hide nor hair of it," he said.

Since the money was initially proposed, amendments were made to include
fisheries like the Kenai River dipnetting under areas that will see
increased enforcement.

Alaska's dipnetting fisheries see thousands of visitors each summer. The
city of Kenai sees more than anywhere else. City Manager Rick Koch says
more enforcement money could help protect the fishery.

Koch said, "we didn't ask for it. I'm pleased to see it. There are
certainly areas that require additional attention."

Wildlife Trooper Lt. Paul McConnell agrees.

"I don't think the money was ever put there to single out one user group,"
McConnell said. "I think it was put there because someone has realized that
the fishery peaked and the amount of people we have down during that short
period of time and the amount of enforcement maybe could use a boost."

The bill allocating the money won't be finalized until gets the governor's
final approval.No email address was supplied by.

Some risk factors are uncontrollable. Age is a major factor in blood clot development and individuals over 65 face a significantly higher risk than the rest of the population. However, other risk factors like weight and activity level can be managed with natural ways to prevent blood clots. The best natural ways to prevent blood clots include exercise, healthy eating, and regularly using fish oil supplements.Eat a balanced diet:According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, one of the biggest risk factors for blood clots is obesity. Ergo, the most effective natural way to prevent blood clots is to keep a healthy weight. Half of that battle is won in the kitchen with a healthy diet that promotes cardiovascular health. The American Heart Association recommends a diet between 1,600 and 2,000 calories that includes three to five servings of vegetables, four to five servings of fruits, and less than six ounces of meat per day.Moderate salt intake:High blood pressure can similarly contribute to blood clots and salt is the biggest dietary culprit. Eat salt in moderation and avoid foods with very high sodium counts to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and prevent the complications that come with it.Get regular exercise and physical activity:In addition to diet, the other half of the blood-clot battle is won with exercise. Exercise is not only important to maintaining a healthy weight, but also to promote circulation. Sitting still for extended periods of time leads to blood stagnation and potentially clots. This becomes an issue of particular concern for people who frequently take long flights or drives. Try to change sitting positions or stand and walk every hour as a simple natural way to prevent blood clots at work, while watching television, or during extended travel.Take fish oil supplements:Fish oil capsules are a great natural way to prevent blood clots. Fish oil is a fantastic source of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Fish oil has natural blood-thinning properties which help inhibit clot formation.Wear clothes that fit:According to the World Health Organization, tight clothing can contribute to blood stagnation and the development of blood clots. As such, one effortless natural way to prevent blood clots is to simply wear appropriately-sized clothing.Stop smoking:Smoking contributes to hardening arteries which significantly increases the risk of blood clots. For tobacco users with poor circulatory health, the ideal natural way to prevent blood clots is to stop smoking.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Cook the pasta according to package directions.  Drain well.  Rinse with cool water; drain again.When the corn has cooled, cut the kernels off the cob.  (It's best to cut or break the ear in half. On a cutting board, hold the cob upright.  Using a sharp knife, slide the blade downwards, letting the kernels fall on the board, rotating the cob a quarter turn at a time until all the kernels are removed.)In a medium bowl, toss together the pasta, corn, and tomatoes.  Add ¼ cup of the vinaigrette and toss again.Refrigerate the salad and the remaining vinaigrette in separate covered containers for at least 2 hours or for up to 2 days.  Serve the salad chilled or at room temperature.Toss the remaining vinaigrette just before serving.  Taste and add salt and pepper as desired.Spoon the salad onto lettuce-lined salad plates and garnish with basil sprigs.Paulette Mitchell, a culinary instructor, television personality, spokesperson, freelance food writer, and the award-winning author of 13 cookbooks, is known internationally for her quick-to-prepare recipes with gourmet flair.

The analysis is based on the latest data available.The five states with the highest per-capita gun death rates in 2011 were Louisiana, Mississippi, Alaska, Wyoming and Montana.“Each of these states has extremely lax gun violence prevention laws as well as a higher rate of gun ownership,” wrote the study’s publishers.The state with the lowest gun death rate in the nation was Rhode Island, followed by Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.Josh Sugarmann, VPC executive director believes Alaska’s gun regulations have “little beyond what is the minimum requirements.”“It’s looking more at what the state doesn’t have,” he said.According to Sugarmann improving regulations for private party gun transfers, the purchase of certain types of assault rifles and high-capacity magazines could help diminish the number of gun-related deaths in Alaska. Sugarmann used states like Rhode Island and Pennsylvania as good models from which Alaska could base better regulations upon.“But most importantly Alaska doesn’t have an ability to regulate gun control on a very local level, Sugarmann said.Of Alaska’s gun-related deaths, nearly 80 percent were the result of suicide, according to the study. Suicide, Sugarmann believes, could be as preventable as any of the other gun-related deaths by removing the immediate access.“These studies show there is a spontaneous triggering event,” Sugarmann said. “If you take a gun, it is the perfect weapon for taking one’s life. With a knife there is a far greater level of engagement.”Gina Maria Smith, a program coordinator with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Hunter Information and Training believes it isn’t just any gun or weapon that can be blamed for Alaska’s high rate of mortality.“I would have to use that study for Alaska and break it down by what types of firearms are being included in the study,” Smith said. “I think that would give a better indication of what is being used.”Students who enroll in hunting safety courses spend a total of 16 hours training, Smith said. Students spend about four hours in a classroom working from a workbook and spending time familiarizing themselves with the mechanics of guns and gun safety before ever touching an actual gun. After 12 hours of academic studies, students spend the remainder in practical training field tests.“They follow the regulations of the international hunter education, which line up with other states,” Smith said. “A number of students that might have firearms in the home, they actually take the class because they want to learn the firearm safety course not necessarily hunting.”The VPC calculated state gun death rates by dividing the number of gun deaths by the total state population and multiplying the result by 100,000 to obtain the rate per 100,000, which, according to the study, is the standard and accepted method for comparing fatal levels of gun violence.VCP analysts defined states with “strong” gun violence laws were defined as those that add significant state regulation that is absent from federal law, such as restricting access to hazardous and deadly types of firearms, setting minimum safety standards for firearms and/or requiring a permit to purchase a firearm, and restricting the open and concealed carrying of firearms in public.Channel 2 reached out to Alaska's National Rifle Association officials for comment but were unable to reach any in time for this report.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Chris Gifford, the black bear managed to enter the two story home through the front door, which it was able to do as the door knob was not working properly and allowed entry with minimal effort.Once inside, the bear and the home's residents remained on the first floor until local police arrived. The bear was spotted briefly in the front doorway, but retreated back inside after spotting arriving police.Two shots were fired at the animal, which fled behind the house and was found dead shortly after the incident. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game were notified and took the carcass."There were no injuries," Gifford said. "And there was no discernible damage to the residence."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

A diet lacking proper fluids can leave the skin weak and fragile; a poor diet on the whole can degrade your skin even more.And diseases such as diabetes can discolor skin or make it thicker.Even without complications, eating some foods is linked to poor skin.MayoClinic.comsays that a diet high in meat and full-fat milk can be related to wrinkles.Effects Of A Good DietEating a healthy diet can lead to healthy skin, according toHealthCentral.com.For example, the vitamin E in almonds and sunflower seeds supports the cells that protect the skin. The vitamin C in fruits, peppers and other vegetables contributes to the skin's production of collagen.Zinc and iron in meats and vitamin-enhanced cereals, meanwhile, help with cell production and oxygenation. And the vitamin A in certain vegetables keeps the skin smooth and protects it from the sun.Researchers have also found that whole grains can reduce acne. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and nuts can lead to fewer wrinkles, and the flavonols in dark chocolate lessen the skin's sensitivity to the sun.Fluids Help SkinAn article atHealth.Yahoo.comexplains the impact of getting enough water. Water is critical for the proper functioning of our bodies. Every single cell needs water to work correctly, and that includes skin cells. Water keeps your skin hydrated and helps to remove toxins.According toMayoClinic.com, the amount of water that a person needs varies by individual and is affected by other factors such as climate and the amount of exercise that an individual gets. General dietary recommendations suggest that men drink about 3 liters of liquids a day and women drink about 2.2 liters daily.It is important to remember that most diet-related skin conditions can be prevented or alleviated by following a healthy diet rich in the right nutrients, and by making sure you get enough water.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The numbers pale in comparison to women's cases, with about 1,500 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed among men annually and 400 men dying each year compared to numbers of 92,370 and 40,170 for women.One of the biggest problems is that most men, even doctors, don't recognize the signs of male breast cancer, according to Men's Health magazine. Men are almost more likely to not understand the three major risk factors: age (60 years or older), family history of the disease and obesity. Even one risk factor is a reason enough to do a quick self-exam every three months.Marriage Benefits Men More Than WomenThis debunking comes courtesy of David Popenoe, of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. Although it's often stated matter-of-factly that men get the lion's share of health benefits from marriage, that's not necessarily true, Popenoe says.Recent research indicates that men and women benefit about equally from marriage, although in different ways. Both men and women live longer, happier, healthier and wealthier lives when they are married.Men Don't Have Fertility CyclesAccording toAskmen.com, a man's sperm count is affected by the time of the year and the time of day.Generally sperm counts go up in the winter and down in the summer, possibly because sperm production is increased in cooler temperatures. A man's sperm count is also highest in the morning, matching the time when male hormone levels are also at their daily high.Shaving Causes Hair To Grow Back ThickerFor some reason this myth has endured for quite some time despite tons of evidence to the contrary. AsYahoo!tells us, as far back as 1928 a clinical trial showed that shaving had no affect on the thickness or rate or hair growth. Despite this being confirmed by many studies since, the myth won't go away.The reason behind the myth might be that shaved hair is blunt and doesn't taper at the ends, meaning it can look to be coarser. Plus, new hair can appear to be darker, but only because the sun hasn't had a chance to bleach it yet.Erectile Dysfunction Is All In Your HeadThe men's health websitewww.4-men.orgnotes that between 70 and 90 percent of men suffering from erectile dysfunction have an underlying physical cause for their impotence.Health problems, such as diabetes, heart conditions and trauma can lead to erectile dysfunction. Lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol and drug use can also add to the problem. So while psychological factors may play a role, erectile dysfunction is most-often a sign that something is wrong physically as well.Prostate Cancer Is An Old Man's DiseaseAsDummies.com, the website for the company behind those black and yellow "... For Dummies" books, tells us, younger men can also develop prostate cancer.Yes, men age 65 years old and older are at a higher risk for prostate cancer, but men in their 40s and 50s and even younger can also be diagnosed with the disease."If a younger man believes that you have to be old to die from prostate cancer, and then he is diagnosed with the disease, he may think that he doesn't have to worry," reports the website.

As we age, the lens of the eye loses its elasticity and its ability to change shape. While Chew says that the condition is inevitable, but she points out that it's fixable. You just need glasses.Macular degeneration, another age-related condition, is the leading cause of blindness in the U.S., accounting for 54 percent of all blindness according to Chew. Among Americans 55 and older, the percentage is much higher.The macula is the part of the retina that provides 20/20 vision explains Thomas Czyz, who sits on the Arizona Board of Optometry. In other words, it is the macula -- a mere 1.5 millimeters in diameter -- that allows us to see fine details.Think of a bull's eye on a dartboard. It's a bright, vibrant red when you first get it. Over time it can degenerate or wear out. The bull's eye has been hit too many times; it looks dull. This is the dry form of the disease, which results from a loss of pigmentation. In the other type, known as wet macular degeneration, blood fluid and protein break through the macula, one of the thinnest areas of retinal tissue, and cause massive damage, says Czyz.The risk of cataracts, a natural yellowing of the lens, also increases with age. Unlike macular degeneration, which is incurable, cataracts can be corrected with surgery. Ninety-five percent of patients, Chew says, can maintain 20/20 vision after a cataract operation if they don't have other diseases.Slowing DiseaseThere is even better news: Both macular degeneration and cataracts are in large part preventable. Indeed, according to Doug Hassenpflug, former chief of staff of Huhukam Memorial Hospital in Sacaton, Ariz., and an international lecturer on ocular diseases, there are things you can do to slow down the aging process in general.Nutrition is the key. The body is its most important pharmacy and has the best ability to heal itself.Diets, Chew agrees, are very important. Citing recent studies, she pointed out that people who ate the most green, leafy vegetables had the lowest chance of macular degeneration. In addition, eating fish twice a week reduced chances of macular degeneration by about 40 percent. This is all observational data, she cautions. It doesn't mean these dietary changes all by themselves will produce these results. They may be part of an overall lifestyle that is better for your eyes.All three doctors also strongly advise against smoking, which increases the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.Sunglasses can protect your lenses from UV rays. UV 400, polarized sunglasses are optimal, says Czyz.You should also have an annual exam once you are 65 to catch things that are treatable.Reduce your weight, says Chew, keep your blood pressure low.Regular exercise, Hassenpflug says, helps with cardiovascular stability, blood flow and circulation. This is helpful because a lot of eye disorders result from vascular problems. Is running five miles a day going to make you not need glasses? No, but it will help preserve your vision.While all three doctors agreed on the efficacy of antioxidants, Czyz recommended minerals you should be sure to get such as lutein; vitamins A, C and E; omega-3 fatty acids; and zinc.Prevention, insists Hassenpflug, is the key. Develop healthy habits, she said, becaue it  is always harder to reverse a disease than it is to prevent it from happening.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

The bear's two cubs were a short distance away.In a separate encounter involving wildlife, Alaska Department of Fish and Game officials say a man and his dog hiking along Prospect Heights Trail on their way up to Wolverine Peak ran into a pack of wolves on the Anchorage Hillside.Officials say the man initially turned and started jogging to get away, but the wolves gave chase. That's when they say he turned, stood his ground, and yelled at the wolves, freezing them in their tracks. The following day, Fish and Game says the man returned to retrieve the carcass of his dog that was killed with a bite to the neck.“If a wolf finds a wandering dog alone (in) its territory, it's not that unusual of a thing for them to kill it,” Battle said. “It's just something that wolves do sometimes.”Fish and Game officials say that incident occurred in early June. They say the Municipality of Anchorage typically has about four wolf packs roaming the area.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That total is expected to rise to between 400 and 500 people by the weekend, with another pair of helicopters joining four each water bomber air tankers and choppers already sent to battle the blaze.Flame retardant has already been dropped on the fire, with Allen saying crews have dug a fire line within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Fire officials have also issued a burn ban in the area, although it doesn’t include campfires.In Kasilof, one of two venues for community meetings convened Thursday night by Alaska Division of Forestry officials to brief residents. With the fire only 5 percent contained, a number of angry residents blasted firefighters’ response, asking why it didn’t come sooner. Some even offered their own bulldozers and construction equipment to help deployed fire crews work faster.The fire gave Amber Buffington's home on Pollard Loop home in Kasilof a little more breathing room Thursday, but it was a different story earlier in the week.“You got pine needles falling all over and ash falling down, smoke and the day is dark like night,” Buffington said. “It was pretty scary.”The flames abruptly come to a halt at the northwestern shores of Tustumena Lake, which the fire has left completely charred where greenery once joined the beach.Smoke jumpers from the Lower 48 and firefighters from across Alaska are helping with a ground attack.Despite all the chaos, Kenai resident John Morris was unfazed Thursday, and determined to enjoy a day on the lake with his family.“(I’m) just recreating, not at work -- I got my two weeks off from my job, so I want to come down, do some fishing and just relax,” Morris said.Allen says no areas are currently under evacuation orders due to Funny River, with no reports of the flames spreading to any homes.Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Recipe Tip<COL>U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish is raised in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  Although "born" in the South, it's truly the all-American fish and is available nationwide all year long.  Its firm texture keeps it from flaking or falling apart, making it ideal for the grill.And the mild, slightly sweet flavor of the American-grown product quickly absorbs the flavors of marinades, spices, and salsas.  U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish is delicious, safe, and easy to cook.  You're Gonna Love It.For the salsa2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup diced mango 1 cup diced papaya 1 tablespoon minced green onion 1 tablespoon minced jalapeño chiliFor the fish1 teaspoon finely minced garlic  ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon pepper ¼ teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne), or to taste 4 (6 to 7 ounces each) U.S. farm-raised catfish fillets (see Tip) 2 teaspoons olive oilTo make the salsa, stir together the lime juice and honey in a medium bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir gently until evenly combined.  Set aside.When you are ready to cook the fish, position the rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the grill or broiler.  Stir together the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper.Brush each fish fillet with olive oil and sprinkle with about ½ teaspoon of the spice mixture.  Grill or broil the fish for about 6 minutes.  Turn and cook for 4 to 6 minutes longer or until the fish is cooked through (see Tip).Top each serving with about ½ cup of the fruit salsa.Paulette Mitchell, a culinary instructor, television personality, spokesperson, freelance food writer, and the award-winning author of 13 cookbooks, is known internationally for her quick-to-prepare recipes with gourmet flair.

If the levels are close to the cutoff criteria, the American Heart Association conducts its own lab testing to verify that the product's nutritional content.There are three kinds of certification that can be obtained, each based on the nutrition content of a single serving size,  as determined by the manufacturer.The first level is standard certification. To be granted this certification, products must contain 3 g or less of total fat, 1 g or less of saturated fat, less than 0.5 g of trans fat, 20 mg or less of cholesterol, 480 mg or less of sodium, and 10 percent or more of the daily value of one of six vitamins and minerals: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or dietary fiber.The second level of certification that can be obtained is whole grains certification. The food must meet the same criteria as the standard certification -- except the total fat content, which is allowed to be as high as 6.5 g -- and the product must contain a certain proportion of dietary fiber and 51 percent whole grains by weight.The third level of certification is whole-oats soluble fiber certification. It must meet the same criteria as the standard certification except the amount of total fat, which is not considered if it is derived from whole-oat sources alone. If the total fat is derived from non-whole-oat sources, the cutoff is 3 g. The product must also contain 0.75 g or more of whole-oat soluble fiber.Meat, which is considered under different criteria, have to meet U.S. Department of Agriculture standards for "extra lean" and contain less than 5 g total fat, less than 2 g saturated fat, less than 95 mg cholesterol, less than 0.5 g trans fat, 480 mg or less sodium, and at least 10 percent of one of the following: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or dietary fiber. However, the American Heart Association does not certify beef ribeye or strip steaks.The heart-check mark is an indicator of very specific components in the foods that apply for certification. Products should be taken as a whole, and consumers should still examine product labels to make informed decisions about the food.Remember, the mark does not take into account any heart unhealthy components that may be present in the products. Products that pass the above criteria may still contain high levels of sugar, have a high caloric content or lack important vitamins.A heart healthy diet can be achieved by following the D.A.S.H program, which is rich in fruits and vegetables, low in sodium and simple carbohydrates, and includes whole grains, high-fiber foods, lean meats and poultry, fish, and fat-free or 1 percent fat dairy products.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Four days later, the couple hadn’t made it back.<COL>Courtesy Coast GuardWhen a couple from Ketchikan on a boating trip departed from Knudson Cove Marina on June 19, they were expected back four days later. When those four days came and passed, the couple had not yet returned.The overdue boaters, Patricia Bishop, 63, and Kenneth Wright, 65, left in their 20-foot skiff for a planned camping trip along the Unuk River. The couple had made it a point to share a float plan that stated the couple would leave on June 19 and return to Ketchikan before 4 p.m. on June 23, according to Troopers.When they never returned Coast Guard, Alaska State Troopers and Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squadron crews were mobilized to search for the wayward boaters.According to Alaska State Troopers, an assortment of aircraft and watercraft assets were launched in an attempt to locate Bishop and Wright.After about a day of searching the couple was located, June 24, on a beach along the Unuk by a KVRS airplane, according to Troopers. KVRS crews relayed the coordinates of the boaters to Coast Guard crews who dispatched a helicopter to the scene to recover the Ketchikan residents."This case was a success because the boaters filed a float plan, and we knew where to focus our search and rescue efforts," said Nick Meyer, a Sector Juneau operations unit watchstander in a written statement. "The support we received from the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad and Alaska Department of Fish and Game allowed us to cover more area to quickly locate the missing boaters."Bishop and Wright were transported back to Ketchikan, uninjured, Troopers said.Following their ordeal, Bishop and Wright explained to investigators the couple experienced a mishap on June 21 while aboard their vessel, according to Troopers. The mishap forced the two to swim to shore where they were able to start a fire and erect a tent.Troopers noted the boaters managed to construct an orange florescent “X” on the beach, a common signal for distress, which the KVRS aircraft was able to see.Coast Guard footage reveals the moment Bishop and Wright were rescued.

Preston Michaels was reported missing last winter.“He was staying across the river at one of the fishing camps and he was reported missing,” Achee said.The body will be sent to the state medical examiner’s office in Anchorage for a positive identification and determination of cause of death.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.<COL>iStock/YinYangByMayo Clinic News NetworkA well-planned vegetarian diet can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.When people think about a vegetarian diet, they typically think about a diet that doesn't include meat, poultry or fish. But vegetarian diets vary in what foods they include and exclude:Some people follow a semi-vegetarian diet — also called a flexitarian diet — which is primarily a plant-based diet but includes meat, dairy, eggs, poultry and fish on occasion or in small quantities.A healthy diet takes planning, and a food pyramid can be a helpful tool. The vegetarian pyramid outlines food groups and food choices that, if eaten in the right quantities, form the foundation of a healthy vegetarian diet.The key to a healthy vegetarian diet — like any diet — is to enjoy a variety of foods. No single food can provide all the nutrients your body needs. The more restrictive your diet is, the more challenging it can be to get all the nutrients you need. A vegan diet, for example, eliminates natural food sources of vitamin B-12, as well as milk products, which are good sources of calcium.With a little planning, however, you can be sure that your diet includes everything your body needs. Pay special attention to the following nutrients:If you need help creating a vegetarian diet that's right for you, talk with your doctor and a registered dietitian.If you're not following a vegetarian diet but you're thinking of trying it, here are some ideas to help you get started:Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446/?pg=2No email address was supplied by.

They hung around for a little bit, drawing some onlookers who kept their distance.Frank Lowe who lives near the greenbelt said he had not seen these specific bears before, but each time bears drop by, he gets a little concerned."There's not too many alternatives if they turn into problem bears, and I hope that doesn't happen," Lowe said.Fish and Game officials received several reports of sightings of the sow and cubs, according to Battle. So far they have not shown any signs of aggressive behavior, he added.Fish and Game officials say they will continue to monitor the three bears but for now, the bears seem to be staying near the wooded area and just outside the perimeter. Fish and Game reminds residents to secure their trash cans.While black bears do not defend their food sources from humans like brown bears do, Battle warns people to not get too close to the bears.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

These subgroups could not be differentiated by routine pathology but only with the aid of novel genetic tests, which the research team recommends giving to all patients with ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Findingsare publishedin the journalBlood.Patients whose lymphomas hadTP63rearrangements had only a 17 percent chance of living five years beyond diagnosis, compared to 90 percent of patients whose tumors hadDUSP22rearrangements. A third group of tumors, those with neither rearrangement, was associated with an intermediate survival rate.“This is the first study to demonstrate unequivocal genetic and clinical heterogeneity among systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas,” saysAndrew L. Feldman, M.D., a Mayo Clinic pathologist and senior author on the multi-institutional study. “Most strikingly, patients withDUSP22-rearranged ALCL had excellent overall survival rates, while patients withTP63-rearranged ALCL had dismal outcomes and nearly always failed standard therapy.” Dr. Feldman also is aDamon Runyon Clinical Investigator.ALCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but one of the more common subtypes of T-cell lymphoma, according to theLymphoma Research Foundation. ALCL comprises about three percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 10 to 30 percent of all cases in children. Currently, all ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas are treated the same, using chemotherapy and, in some institutions, stem cell transplantation. Results from the study make a clear case for additional testing and possible changes standard of care.“This is a great example of where individualized medicine can make a difference,” says Dr. Feldman. “Patients whose chance of surviving is 1 in 6 are receiving the same therapy as patients whose odds are 9 in 10. Developing tests that identify how tumors are different is a critical step toward being able to tailor therapy to each individual patient.”TP63andDUSP22rearrangements are examples of abnormal swapping of DNA that disturbs the way genes are arranged on a tumor cell’s chromosomes. These abnormalities cannot be seen in the standard microscopic evaluation that pathologists use to diagnose lymphoma, but can be visualized using a genetic test called fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH). The authors of the study recommend performing FISH in all patients with ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

If you have food allergies or if you handle and prepare food for anyone who does, learn how to recognize allergens on food labels.You will find labels on all packaged foods made in the United States. They're also on all imported packaged foods that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates.The law requires food manufacturers to print separately, at the bottom of the ingredients list, eight of the most common food allergens:If you or anyone in your family is allergic to gluten, make sure any packaged food you buy is specifically labeled "gluten-free." The FDA requires that these foods meet a specified standard for gluten content.Cross-contamination can occur when foods are produced in the same facility. However, the FDA doesn't require manufacturers to state that allergens could've made their way into foods that aren't meant to contain them. So when reading food labels, look out for these phrases that may indicate possible cross-contamination:Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/in-depth/understand-food-labels-avoid-allergic-reactions/art-20088119/No email address was supplied by.

She was 19. He was 20.Bruce joined the Navy and became a pilot. He rose through the ranks to become a commander. She stayed home to raise two children.After 20 years of flying, Bruce retired and moved north with his wife.“We came up to Alaska and pursued our dreams,” James said.In 2007, they settled in the Copper River Valley, where Bruce taught children to hunt and fish. Kayane opened a bed and breakfast on an eight-acre property that doesn’t have electricity or running water.They called it Alaska Halfway House -- “because we’re halfway between Chitina and McCarthy,” James said. “It’s where the committed go to enjoy the wilderness. That’s our slogan.”Bruce built a cabin, which they called Halfway to Paradise.“It’s just breath-taking,” James said. “It’s everybody’s dream and we’re living it.”In 2011 came a startling discovery.“Bruce had a mole on his back,” James said. “I was worried about it. He was, too.”They drove six hours to the Anchorage Veterans Administration clinic in Muldoon, and saw a doctor who said she had to refer Bruce’s case to Seattle.“She examined him and said, ‘This is the way things are done here: I have to make a referral to Seattle, and then they will send a physician assistant up to Anchorage to take a picture of the mole,'" James said. "'And then that person will fly back to Seattle (and) arrange a review with doctors to take a look at the photo that she took.'"Only after that remote diagnosis, James says, would the clinic treat her husband."And then if that mole needed to come off, they would fly that person back up to remove the mole,” James said. “She said, ‘Now, be patient because this process takes a little bit of time.’”Days, weeks, then months went by. Bruce made numerous calls.“He was always told, ‘No, we haven’t heard back from them. Wait a little longer’,” James said. “When you’re with the military, you’re taught to be patient because things don’t move quickly all the time. He followed orders; he had a lot of faith in the VA health system and the government.”Bruce eventually reached the doctor who made the referral.“She investigated and got back to him and said that she found her referral sitting on an abandoned desk, untouched,” Kayane said, crying. “The referral was never made. Three months was lost at that time.”Kayane said it took two more months to remove, then test the mole for its placement on a four-stage scale of cancers. Higher numbers indicate more aggressively advanced cases.“It came back Stage 3, almost Stage 4, melanoma -- metastatic melanoma,” she said. “Here’s the kicker of it all: After we got that diagnosis, they referred Bruce to a local dermatologist in Anchorage.”By then, the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes.Despite surgery, radiation and drugs, James says the melanoma spread within two years to her husband’s brain.“He goes, ‘I want you to keep fighting my claim for the delay of treatment. Remember, keep fighting.’ That was the last time Bruce talked,” James said. “He never spoke again.”Bruce passed away June 8, 2013. He was 59 years old.A year later, his widow is still fighting.“I’ve got seven denials, seven denials,” James said. “That’s all I get is denials.”First was the VA’s denial that her late husband’s cancer is linked to his military service, though studies, like one from Iceland, show pilots are more likely to get melanoma.In late June, James says she received word that the VA granted her appeal to link the melanoma to sun exposure during his military flying career, which means she’s eligible for dependent compensation. She's still awaiting the official documents, however.Another VA document shows there was, indeed, a delay in diagnosis. A VA doctor even apologized for the delay. But in other documents, the VA denied the delay made a difference in the progression of the disease.“He died because of all the mistakes and errors that he got in his treatment at the VA clinic,” James said. “He had a five-month delay. If, maybe -- maybe if that mole would have been removed sooner, he’d be here today.”A recent national audit by the VA shows no one in Alaska died while waiting for care.“That hurt me deeply because my husband died,” James said. “Why did they not have his name? Were they hiding it?”Samuel Hudson with the Alaska VA declined to speak about Bruce James' case or any other individual case, citing the VA’s privacy policies. He did, however, cite the results of the audit.“If you remember the report came out talking about the VA, we had a team come up, a four-man team, that did an assessment of the VA, an access assessment and they said we did pretty well,” Hudson said. “Are we perfect? By no means, no. But is it our intent to take care of our veterans? Without a doubt, yes.”Kayane James said the VA’s errors and delays cost her husband his life, taking away a father, husband and friend.“If Bruce were here, he would say, ‘Please make this right for another veteran. They should never have to go through what I’ve been through. Fix it,’” James said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Fountain drinks are $3.60 apiece.Lunchbox: Hard Rock Cafe AnchorageHard Rock Cafe Anchorage415 E St.$13-$32 per plate11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday907-274-7625http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/anchorage/With the city’s newest restaurantthrowing a gala celebration in Downtown Anchorage last weekend,I thought I’d slip in before the Fourth of July weekend to see how it holds up to the hype.The Hard Rock Cafe occupies a prominent corner property that used to house Rumrunner’s Old Towne Bar and Grill, whichclosed in 2012after a pair ofviolentincidents.It briefly reopened last year as the Bear Paw Restaurant, an establishmentso much tamer than Rumrunner’s it was devoid of personality,before closing once again to undergo its metamorphosis into a Hard Rock location. Much of the exterior remains recognizably Rumrunner’s, right down to the brick tower holding the marquee. Remembering the massive crowds at the opening of Anchorage’s first Olive Garden, I drove into town at 11 a.m. sharp expecting the worst…only to find a parking space 50 feet from the door, no line and a mix of tourists and locals ambling in as casually as if the restaurant had been there a decade. My mother joined me soon after I took a table, for a second opinion on how Hard Rock fits into the Downtown dining scene.The most revolutionary changes since the Rumrunner’s days have occurred inside the building. The bouncer checkpoint has given way to a densely staffed greeter station, with a small “Rock Shop” of merchandise bearing the restaurant’s logo tucked away into a corner. Only a modest row of booths now marks the bar’s old location, with a new one built as a large island that accommodates seats on three sides; a mix of lights and frosted-glass panes dangling above it creates a stylized aurora borealis. Rumrunner’s second bar and dancing area on the main floor has been broken up into a kitchen and crew spaces, but the first-floor dining area’s mix of bar seating, booths and tables seemed up to the task of handling lunchtime traffic. Memorabilia from acts like David Lee Roth, Soundgarden and Quiet Riot adorns the walls as memorable décor in glass cases. As I looked at an elevated hybrid stage/seating area which used to be the old DJ/dancer stand, Mom pointed out that the windows were larger than they had been before: “It makes it nice and light here in the day.” Hardwood floors look good but lead to raucous acoustics, with TVs playing music videos and the unbroken single room leading to a noise level much like that of the Glacier Brewhouse; the noise occasionally hits Rumrunner’s levels when staff ask patrons to shout “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” for a diner, which happened three times during our visit and my mother ultimately deemed “excruciating.”Thus far, lunch at the Hard Rock appears to be a limited menu -- paging through it, we were greeted with three salads and no soups on offer, followed by about half a dozen dinner-sized beef, fish and fajita entree options. Hard Rock’s two core selections include about half a dozen barbecue items in plate and sandwich form, as well as a similar number of half-pound “Legendary” burgers backed by a few other sandwich types. While each Hard Rock offers a unique “Local Legendary” burger you have to ask the server about (ours is topped with reindeer sausage), I instead asked a photo offering “pulled hickory smokehouse brisket” I couldn’t find on the menu, only to have the waitress confirm that none is actually sold here. I was still drawn to the barbecue page by my suspicion that the kitchen’s personality rested there, so I ordered a Texan sandwich ($12.95); Mom was somewhat put off by the burgers’ size and instead opted for a honey mustard chicken sandwich ($12.95). She’d also perused the beverage menu more closely than I had, putting in an order for a nonalcoholic Berrilicious ($4), which she found similar to an orange-strawberry daiquiri: “It's really tasty -- may be a little too filling to go with a full sandwich.” With the restaurant filling up she had a fair amount of time to drink it, as our food came out in just under 25 minutes.Alone among sandwiches on the menu, the Texan offers a $4 “go-big” charge to double its meat portion from five ounces to 10; I didn’t do so and still found the sandwich intimidating, the large bun seeming to suitably match the higher prices. As a pulled-pork sandwich with upgrades, I thought the towering mass of fried jalapeno slices and onion strings would dominate the sandwich, but I was surprised to find the chipotle barbecue sauce fighting back against their influence on my tongue. Rich and tangy, overflowing from the sides of the bun with every bite, the sauce was warm without being hot, moderating the vegetables and counterbalancing them in a way a burger patty simply doesn’t when they’re placed upon one at other restaurants -- even before the addition of cheddar and Jack cheese which melted onto the pork, I found the blend more than the sum of its parts and a pleasant treat. The sandwich also draws a full barbecue-plate sampler of sides, ranging from a generous Red Robin-style portion of steak fries (peppered, served hot, delicious) to a citrus coleslaw (delightfully tangy, with unexpected power from chopped green onion) and a cup of cowboy beans (bland, lacking spice, might as well have been refried).Always wary of too-heavy food, Mom immediately took a wary look under the hood of her chicken sandwich, nodding in approval at the generous amount of lettuce and tomato stacked atop the Dijon dressing on the bun’s base, then peeling off one of its two strips of bacon crossed atop the chicken breast and slice of Jack cheese within. “The chicken's moist and tender, not overcooked; brioche bun is good,” she noted between bites, even reversing her opinion on the bacon by adding it back in: “The saltiness of the bacon is really helping the sandwich.” By the time she was finished she declared the sandwich good, turning a slightly more critical eye to the imbalance between her accompanying pile of fries (“Portion size is way too big…this is almost more food than the sandwich”) and serving of citrus coleslaw (“This is a beef I have with restaurants why do they serve coleslaw in a thimble?”). That said, only a few fries survived by the time she was finished and the waitress took her plate.It can be a little hard to justify the Hard Rock’s initial price points, given its competition in the Downtown area, but the food we ate was excellent and offers the promise of great things. While the rock-music premise is well-executed, as you’d expect from such a widespread brand, its level of allure varies widely from person to person; in my case, I’d recommend buying a T-shirt if that’s what you’re visiting for. The restaurant definitely has plans to fit into the community, though, with our waitress mentioning plans to use the indoor stage for acts during a block-party grand opening in September, and as it gets settled a meal at the Hard Rock is likely to become a soft sell.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Check out these tips to stay safe at your picnic or cookout.<COL>iStockByMayo Clinic News NetworkAs the temperature rises, so does our excitement over picnics and grilling. Unfortunately, cases of foodborne illness rise too.Most people know to keep potato salad cold. But there's more to food safety. Consider the following food for thought as you plan your summer outings.Check the forecast.You know to refrigerate perishable food within two hours. But did you know that drops to one hour when the temperature is above 90 F (32 C)? Serve, eat and get food back in the cooler.Come clean.If your picnic spot doesn't have clean running water, bring some with you. Bring wipes or sanitizing gel for surfaces and hands. Wash hands before food prep and after handling raw meats.Keep your cool.Use an insulated cooler with ice, ice packs or partially frozen items to keep food at 40 F (4 C) or cooler.Pack smart.Keep separate coolers for food and beverages. Chances are people will be in and out of the beverage cooler, which lets cold air escape. To keep food as cold as possible, keep that cooler closed until you're ready to cook. Pack meat in plastic and put it on the bottom of the cooler to prevent it from leaking on other foods. Pack two platters — one for raw meat and one for cooked meat.Use a thermometer.Don't rely on the color of meat to judge when it's cooked enough. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature. Safe minimum temperatures are:So enjoy the warmer weather but keep food safety in mind as you pack your picnic cooler or fire up the grill.Source:http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-blog/summer-food-safety/bgp-20056152No email address was supplied by.

Susan Koch, owner ofAnimal Crackersin Greenfield, Mass., offers up advice on the range of possibilities.Small lizards, snakes, and frogsKoch especially recommends the African Clawed Frog for the simplest, easiest pet to have in your home. “Their requirements are really low. They have been found living under ice and in very hot environments,” she said. Koch added that the frogs are maintained in a small tank, eat pellets and live approximately five to 10 years. “You just have to be careful with the bowl or tank and clean it out routinely,” said Koch.Koch said other easy-to-maintain pets include Fire Belly Toads, and other small lizards. “They are very popular. Just keep a clean dish of water in their tank for them to drink and bathe in and a little place to hide,” said Koch. Koch said that the only maintenance issues might be feeding live crickets and bugs to toads and small reptiles (if the crickets escape), and a little extra use of electricity for a small lamp for the pet’s warmth.Snakes have similar needs, but eat rodents. The only difficulty you might encounter is if they manage to get loose. If your snake does get loose, be certain they will look for someplace warm to hide out.FishWhile hobbyists may spend lots of time cleaning tanks and filters for their fish, there is minimal impact on your home, unless a tank breaks. “Along these lines a Beta is very easy to keep. Once a week you clean up their water and you are good to go,” said Koch.Ferrets and small rodents“Mice (also hamsters and gerbils) are easy keepers, but you don’t want to let them get loose. The little devils chew, boy do they chew,” said Koch. "With small rodents, mostly you just need to keep the cage clean." The number of small rodents you have in the cage or tank will determine how often you will need to clean in order to avoid unpleasant odors.“Ferrets are more of a presence in your home. They can be quite ‘odorific,’” said Koch with a laugh. “Their aim (when urinating) isn’t always the best either,” she said. Koch described another possible problem when keeping a ferret in your home. Ferrets need time out of the cage to explore and get exercise. “You just have to watch out for them getting into little places and making it theirs,” she said.Koch told an antidote about her own pet ferret she owned as a teen and the mess and odor the ferret left behind in a small couch she had in her bedroom. She said, “Ferrets sweat and they always have a musky smell to them. They need to be shampooed regularly or they get really gamey.”Birds“The little guys, the smaller they are, the more stuff they kick around. Their poops tend to travel pretty far too,” said Koch. Koch said that larger birds can cause more significant damage to a home if not properly trained from a young age. “Thebigger birds, you have to really watch them, they will chew your woodwork if they are given latitude,” said Koch. Koch recommends conditioning the bird to chew other toys and objects. “The bigger they are it’s a good idea to have a tree for them to hang out in,” said Koch.Cats“Thelitter boxis always an issue,” said Koch. The litter, besides smelling if you don’t keep up with it, can get dragged around the house and even into your bedding. In addition, Koch said that other effects on your home will include cleaning up after shedding and training the cat to not scratch furniture. Koch recommended a type of sticky pad that can be placed on the edges of furniture as cats don’t like the feel of them. “Of course, some people just use squirt guns to train their cats not to scratch furniture or climb on kitchen counters,” said Koch.Dogs“I love dogs, but they are hard on a house, and they are going to make a mess. The bigger the dog, the bigger the mess,” said Koch. Besides dealing with shedding (some dogs, such as poodles, do not shed), dogs can cause a lot of damage towood floorsdue to the hardness of their nails. Keeping their nails clipped helps with this problem.A much greater problem can arise if your dog has anxiety issues. They will dig, burrow, chew, and generally create a path of destruction if they are afraid of storms or have separation issues. “I had one dog that was afraid of thunder and ended up taking out a whole door casing,” said Koch. Having a kennel or crate for your dog can help you avoid these types of problems.Naturally, as a dog owner you will need to be aware of theirbathroom needs. I don’t think that kind of mess and damage needs to be overstated. “You can leave a cat alone, they are very independent. But dogs have to depend on you to be able to get out to pee and poop,” said Koch.“All these are potential problems. But they are not problems if you don’t let them happen,” said Koch.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/which-house-pets-are-easiest-on-your-homNo email address was supplied by.

And it was during a run near her home in Indian three days after this Fourth of July that the longtime Alaskan was seriously injured by a brown bear sow and two cubs.Suzanne Knudsen heads toward the finish line in Downtown Seward. (Jeff Rivet KTUU-TV)THE ATTACKMonday morning Knudsen was jogging alone along Bird Creek Trail on the way to Penguin Peak – amid Chugach State Park, slightly closer to Girdwood than Anchorage – when she came across a brown bear sow and two cubs.Knudsen told emergency responders one of the cubs appeared from brush about 10 yards up the trail. It rushed her way, and almost immediately she was hit from behind by the sow."It seems like a case of a surprising a brown bear sow with cubs at very close range, which is a very classic defensive attack," said Jessy Coltrane, a wildlife biologist for the Department of Fish and Game. "It's usually a very quick and violent attack, but it's usually just a couple of swats and bites."That sounds about like the incident Coltrane described. She said Knudsen suffered “serious” injuries to her back and bites and puncture wounds to her neck, and the bears disappeared into the woods almost immediately."People have died from attacks like this," Coltrane said. "She's very lucky."The luck came in a few forms.Knudsen had cellphone reception and was able to call 911, and even before a trooper arrived from Girdwood, a group of tourists participating in a three-hour tour operated by Alaska ATV Adventures happened by.An employee hustled back to the parking lot to wait for help to arrive and then let the responding trooper borrow an ATV to make it to the scene of the attack.Knudsen was transported to Providence Alaska Medical Center where on Monday she was receiving emergency medical treatment for injuries not considered life-threatening.Whatever led to the attack, that Knudsen is recovering is good news, but Coltrane said at the height of summer when bear encounters most likely, the incident also serves as a reminder for anyone venturing into the wilderness.'SHE'S RUN INTO BEARS BEFORE'Barney Griffith is a mountain runner and longtime friend of Knudsen, who he called passionate, tough and unique."She's not afraid of anything," Griffith said. "She likes her friends, real outgoing but at the same time she is a real private person, likes to be alone too."The pursuit of solitude could be part of what makes Bird Ridge and Penguin Peak favorite spots for Knudsen, Griffith said, but it is also what put her on top of a sow protecting its cubs."There's a lot less people, and there's more dangers with weather, with bears, with moose," Griffith said of the trail. "She's run into bears before, she absolutely knows the risks."Running alone in the area is considered dangerous, and state wildlife officials said Knudsen made two other risky decisions: wearing earbuds and carrying no bear deterrent in bear country.Coltrane repeated Alaska mantras: "Travel in groups, make a lot of noise, carry bear spray," she said. "Also, do not wear anything that might impede your ability to hear, like earbuds."Griffith said his friend is tough and the he expects her to be back in the wilderness soon after she heals."She's been in these situations before that have shaken her up, and she always comes back," he said. "I expect her to be out there very soon."In accordance with Department of Fish and Game policy, Bird Creek Trail will be closed for a week while wildlife biologists monitor the area and investigate the incident.Channel 2's Corey Allen-Young and Blake Essig contributed to this story.Editor's Note: Suzanne Knudsen could not be reached for comment.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

It's meant to be a time to commune with "God," "The Creator," or whatever your concept of a higher being may be. A Vision Quest is usually done alone on top of a mountain, or in a secluded spot in nature where you will not be interrupted or have any distractions. It is a pretty intense undertaking, but the personal rewards can be immense.In order to get ready for the 4 days during which I would be alone on my Vision Quest -- eating no food and drinking no water, with the exception of some sage tea if it became absolutely necessary at any point -- I had to emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually prepare myself. I began my preparations a year prior to the actual Vision Quest. As far as the official instructions for preparations went, I was to observe the following:Regarding that last point, the only vice that I had was my addiction to coffee; and I call it an addiction because I was convinced that I needed coffee in order to function. My work at the time required that I be at the office, brain in rapid-fire mode, by 7:00 a.m. Back then, there were no fancy coffee shops around every corner (like Starbucks is today) so I'd hit up the 7-11 and start my day with a 24 oz. cup at about 6:45 a.m. At 7:30, I'd move on down to the 20 oz.; then the 16 oz. around 9:00 a.m.; and finally, I'd wrap it all up with a quick eight ounces at 10:00 a.m. (All the while feeling pretty darn good about myself that I was drinking less and less as the morning progressed.)This was my Monday-Friday routine. On the weekends I still drank coffee, but it was nowhere near that amount. When I was told that I would have to give up coffee, my one vice, I was horror-stricken. The chief who led the Vision Quest ceremony calmly and in a very matter-of-fact way asked, "Well, it is a vice, isn't it?" I soberly nodded. He said, "Then you get to give it up." After two full weeks of the most excruciating headaches, the shakes, the worst moods ever, the loss of a couple of friendships (which I later regained), I had escaped the claws of coffee. If this sounds like someone detoxing from the worst of narcotics … well, this is what I imagine that must feel like. Those two weeks were just awful. But I knew that I had to go through it in order to be fully able to prepare for my Vision Quest, so I did. And once I got past the coffee hurdle, the remainder of the preparation schedule was practically a breeze. The Vision Quest itself is a whole other blog post ….Anyway, after my Vision Quest was over, I maintained a vegetarian diet, still including fish, for close to 5 years. I also kept up with many of the other practices that I was taught when preparing for my Quest. It was during this time that I rediscovered tea and fell in love with it. A cup of black tea has, on average, 1/3 the amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, and I could definitely feel the difference. But in the end, it made me feel better overall. Tea to me felt a lot more gentle on the system. It even provided a relaxing side-effect which was very different, in a good way, from the energy overload that coffee can give. What I didn't realize when I was all hopped up on coffee was that I was actually getting the jitters every single day; I was so incredibly hyper in the mornings, I was practically buzzing around the office. No more. Today I don't only drink black tea; I also enjoy green tea for the antioxidant benefit, chamomile before bed, and a variety of herbal teas as well.Now that it's been a good 14 years since my Vision Quest and my departure from daily coffee consumption, when I do have some every once in a while, I notice that even if I just have a regular-sized cup, I can actually feel it surging through my system. I don't like that feeling; I much prefer the gentle approach that tea has. There have been quite a few studies lately showing the benefits of coffee. For example, how coffee may ward off prostate cancer in men, and how it may fend off aggressive varieties of breast cancer. Just a few days ago, in fact, there was yet another, on how it can prevent depression in women. So for the health benefits alone, I'm not willing to say I'll never have another cup of coffee again. But what I think that particular lesson was about for me, was just to be conscious of what holds power over me and my life. I am a very firm believer that you can do fine if you have everything in moderation.Source: Pure MattersDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Eating a healthful diet helps keep your body strong and can help reduce your risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and osteoporosis. Studies even show a link between healthful eating and longevity."As we age, the body becomes less efficient at absorbing some key nutrients. Appetite and taste can suffer from loss of sense of smell and taste or from side effects of medications. Bad teeth can make some foods difficult to chew or digest," said Arthur Hayward, MD, a geriatrician and the clinical lead physician for elder care with Kaiser Permanente's Care Management Institute. "So choosing foods carefully is smart."Here are five tips to help you get the nutrition your body needs:1. Avoidempty calories.Foods with empty calories may contain very few vitamins and minerals. "Convenience foods," such as packaged snacks, chips and sodas, are common sources of empty calories. Avoid the "bad" carbs -- foods that have white flour, refined sugar and white rice.2. Choose nutrient-rich foods.Eat a variety of foods. The more you vary the foods you eat, the more vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you get. For example:* Eat lots of fruits and vegetables -- Choose fresh, frozen or no-salt canned vegetables and fruits in their own juice or light syrup.* Eat foods with protein -- Protein is found in lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs and cheese, cooked beans, peanut butter and nuts and seeds.* Get enough calcium and vitamin D -- Calcium and vitamin D are found in milk and milk products, including yogurt and cheese. They are also in green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens) and tofu.* Include foods high in vitamin B12 -- After 50, the body produces less gastric acid and absorbs less B12, which helps keep blood and nerves vital. B12 is found in milk, meat, poultry, fish and eggs.* Eat high-fiber foods -- This includes fruits, vegetables, cooked dried beans and whole grains.3. Drink plenty of fluids.Drink plenty of fluids -- enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water. Fiber and fluids help with constipation.4. If your appetite is poor.Try eating smaller meals, several times a day, instead of one or two large meals. Eating while socializing with others may help your appetite. You might also ask about changing medicines. Medication can cause appetite or taste problems.5. Eat soft foods.As we approach our senior years, chewing food is sometimes difficult. Choose low-sodium canned vegetables or cooked fruits and vegetables. These are often softer. Chop or shred meat, poultry or fish. Add sauce or gravy to the meat to help keep it moist.In addition to eating a balanced diet, aim for 150 minutes of physical activity each week. Ten-minute sessions several times a day on most days are fine. For questions or advice about a specific condition, talk with your physician.No email address was supplied by.

Another specialist then took an X-ray of a red Elmo doll and found an "anomaly" inside. The doll was cut open and two live parrots were found inside.The birds and fruit were seized by border agents.Officials said the mangos were destroyed on site.The birds were placed in a quarantine isolation crate and transferred to a federal bird holding facility.According to border officials, all imported birds, except from Canada, must be in quarantine for 30 days with proper documentation of its health. Birds may also be subject to health regulations by the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Services. Officials said birds are regulated because they can carry bacterial and viral diseases.The couple was fined $300, which they agreed to pay by mail, and released.No email address was supplied by.

It’s not only fun, it’s also green; if you live in a sweltering state like Texas, cooking outdoors will take a load off your HVAC. Nowadays home chefs can cook almost anything on the grill. Here are some of the season’s niftiest BBQ accessories to help.Pans and RacksMesh or perforated stainless steel pans are available to perform a multitude of culinary tasks -- not only grilling, but also frying, griddling or roasting. You can even tackle two whole chickens at a time with a device that holds them vertically.BONUS: these pans are generally dishwasher safe.How about a dedicated pot to keep your secret dipping sauce good ‘n’ hot? Tryone that you can put directly on the grill surface– it’s made to withstand temperatures as high as 1000 degrees F!If your idea of a good time is spending summer Saturday nights baking bread, you’ll find loaf pans purpose-built to sit atop your grill.For traditional campfire-style “baked” potatoes without using foilorlosing a spud or two among the coals, buy a rack ... or an all-in-one grill roaster with potato clips on the side. Other interesting specialty racks include one designed for roasting stuffed jalapeno peppers as a sizzling appetizer or side.Stone and SaltWith the help of a special pizza stone, your grill will achieve what your home oven cannot – reach the high heat necessary to bake pizza right. Enjoy the deliciously crisp crust that you know and love from restaurants with traditional brick ovens.A smoking stone encourages air circulation all around your slab of protein. At the same time, the beef, pork, poultry or fish is protected from direct contact with the grill’s heat by this heavy-duty ceramic or cast iron plate, allowing it to develop a rich smoky savor.TheHimalayan salt platelooks intriguing. Placed directly on the grill at up to 450 degrees F, it retains heat and grills meat or seafood evenly, imparting a unique flavor.

It has 777 rooms. State Rooms in the palace are open to visitors during the summer months.By Laura Firszt,NetworxA fence can be installed for a number of reasons – privacy, security, decoration, noise reduction or keeping livestock in and unwanted visitors out.  From simple mud walls to high tech virtual barriers, various forms of fencing are used by people across cultures and countries. Here are seven examples of the world’s most famous fences.1. Great Wall of China.Although not technically a fence due to the solidity of its construction, the Great Wall of China is the world’s most famous defensive barrier. Deserving of an honorable mention for both its age – close to 3 millennia – and its size – the Wall and its branches which twist and turn along China’s northern border total some 13,000 miles in length.2. Dingo Fence.Currently the longest true fence on Earth at approximately 3,400 miles, Australia’sdingo fencewas built in the 1880s to protect sheep on southern Queensland ranches from attacks by wild dogs. Although the fence succeeded in its planned function, there was also an unfortunate side effect. Removal of the canine predators allowed the kangaroo population to grow excessively and compete with sheep flocks for grazing space.3. Fence at Buckingham Palace.The fence at Buckingham Palace in London, England, serves a dual purpose. Not only is it intended to protect the British royal family in their home (although a fewintrudershave breached the fortification over the years), the fence’s elegant cast iron stakes topped with elaborate gilded fleurs-de-lis make it a symbol of majesty. The White House’s plainer security fence pales in comparison.4. Aquarium Fence.Photos of another fence that was designed to impress were posted toFacebookin July 2013 by Mehmet Ali Gökçeo?lu of Turkey. Described as a “successful businessman” and engineer, Mehmet must be doing well financially. Replacing 164 meters of boring steel fence with an aquarium full of fish, eels, octopus and Aegean Sea water doesn’t come cheap. However, it’s worth it. Gökçeo?lu reportedly enjoys watching the crowds who visit his aqua-fence as much astheyenjoy watching the sea creatures.5. Lock Fence.Fastening a padlock to a fence and throwing away the key has become, for today's couples, a popular way of demonstrating undying love. This trend was transformed from a cute dramatic gesture into something more over the top in June 2014 on Paris’s Pont des Arts. The weight of thousands of locks caused a 6.5-foot section of the bridge’s fencing to collapse. Apparently the accident did not cause any physical injuries, just a few broken hearts.6. Bra Fence.InNew Zealand, attaching large collections of everyday objects to fences is something of a national obsession. Teapot, shoe, rubber boot and toilet fences appeal to various connoisseurs but the jewel in the Kiwi crown is the bra fence in Cardrona. Since 1999, hundreds of brassieres have mysteriously appeared on a stretch of wire farm fencing, attracting floods of tourists to the area.7. Ballpark Fences.Back in the good old US of A, perhaps the most iconic fences are the ones that surround baseball fields. Take, for example, Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox and the oldest park in major league baseball, at just over a century. Fenway is famous for its exceptionally short 302-foot right field fence, which gives batters an advantage and has led to its reputation as a “hitters’ ballpark.” But from the spectators’ point of view, the right field boundary at AT&T Park in California has more to offer. Giants’ fans can catch the game from aboard a boat on McCovey Cove, just the other side of theSan Francisco fence.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/7-famous-fences-around-the-worldNo email address was supplied by.

Central and didn't get it.
The Royals did their part at U.S. Cellular Field, beating the Chicago White Sox 6-4 to win the four-g...<COL>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- When Washington Nationals starter Jordan Zimmermann headed to the bullpen to warm up for his start Sunday, bullpen coach Matt LeCroy did not notice anything different about the mild-mannered right-hander from tiny Auburndale, Wisc."He warmed up the way he normally warms up," former Washington catcher LeCroy said.That was comforting news for the Nationals since the veteran had bruised his shoulder when he was hit by a line drive off the bat of Casey McGehee in his last start on Sept. 20 at Miami.Zimmerman, 28, given three extra days of rest due to the bruise, turned in a dazzling tuneup for his postseason start as he threw the first no-hitter in franchise history.The National League East champion Nationals beat the Miami Marlins 1-0 before a roaring home crowd of 35,085 on the last day of the regular-season in a game that took just 121 minutes."I think in the fifth and I looked up and saw zeroes on the board," Zimmermann said. "They were swinging early and it was the last game. I figured I would be around (80 pitches) and come out. The best way of staying in is not giving up any hits I guess."Zimmermann retired center fielder Christian Yelich for the final out of the game on a diving catch in left-center field by rookie Stephen Souza, Jr.What did Zimmermann think when Yelich smoked the liner to left?"Double. No doubt double. I will buy (Souza) anything," Zimmermann said with a grin. "He saved me."Nationals (96-66) ended the year a season-best 30 games over .500 and were 19-8 in the month of September. The Marlins (77-85), who lost 100 games last year, failed in a bid to finish second in the division as they lost for the 13th time in 19 games to Washington this year."It's a special day," said Washington manager Matt Williams, whose team won its 51st home game. "This doesn't happen very often. What a perfect end for his season (and) a fantastic end to our (regular) season. It's the perfect baseball day -- 80 degrees and sunny."The Nationals ran onto the field to mob Zimmermann and the celebration continued in short left field after the final out."I was just running, because I thought it was going to be in the gap and then I kind of heard the crowd go crazy and that's when I knew, OK, that's bad news for the Fish right here. What are you going to do? He made a hell of a play," Yelich said.Souza, the Triple-A International League player of the year, had a rough day in left field in the second game of a doubleheader Friday night in a sloppy 15-7 loss but he is considered one of the best athletes in the system."I got a good jump on it," said Souza, who took over in left to start the inning as Williams wanted his best defense on the field. "I was holding on like a football (catch). I was going to put my body on the line.""An unbelievable play," said Washington catcher Wilson Ramos, who was behind the plate for all 27 outs. "I'm excited for this day."The losing pitcher was Henderson Alvarez (12-7), who threw a no-hitter on the last day of the season in 2013."Like I said, I had a vision of that, but Henderson doing it again, not against us," said Marlins manager Mike Redmond, on the day he was given a contract extension through 2017. "There's not a whole lot to say. He pitched great, we couldn't get anything going, and then the guy makes a great play out there in left."Said Alvarez, through a translator: "It's things of the game that just happen. From one year to another. It was just his day. It was an excellent day for him and something that God put in front of him for today to happen."Zimmermann (14-5) retired the first 14 batters before Justin Bour, the first baseman, drew a two-out walk in the fifth. Zimmermann then retired catcher J.T. Realmuto on a liner to short -- the third line drive out of the inning."Three rockets," said Zimmermann, who then began to think something special may be going on.While holding Miami hitless, Zimmermann had singles in the fifth and seventh. The right-hander fanned 10 batters with one walk and threw 104 pitches, 79 for strikes.With the playoffs looming, Zimmermann figured he might pitch about six innings since that is how long Stephen Strasburg went on Saturday. But Williams said there was no way he was going to take out Zimmermann until he gave up a hit.Washington shortstop Ian Desmond gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead in the second on his 24th homer of the year, a line drive into the Miami bullpen in left on a 90 mph pitch from Alvarez (12-7).Alvarez allowed 10 hits and the one run in seven innings before A.J. Ramos took over in the last of the eighth.No email address was supplied by.

Boston, LeBron James completed his stunning return by putting it back on Friday.
"It feels good, it feels right," he said. "I'...<COL>Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports/ReutersINDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- Four years after he tore off his Cavaliers jersey following a disappointing playoff loss at Boston, LeBron James completed his stunning return by putting it back on Friday."It feels good, it feels right," he said. "I'm happy to be back."James appeared publicly in his old No. 23 for the first time Friday at Cavaliers media day, an event that drew more than 300 media members and required a tent outside the facility to house them all. James was the main attraction, as always, and the new Big Three he has assembled with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving.But before James could return home, he first had to clear it with his young boys.James sat down with LeBron Jr. and Bryce to ask how they felt about moving back to Ohio."You get to play with Kyrie Irving?" they asked, which made James chuckle then and now. "We get to go back home to our house? Am I getting to go back to my old school and old friends?"When James answered yes to all of their questions, both boys gave their blessing. Soon, James was on his way.He returns far different than the man who left four years ago. He has two championships now, a pair of Finals MVP trophies and a mindset dedicated toward winning.James didn't know how to win when he left the Cavs. He does now. And while he no longer has to prove to anyone he is a champion, now he is faced with ending a 50-year title drought in his homeland."I ask more of myself than anybody could ever ask of me," James said. "But I understand. I understand what it takes to win a championship, and I understand it's the hardest thing that you can ever do in your basketball career is to try to win a championship."I've been two up and two down in four years. So I wept from crying tears of joy and tears of frustration. I know it all. I know what it takes."He will be expected to teach a cast of teammates who do not. Although the Cavs brought in past champions like Mike Miller, James Jones and Shawn Marion, the core group of Irving, Love, Tristan Thompson and Dion Waiters have never even appeared in a playoff game."I'm looking forward to learning every day," Irving said. "Every single day having the target on your back. The past three years, I've been chasing most of these guys on their respective teams ... It's definitely a surreal experience."James returns even leaner than when he left. And despite rampant speculation about why he shed more than 10 pounds this summer, he said it was nothing more than a challenge he issued to himself.Last year, he eliminated candy. This year, he went a step further and limited his diet to meat, fish, fruit and vegetables for more than two months."I'm 29 years old and I can still fly above the rim," James said. "I don't need to lose weight to do that. Not at this point of my career. It had nothing to do with basketball, but it did make me quicker, so that helps our team."Friday's event drew media outlets from Canada, Japan, Poland and Brazil, among others."I couldn't find a parking place," Cavs coach David Blatt joked.He has plenty of reasons to be smiling these days. He is the first coach to move directly from the Euroleague into an NBA head coaching position. Within days of accepting the job in Cleveland, Blatt learned James was coming, too.Now the expectations on this franchise are vast, but Blatt wants the players to embrace them. Thus far, it seems they are."I know a lot of people want to say championship or bust," Love said. "That's going to be a good mentality to have because we want the pressure. We want people to look at us as one of the best teams because we're going to have to hold ourselves accountable for everything that we do and our actions on and off the floor."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Mark Begich and his challenger, Dan Sullivan, the state’s former natural resources commissioner.In the second hour, Rep. Don Young and his challenger, Forrest Dunbar, took the stage.Fewer than a hundred people attended the debate, but organizers said thousands more watched as it was streamed online and on the radio.During the debate, Begich asked Sullivan why he hadn’t “said a word about the Koch brothers leaving dirty water” in the state. Sullivan did not respond.Sullivan told Begich he should not have voted to confirm Sally Jewell as Interior Secretary until she promised a road linking King Cove with an airport in Cold Bay. Begich said other members of the Alaska delegation also voted to confirm Jewell.On at least two occasions during the second hour of the debate, Young pointedly mentioned Dunbar’s youth. Dunbar said he recently celebrated his 30th birthday. Young is 81.Young also chastised Dunbar for “attacking” a congressman who has served the state for 42 years.“Don’t attack people,” Young said. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”Dunbar told Young he had embarrassed Alaskans several times this year, citing two separate video clips in which Young twisted a junior staff member’s arm and when he made faces on the House floor during a colleague’s speech.Young said, as a veteran, he doesn’t like when people touch him unexpectedly, which is why he reacted to the young staffer.“If I embarrassed you, I apologize,” he said. “I am who I am.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Beans, Pure MattersResearch shows a healthy lifestyle can cut your lifetime risk of cancer--and raise your odds of surviving if you get it. Obesity, lack of physical activity, and poor nutrition cause about one in three cancer deaths. Only tobacco causes more.Here are some things you can do to reduce your cancer risk:The relation between the foods you eat and cancer risk is complex. A lot of questions must still be answered. But there is strong evidence that those who eat a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant sources have less chance of contracting some of the most common cancers.The American Cancer Society (ACS) suggests you focus on getting at least five daily servings of a variety of fruit and vegetables and eating whole grains. For protein, choose fish, poultry, or beans rather than red and processed meats. Opt for smaller portions, particularly of meats and other high-calorie foods.Adults should do at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at least five days a week, the ACS says. To reduce colon and breast cancer risk, 45 to 60 minutes is better. Exercise also helps you stay at a healthy weight. That reduces your risk of cancers tied to obesity.Being overweight or obese plays a role in 14 to 20 percent of all cancer-related deaths, the ACS says. That includes cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, and kidney.It may come as no surprise that smoking causes 87 percent of all lung cancer deaths. But smoking ups your risk for at least 14 other types of cancer, too, including throat, stomach, and kidney cancer.When 11 of the 18 major cancers are found early, their five-year survival rates range from 90 to 100 percent. Survival plummets for more advanced cancer.Mammography, for instance, is an important tool for detecting breast cancer early on, when it's easiest to treat. But the benefits and limitations of mammography vary based on factors like age and personal risk. Experts have different recommendations for mammography. Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every two years for women ages 50 to 74. The ACS recommends yearly screening for all women ages 40 and older. Women should talk with their doctors about their personal risk factors before making a decision about when to start getting mammograms or how often they should get them.Cover up, use lots of sunscreen, and make sure your family avoids bad sunburns, especially while young. Too much exposure to ultraviolet rays causes more than a million cases of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year. and doctors expect to find nearly 70,000 cases of more serious melanoma in 2009.The culprits may include cancer-linked chemicals on the job and in the home. A lot of contact with secondhand tobacco smoke, pesticides, and dioxins might raise your risk, for example. Ask your employer about materials you handle. Test your home for radon. Read the labels of household products.On the whole, most authorities suggest a well-rounded diet rather than supplements. In fact, two of three studies of one supplement, the antioxidant beta-carotene, concluded that high doses actually increased smokers' lung cancer risk.You should enjoy:Limit your intake of:Breast cancer patients may go weeks without seeing a doctor.

Mark Begich, Libertarian candidate Mark Fish, and Independent candidate Ted Gianoutsos shared their views on topics ranging from how to deal with the terrorist group ISIS to the amount of political ads being put out to affordable health care.The forum which also included taped remarks from gubernatorial candidates Bill Walker and Sean Parnell was hosted by ASD student leaders.Two of the moderators say the event matters because it gives young adults a chance to get involved in politics early in life. And by hearing the candidates thoughts in person, the next generation can learn how to make informed decisions before they become voters."A lot of times politics can seem part of an adult world or on a screen or can seem very distant and when you see these flesh and blood people and they are talking and they stumble and they have arguments and they have their own quirks, it makes it really interesting, it makes it engaging and it really makes us care about our politics and see that it really does affect us," said West High junior Barae Hirsch who is part of Youth Vote 2014."Candidates provide you with information and even though they are trying to sway you to your vote, still listening to them and listening to the information that they give you allows you and gives you an ability to make your own decision," said West High junior Allison Haynes, who is part of the Youth Vote 2014.Republican Senate candidate Dan Sullivan was not in attendance. The forum says he declined the invitation.The series of events which will also include a candidate meet and greet, youth roundtable discussions, and a youth mock election is being sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Anchorage.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Here's another recipe for bell peppers.  They hold a meatless blend of herbed rice with pine nuts and currants.  Offer one for a main-course serving, or use smaller bell peppers and serve as an accompaniment to grilled meat or fish.  The rice filling can be served on its own as an unusual side dish.2 tablespoons olive oil1 cup coarsely chopped onion¼ cup pine nuts2 cups long-grain white riceOne 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes, with purèe¼ cup dried currants3 tablespoons minced fresh minttablespoons minced fresh dill or 1 teaspoon dried dill½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper, or to taste½ teaspoon salt, or to taste½ teaspoon ground allspice4 large green or red bell peppersHeat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and pine nuts; stir until the onions are translucent, about 8 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low; add the rice and stir until it is lightly coated with oil.  Stir in the tomatoes with purèe, currants, mint, dill, pepper, salt, and allspice.  Cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.While the rice mixture is cooking, preheat the oven to 350° F.  Oil a 13X9X2-inch glass baking dish.  Cut 1 inch off the stem end of each pepper; reserve for caps.  Remove the seeds.When the rice is tender, taste and adjust the seasoning.  Fill each pepper with about 1 cup of the rice; top with the reserved caps.  Place the peppers in the prepared dish.  Oil a large piece of foil; cover the dish with the foil.Bake for about 50 minutes or until the peppers are tender.Advance preparationThe rice mixture can be cooked up to 2 days in advance; cover and refrigerate.  Bring the rice to room temperature, stuff the bell peppers, and bake just before serving.Paulette Mitchell, a culinary instructor, television personality, spokesperson, freelance food writer, and the award-winning author of 13 cookbooks, is known internationally for her quick-to-prepare recipes with gourmet flair.

Mark Begich is running for re-election and his Republican challenger is Dan Sullivan.But Mark Fish and Ted Gianoutsos are also vying for the seat.Gianoutsos is “running only to open ANWR, and fill our pipeline,” he said. “But most importantly to do it in the best and the most beneficial way for America, Alaska and wildlife.”In the past decade, Gianoutsos has run for public office five times—three times for the U.S. Senate, once for the House of Representatives and once for governor.Each time, he said, it was to push for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling.Gianoutsos voted in his first election in 1960.“I cast my first vote in November for John F. Kennedy for president,” Gianoutsos said. “He said in his inaugural speech: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.’ That inspired me for everything I've done for the rest of my life.”He said he would bow out of the race if Sullivan or Begich publicly committed to opening ANWR.“If Dan stands up and he says that, I will withdraw, and I will do all I can to elect Dan,” Gianoutsos said. “If Mark says that, it’s still open for Mark. This question of ANWR, which is worth two trillion dollars, dwarfs anything they possibly could do for Alaska.”Fish is running as a Libertarian and says he will not vote for either Begich or Sullivan.“I don’t see the ideas that (Dan Sullivan) is pushing are any more relevant to individual Alaskans than what Mark Begich has, and that’s why I’m doing this,” Fish said. “What the Libertarian Party wants to do, and what I want to do is just to be there as an alternative, so people have a place to go to, and they're not left in a total state of anarchy. I do feel one day this two-party system is going to collapse.”Fish wants marijuana completely legalized in Alaska, but opposes the measure to raise the minimum wage.“Minimum wage hurts the youngest and poorest workers,” he said. “It's simple free market economics. When you have a group of people that are artificially paid a higher wage than what the market bears, there are going to be less of them hired.”Fish has run for Anchorage Assembly and a state House seat. He runs mostly out of principle, he said.“I'm kind of reminded of that old adage from Marlon Brando's quote in The Wild Bunches, when he's asked what he's rebelling against and he says, ‘What you got?’”It’s a long shot that either Fish or Gianoutsos would win the Senate race, so we asked: do you really think you could win?“To win, literally, would take a miracle,” Gianoutsos said. “It’s not impossible, because as you know, with the internet, all of a sudden, my campaign could become viral in the next two or three weeks. I could easily go from 2 percent (in the polls) to 10 or 15 or 20 percent.”Fish admitted the chances are slim.“I don't think there's a probability I'll win, but there's always a possibility,” Fish said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

At the time, Anchorage biologist Jessy Coltrane with the state Department of Fish and Game estimated that one or two moose were killed by the fences annually, with locations such as the Atwood Manor and Estate and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson seeing multiple moose deaths.Prior to Tuesday’s vote Coltrane testified that palisade fences still kill local moose, when they try to step over the fences’ edges and become impaled on the upward-facing spikes.Those opposed to the ban told the Assembly that it constituted too much government interference, noting that many more moose are killed each year by cars on local roads -- a point Johnston agreed with in July.The new ordinance only affects new construction, and existing fences would be allowed to stand.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Mark Begich slightly behind in efforts to keep his seat against a strong challenge from a well-funded Republican opponent, capping one of the nation’s most expensive Senate races.<COL>Republican challenger Dan Sullivan held a more than 5 percent lead on incumbent Alaska Sen. Mark Begich Tuesday night with half of percent of precincts reporting.In the most expensive political battle in Alaska history, and a race that held the potential to swing the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, Sullivan had jumped to a 78,126-69,537 advantage as of 10:15 p.m. and 55 percent of precincts reporting.Libertarian Mark Fish held less than 4 percent of the vote, with Ted Gianoutsos garnering 2 percent.Sullivan, speaking at his election watch party Tuesday night, said he hoped his message had translated to rural Alaska during the campaign."I don't want to know what the polls say," Sullivan said. "l told supporters that we ran a campaign that they can be proud of."Asked about the returns Tuesday, Begich was resolute."It's going to be a long night," Begich said. "It might be a long week."From the beginning, the campaign battles between Begich and Dan Sullivan, the state’s former attorney general and Department of Natural Resources commissioner, had formed up as a contest between one of the state’s few prominent Democrats -- a former Anchorage mayor who narrowly defeated Sen. Ted Stevens after a later-dismissed 2008 corruption conviction -- and a challenger asserting that both of Alaska’s Senate seats should once again be in the GOP fold.At several debates, includingone hosted by Channel 2 last week,Sullivan sought to link Begich’s record to those of prominent Democratic leaders, including President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Sullivan also ran on his record, taking credit for restoring pension funds during his tenure as attorney general inan ad sharply questioned by union groups.In response, Begich targeted the authenticity of Sullivan’s Alaska roots given his background in Maryland, taking up an attack line dating back to a GOP Senate primary debate -- at which Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell saidhe had a jar of mayonnaise that had been in Alaska longerthan Sullivan. Begich also aired TV ads emphasizing the closeness of his voting record to Alaska’s senior senator, Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- but drewa cease-and-desist letter from her office,beforeshe endorsed Sullivan at a Monday rally headlined by Mitt Romneyin Anchorage.Tuesday’s votes took place against a national backdrop whichsaw the GOP pick up control of the Senatealong with formerly Democratic Senate seats in six states -- Iowa, Colorado, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia and North Carolina. That math made Alaska’s race -- previously one of the nation’s highest-profile Senate seats in play, contributing to some $50 million in political spending during the campaign -- redundant to the GOP’s greater aims Tuesday, but no less important to Alaskans.Tuesday's results might not be the final answer on the election, withthe state Division of Elections receiving more than 50,000 early and absentee ballotsbefore polls closed at 8 p.m.Channel 2's Corey Allen-Young and Austin Baird contributed information to this story.This is a developing story.

Sean Parnell and challenger Bill Walker is separated by about 1 percentage point.Just after 11:55 p.m., with 94% of the precincts reporting, Independent candidate Walker has received 47 percent of the vote, compared to Gov. Parnell’s 46 percent.Governor Sean Parnell originally came into office on July 26, 2009, replacing then Governor Sarah Palin, who resigned halfway through her term.  Parnell would become the tenth governor of Alaska, running for re-election in 2010.During Parnell’s 2010 campaign, he faced off against Bill Walker in the primary and defeated former House Majority Leader Ethan Berkowitz in the general election.After finishing second to Parnell in the 2010 gubernatorial primary election, Walker decided to try his luck again, announcing his intentions to run again in 2014, only this time, deciding to run as an independent.Originally the race for governor, a three-way race between Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, Democrat Byron Mallott and Walker, wasn’t expected to be close. Pundits figured Mallott and Walker would split the vote, ensuring a Parnell re-election.All that changed days after the primary.Walker had originally teamed up with Craig Fleener, a former Deputy Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as his Lieutenant Governor running mate.  Following the August primary election, Walker announced that Byron Mallott, the Democratic Party nominee for governor would be replacing Fleener, creating the so-called Walker-Mallott unity ticket.Shifting party lines to unseat Parnell, a move that would turn Alaska’s gubernatorial race into a contest that has been very close throughout the fall.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Sean Parnell trailed independent Bill Walker while Democratic Sen. Mark Begich appeared headed for defeat as the GOP seized control of the U.S. Senate. A much-debated effort to legalize marijuana, meantime, looked poised for victory.The Division of Election had counted all precincts by 1:30 a.m. Monday. While tens of thousands of absentee, early and questioned remained to be counted, the preliminary results showBill Walker and Byron Mallott’s Independent/Democratic “unity ticket” narrowly aheadof Gov. Sean Parnell and Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan. Walker/Mallott held 48 percent of the vote versus Parnell/Sullivan’s 47 percent.The gap was 3,165 votes as candidates and supporters retreated to their homes and after-parties.Democrat Byron Mallott, Walker's running mate, missed the Election Night gathering in Anchorage late Tuesday because lightning struck his flight out of Southeast Alaska, his son told KTUU.Ben Mallott said the candidate was on a flight from Juneau that was forced to stop in Sitka.Parnell, addressing supporters at the Anchorage Hilton Tuesday, pointed out that his ticket's showing had improved from a 2 percent gap behind Walker/Mallott earlier in the evening, but said more work remained."We have a long way to go," Parnell said.Two of three seats in Alaska’s congressional delegation were on the ballot, withRepublican challenger Dan Sullivan leading Begich49-45percent. Libertarian Mark Fish had fewer than 4 percent of the vote, while Ted Gianoutsos had garnered 2 percent.See precinct-by-precinct results below, with areas won by Begich in blue and Sullivan strongholds in red.Begich was not conceding late Tuesday night as his campaign noted that some rural Alaska votes have not yet been tallied."From Southeast Alaska to the North Slope, every Alaskan deserves to have their vote counted," his campaign wrote in a statement. "Senator Begich is proud to have run the most extensive campaign in rural Alaska's history and to have stood for the rights of Alaska Natives and rural Alaska."Sullivan's spokespeople said candidate would not make a speech until a news organization "called" the race, and declared him the winner. His supporters waited until aftermidnightfor the candidate to address them.When Sullivan finally took the stage at Election Central downtown, the crowd roared."This election has been about the direction of the country," said Sullivan flanked by his wife and three daughters. "I think so many Alaskans--Democrats, Republicans, independents, undeclareds were worried, are worried about the future, about our kids' future.""Hallelujah!" shouted a man in the crowd. "Not any more," a woman yelled."What started tonight is that, and again we're still going to be respectful of the process here," Sullivan continued. "But again, the ADN is saying it's looking like an insurmountable lead. But more importantly, throughout the country, starting tonight we are taking back our country. We're retiring Harry Reid, and we're going to take back America, the land that we love!"Rep. Don Young, Alaska's lone Congressman, walloped Democratic challenger Forrest Dunbar meantime with 52-40 lead. Libertarian Jim McDermott was pulling down 8 percent of the vote.Dunbar, 30, didn't immediately concede Tuesday night and delivered a message to his supporters: "Hold onto your yard signs.""If I were in Young's seat, I would certainly expect to win tonight," Dunbar said.In Anchorage,many closely watched Legislature races were skewing Republican,with GOP Rep. Mia Costello apparently successful in her bid to claim Democrat Sen. Hollis French’s vacated West Anchorage seat and Anand Dubey leading Matt Claman in an effort to fill an open seat left behind by Democrat-turned-Republican Lindsey Holmes.Voters weregenerally favorable to statewide ballot initiatives Tuesday,with Ballot Measure 2’s proposed legalization of marijuana passing with 52 percent of votes in favor to 48 percent opposed. Ballot Measure 3, which would raise the state’s minimum wage by about $2 an hour by 2016, was passing with 67 percent of votes in favor versus 31 percent of voters saying no, and Ballot Measure 4’s move to require legislative approval of large-scale Bristol Bay mining had about 65 percent of yes votes to 35 percent opposed.In an Anchorage vote appearing on state ballots at local precincts, residents rejected Mayor Dan Sullivan’s labor law AO37. The measure asking whether Sullivan’s move to restrict city unions’ power should remain law was failing, with 54 percent of voters saying no to nearly 46 percent of voters saying yes.Fourteen state judges were also up for retention votes to keep their seats for an additional 10 years. Almost all appeared on track for retention with at least 60 percent of the vote, with Palmer District Court Judge William Estelle --a recommended "no" vote for retention by the Alaska Judicial Councilafter billing improprieties -- at 54 percent of yes votes.Channel 2'sCorey Allen-Young, Grace Jang,Austin Baird, Dan Carpenter, Kyle Hopkins and Adam Pinsker contributed information to this story.VisitKTUU.com’s special elections sectionfor full coverage of Tuesday’s races, including a precinct-by-precinct voting map.

Thankfully the VFD were quick in getting set up." -- Ida LincolnUsing water pumped from the frozen Fish River, volunteer firefighters and good Samaritans in theSeward Peninsula village of White Mountainspent 10 hours Tuesday battling a house fire that gutted a two-bedroom home.The small, volunteer fire department learned of the blaze near the city community hall at about 7:15 p.m., said fire chief Jack Adams. Adams, who also teaches math and science at the village school, said only one person lived in the home.The occupant was surprised to feel the flames at his back as the house began to burn but escaped without serious injuries, Adams said.The cause of the fire was unknown Wednesday. Only about 10 people regularly attend volunteer fire department meetings, Adams said, but another 10 villagers pitched in to stop the blaze. Temperatures dipped to 0 below, freezing nozzles on fire hoses that workers then thawed in nearby sinks.White Mountain is a hunting and fishing village of about 200 people, 63 miles east of Nome, and one of the final stops of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.No email address was supplied by.

It's a rite of passage the boy will remember for the rest of his life.But if he plans to live a long and healthy life, he may want to chow down on a carrot stick or two while bonding with his buddies.Take a look at the recommendations for what men should be eating for optimal nutrition and to help prevent some of the diseases common to them.Men are generally larger and have a higher muscle to fat ratio than women. As a result, they also have higher protein and calorie requirements.Extra muscle gives men higher fat-burning abilities. But if high-fat foods are your fuel of choice, over time the belts in your closet will start to shrink.And so will your arteries.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your expanding waistline increases your risk for heart disease -- the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States -- and a host of other illnesses, including stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer."Eat healthy before you go to the party so you won't be as likely to overindulge," it advises. If you're hosting people for any game, the guidelines suggest that while it's OK to offer the traditional pizza, wings and chips, you should also add some healthy snacks to the menu, including vegetables and carrot sticks.Because men weigh more than women, they also require more protein.The recommended daily allowance for protein for the average man is about 52 grams per day. That's roughly the equivalent of about 8 ounces of meat. Protein requirements increase if you're an athlete or are physically active.Here's the formula for determining your personal protein requirements. For every pound of your ideal body weight, you will need 0.36 grams of protein. The key here is the word ideal. If you're overweight, the extra pounds should not be factored into the equation.Doctors also caution against eating too much protein since low-carbohydrate/high protein diets may cause kidney problems through a process called ketosis. Ketosis is said to increase insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease.Monounsaturated fats such as olive oil or omega-3 fatty acids offer health benefits to both men and women. But studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a vegetable-based omega-3 found in canola and flaxseed oils, may increase the risk of prostate cancer, the third most common cause of death from cancer in men.ALA has also been found, however, to be good for the heart. For men with risk factors for heart problems the benefits of ALA may outweigh the risks. But those with risk factors for prostate cancer should get their omega-3 fatty acids from fish and vegetable fats from olive oil, according to the American Cancer Society.Studies have also linked eating large amounts of red meats or dairy products to an increased risk of prostate cancer.The Cancer Society says men need to eat five or more servings of a wide variety of vegetables and fruits each day, limit intake of red meats and dairy products, and maintain an active lifestyle and healthy weight.Although statistics show that about 80 percent of those suffering from osteoporosis are women, men are not completely immune from the disease.A high-calcium diet is a woman's primary protection against osteoporosis, but a high consumption of calcium from food or supplements in men -- more than 2,000 mg. per day -- has been linked to an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.Studies suggest that about 800 mg. of calcium per day will protect men from osteoporosis without increasing the risk of prostate cancer associated with high calcium consumption. A cup of milk, for example, contains about 315 mg. of calcium.Although there are some differences when it comes to the dietary needs of men and women, there's one common theme for both sexes, regardless of age, fitness or health: When in doubt, check with your doctor to find what's right for you.Copyright 2014,Internet Broadcasting.

A splash of rum ...<COL>Sun, sand and sea is a delicious recipe by its very nature. Add a plate of ackee and saltfish, a traditional Jamaican dish of the creamy, savory ackee fruit and rehydrated dried fish, and you're well on the way to concocting paradise.A splash of rum won't hurt to add to the mix either. Or, for the braver souls, a generous shot of the liquor in a Red Stripe beer for a local fisherman's drink called a "steel bottom."For the rum drinker's benefit, Jamaican side dishes can often be starch-heavy: There's roasted or fried breadfruit, plantains, sweet potatoes and yams to accompany hearty oxtail stews, jerk-spiced meats and curry goat, with staples like the leafy green callaloo, coconut rice and field peas rounding out the mix.Island eating means seafood, and lots of it -- like the fiery pepper shrimp that Jamaican sisters Suzanne and Michelle Rousseau cook up in their new cookbook, "Caribbean Potluck.""Pepper 'swims,' or shrimp seasoned with chili peppers, are sold by shrimp vendors on the roadside and at stoplights in various parts of the island," the Rousseaus write. "Served at room temperature out of little plastic bags, they make for a tasty, quick, 'smoke out of the ears' snack when journeying around Jamaica."Or, in this case, journeying to the dinner table.Spicy Garlic 'Pepper' Shrimp(Serves 4 to 6)Reprinted with permission by Kyle Books from "Caribbean Potluck" by Suzanne and Michelle Rousseau1 pound (16 or 20 count) fresh shrimp, in shells with heads on2 tablespoons sea salt2 cups vegetable oil1 Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped with seeds6 cloves garlic, diced¼ cup sliced scallions1 teaspoon sugar1. Butterfly the shrimp and remove the veins but leave the shells and heads on. Place in a bowl and rub the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of the salt; let sit for at least 30 minutes.2. Heat the oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. In batches, add the shrimp and deep-fry for 40 to 60 seconds, then quickly remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. When all the shrimp have been deep-fried, pour the oil out of the pan, leaving just 1 tablespoon.3. In small batches, quickly saute the Scotch bonnet, garlic, scallions, sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon sea salt over high heat for a few seconds. Add the shrimp in batches, give it a quick toss to coat with the seasoning and remove quickly from the pan; repeat until all the shrimp are finished. Serve immediately.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

Metro Line 2 also runs between Longyang Lu and the airport -- the journey takes about an hour.Maglev trains run once every 15 to 20 minutes and cost RMB50 ($8) for a single trip and RMB80 ($13) for a round-trip, good for seven days.Rooms with viewsNothing motivates you to get down to business like waking up to amazing views of the Shanghai skyline from a centrally located hotel.On a sunny, smog-free day the best Shanghai views can be found at the Park Hyatt.The 174-room hotel occupies the 79th to 93rd floors of the 492-meter-tall Shanghai World Financial Center -- the tallest functioning building in Shanghai.Rooms look down on the awe-inspiring high-rise matrix of Pudong.Over on the Bund, Waldorf Astoria Shanghai and The Peninsula Shanghai are top choices for straight-on views toward the skyscrapers of Lujiazui.If you'd rather enjoy views of both sides of the curved Huangpu River, you'll want to check into the Hyatt on the Bund on the north end, or Indigo Hotel on the south end.The latter also provides views of Shanghai Old Town.Park Hyatt Shanghai, 100 Shiji Dadao, near Dongtai Lu; +86 21 6888 1234; from RMB 1,800 ($293)Waldorf Astoria Shanghai, 2 Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu, near Guangdong Lu; 86 21 6322 9988; from RMB 2,500The Peninsula Shanghai, 32 Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu, near Beijing Dong Lu; +86 21 2327 2888; from RMB 2,700Hyatt on the Bund, 199 Huangpu Lu, near Wuchang Lu; + 86 21 6393 1234; from RMB1,120Hotel Indigo Shanghai On The Bund, No.585 Zhong Shan Dong Er Road; +86 21 3302 9999; from RMB 1,209Memorable mealsWhen it comes to dinner, Maison de L'hui on Julu Lu is the place to impress the pickiest of clients.No email address was supplied by.

Yet Malaria still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year.All it takes is a single mosquito bite and you can become infected. In 2012, the tropical disease caused 627,000 deaths internationally, 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Ashley Uys, a South African biotechnologist-turned-enterpreneur, is hoping to bring that number down to zero.Through his company, Medical Diagnostic, Uys has developed a self-testing kit that can diagnose the disease in less than 30 minutes, and put sufferers on the path to recovery faster."I decided to look at what is the most needing product in Africa at the moment. And malaria, malaria is big," says Uys."I then decided to look at a malaria test that can actually show you the strain of malaria you have -- the type of malaria -- so (doctors) know which treatment to give you, and then also to see if the treatment is working or not. So I developed a test that can do all of that."Merging science and businessThe best think about Uys' test is the price: they cost roughly 30 cents each, a fact Uys takes immense pride in."The fact that (they are affordable) of course makes it more accessible to the public. For me. it is very satisfying to know that a farm worker in a rural area doesn't have to worry about going to a doctor. Our product can be used at the point of care," he says."You don't need skilled labor to use it: prick (your finger), run the test and wait for results. There's a lot of diamonds in the rough (in Africa), a lot of potential, and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential. So it has a knock-on effect that is important."Given Uys is only 30 years old, he's achieved an incredible amount. Like many young entrepreneurs, he has drawn inspiration from his childhood and surroundings. Using this experience, Uys creates local solutions for everyday problems. For the Cape Town native, malaria prevention is just the beginning.Saying 'No' to drugsUys has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community: Drug use."On the Cape Flats, there was a big problem of drugs abuse," he recalls."People abusing methamphetamine, et cetera. Fortunately for me, although I grew up on the Cape Flats where it's very prevalent, I used sport to keep me away from bad habits and getting involved with the wrong crowd."Now, as the founder of his own biotech company, Uys created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs, including amphetamines, benzyls, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroine and morphine. The idea first came to him when, following a survey of users, he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement. Following this revelation, Uys had a light-bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level."We get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones. I thought to myself: 'imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus. The camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action, or (tell) if they're dilated or constricted."Uys is still working on the prototypes for his Oculus ID pupil scanner, but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks."I'm looking at innovation as the challenge for me. If you look at the first world countries it's satisfying for me to see that we are innovating on that level or even better."And me coming from Belhar, I didn't go to Harvard, didn't have a rich dad who could buy me what I wanted -- I had to work for everything. I had to work and study. I used to pack fish when I was a student. And that motivated me to work harder," he says.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

In fact,...<COL>There is growing likelihood that the November 24 deadline for a nuclear agreement with Iran may come and go without a comprehensive agreement. That reality carries a much broader message for America than just the absence of a deal with Iran.In fact, it's a poster child for a very inconvenient reality: We're stuck in a kind of Middle East Bermuda Triangle where messy outcomes are more likely than neat solutions and where ambiguity and uncertainty will rule over clarity and stability for years to come. Even should a deal with Iran be reached, this region is likely to remain the Muddle East for some time to come.And we better get used to it.Part of the problem, of course, is us. We sit thousands of miles away, in a protected cocoon with nonpredatory neighbors to our north and south and fish to our east and west -- what one historian brilliantly called our liquid assets. And while this physical detachment is a wondrous advantage, it has also given us a very skewed view of the world.We may have freed ourselves from the dark forces of history and geography. But the rest of the world hasn't. Just ask the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, Egyptians, Israelis or many others.For a start, our skewed view contributes to our naivete because we no longer really understand the mentality of the small power who lives in the bad neighborhood on the knife's edge. It also explains our arrogance, because we really don't have to listen. Our margin for error is very wide given our size, power and protected status, which helps explain our idealism and why we somehow believe we can and should find those solutions.Finally, our location informs our pragmatism, and the sense that somehow we can develop answers to these problems based on our own Hollywood, happy ending and heroic view of the world. I'm sure you remember "Mission Accomplished" under the last president -- and the campaign he launched to turn Iraq and Afghanistan into functioning democracies. Yet 11 years later, and we're now heading into Iraq War III.Even our current president believed that the Arab Spring required the United States to get on the right side of history by acquiescing in former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's downfall. But Egypt today is arguably less free and prosperous than under Mubarak. And let's not forget President Barack Obama's words about "ultimately defeating ISIS."Let's get real.Even though we killed Osama bin Laden and dismantled al Qaeda's central core, the gravest threat to our security right now isn't ISIS at all but an affiliate of an al Qaeda we were supposedly to have destroyed, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). These groups emerge from the poisonous environment that is now the Middle East. In order to defeat them permanently, we'd have to fix the entire region. We can't do that.And now we come to the inconvenient truth.The Middle East is a broken, angry, dysfunctional region (just make it BAD for short.) With the exception of Tunisia and perhaps Kurdistan -- both still works in progress -- and several of the Arab kings, the Arab world is melting down. It is now, and will be for a good deal longer, marked by civil war. It is dysfunctional, and it is made up of largely failed or failing states that lack good governance, respect for rule of law, gender equality, transparency, accountability and respect for freedom of conscience.Some argue that more time is required -- they urge us not to judge prematurely. Fair enough. But even the longer term trend lines don't look good.Where are the leaders who are capable and willing to rise above their narrow partisan, sectarian affiliations to govern in the interests of a nation as whole? Where are the institutions that reflect the popular will, inclusiveness and legitimacy of the public? And where is the good governance that seeks to deliver freedom, security and economic prosperity? Ultimately, where are the moderates within the Arab Muslim world who will denounce, fight and marginalize the extremists who have corrupted their religion?The politically incorrect read on all of this is that this part of the world just isn't ready for prime time. Indeed, there is not a single issue that appears on the verge of a sustainable solution. And there won't be for some time to come.Israeli-Palestinian peace? To do that, you need leaders, real ownership and decisions to close the yawning gaps on the big issues. But right now, there aren't any of those things in sufficient quantities.What about Iraq? That remains a country whose future is extremely uncertain as corruption, sectarianism, and regionalism threaten to pull it apart.Syria? Right now it is a veritable black hole with at least four subconflicts: ISIS vs. America; Bashar al-Assad vs. the so-called moderate Sunni opposition; jihadis vs. jihadis; and sooner rather than later, perhaps, America vs. al-Assad. What kind of Syria all of these tensions will produce is simply unknowable. Suffice it to say, a unified, democratic state where everyone lives in peace and harmony will likely not be one of them.The fact is that more progress has been made on the U.S.-Iranian nuclear issue than all of these other issues. And yet even here the politics on both sides, and the gap between what is demanded of it and what Iran wants, namely sanctions relief without giving up its desire to be a nuclear weapons threshold state, probably can't be bridged right now.America will have its hands full in this region for years to come. And it may well be able to help shape outcomes to some of these problems that will further its own interests. But it must give up any illusion that it can somehow produce solutions.These are, by and large, Middle Eastern problems, and their solutions will need to be owned by those who live in the neighborhood.Michael Jackson opined in his classic song "Man in the Mirror" that if you want to make a real change, than start by looking in the mirror. If the region wants to fix itself with America's help, that's the place to start.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Members of the Alaska Bureau of Investigation traveled to the community of 980 people, about 17 miles inland, east of Hooper Bay.Troopers labeled the death a homicide but have revealed no information about the investigation in the following weeks.Now, supporters of Roxanne Smart have launched a Facebook page,Justice for Roxanne Smart,where friends and family have posted memories of the teen. The page includes photos from a candlelight vigil held behind the Chevak Clinic and seeks to draw attention to the case from troopers and Alaska media.The organized push for information borrows techniques froma similar page set up after 22-year-old Michelle Lane’s Sept. 2 deathin Anchorage.“Roxanne did not deserve this,” organizers wrote on the page Saturday. “The person who did this to her needs to found and put away. If anyone has any information any suspicion we ask you to go to the cops.”Roxanne’s mother, Matilda Smart, says that she is satisfied with the pace of AST’s investigation, although she hasn’t heard much since it began.“We had a visit from the state troopers a few weeks ago, and he said they’re still investigating what happened,” Smart said.Trooper spokesperson Megan Peters says investigators working on the case had not responded to a list of Channel 2 questions forwarded to them as of Wednesday morning. Troopers have not answered, for example, whether authorities have determined the cause of Smart's death in an autopsy,Henry Smart, Roxanne's father, says a prosecutor told him about a month ago that an initial forensic analysis hadn't turned up anything. He says that during their last visit, troopers requested Roxanne's phone number and a copy of her phone bill."Last time that trooper came, he said they won't stop, they'll keep trying to find answers," Henry Smart said.Roxanne's mother credits family friends Jessica Ayuluk and Kerri Tall with creating the Justice for Roxanne Smart page. It was a good idea, she said.“I don’t Facebook myself,” Matilda Smart said. “I did not find out about the Facebook page until yesterday, when I was visiting one of my friends.”The mother says her family hopes the social media effort plays a role in bringing Roxanne’s killer before the law.“We really just want, want whoever did it -- I just really wish they’d give themselves up,” Matilda Smart said.The family remembers Roxanne as an outgoing young woman who loved fishing, as well as listening to music, taking walks and collecting bird eggs.“She was happy, and she was very helpful of anybody that was outside our house,” Matilda Smart said. “She was willing to go any which way and give them help.”Roxanne wasn’t known to be in a relationship at the time of her death, Matilda Smart said. Family members haven't been told when or where she was last seen alive.“All we know is that she was found behind the clinic,” Smart said. “That’s the last place we saw her.”Editor's note: An initial version of this story inaccurately named one of the Justice for Roxanne Smart Facebook page's creators as Katie Tall, not Kerri Tall.Channel 2's Corey Allen-Young contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Yes they were."I can hardly wait to see other Alaskan works of art," said retired teacher Sharon Strick,of Gakona, who shared the above four photos. "I know I'm not alone!Strick, 56, has worked in Bush schools from Akiak to Prince of Wales, but it wasn't until she visited nephews in Seattle that she realized she could use their Lego sharks and skiffs to teach herself to use the movie-making software and digital cameras.Strick has been working on stop-motion videos of Alaska-themed Lego scenes for years, including two short films titled "Trail Breakers" and "Oil Rig Terror," shared below.The long hours helped Strick take her mind off the death of her father, she said.  “When somebody passes away, you have to figure out to cope."Sitting in her yard, snapping pictures of Lego plumbs, made her smile. Now Strick,who learned that she is not alone in her love of Lego photography, is trying to return the favor.“If I can make somebody laugh, that may be all they need to get them through the day," she said.......Meantime, junior Alaska Lego builders are busy with Last Frontier creations of their own.

Police say rising heroin use in Alaska's largest city might be to blame.<COL>First, Dale Waymire’s $600 ice auger was stolen from behind his Airport Heights home. Then, someone broke into his wife’s car and stole her $300 pair of sunglasses, a gift from their daughter.“It’s real personal when you lose something, because they’re coming into your domain,” Waymire said. “They’re going through your stuff. What else have they gone through? That’s the bad part.”Waymire is an avid fisherman whose license plate reads “FISHUR.”“First thing, when I saw my auger missing, I thought, no more ice fishing,” Waymire said. “I got a nice big ice tent and everything for it.”In a way he was lucky; no one broke into his home.“Knock on wood,” he said.Across the alleyway his neighbor lost even more.“They went into her house,” Waymire said. “They got a bunch of stuff out of her house. A lot of cosmetic jewelry from her grandma, her mom. Some very memorable stuff. Stuff you can’t replace.”Airport Heights has seen what residents call a surge in break-ins and burglaries of vehicles, sheds and homes.Last month, thieves stole construction equipment from the site where the new Blood Bank is being built on Airport Heights near Debarr.“Certain streets like Sunrise has had a string of vehicle thefts,” said Rep. Gerran Tarr, who lives in the area. “Then this summer, Kinnickinnick had a string of thefts—both house thefts and vehicle thefts, and other items stolen from the backyard.”The community council in a Sept. 18 meeting passed a resolution urging the city to beef up police presence.Police say the uptick in crime is not unique to a certain neighborhood.Here are the numbers from the Anchorage Police Department:Thefts from cars and trucks went up 36 percent and shoplifting cases increased 23 percent in 2013 from 2012, according to numbers police released. Statistics from 2014 will be released next year.In 2013, the Airport Heights area reported 235 thefts; Bayshore-Klatt reported 192; Fairview reported 436 cases and the downtown area reported 555.Between January and July of this year, 5,462 theft cases were reported—down from 5,608 reported in 2013.Burglary cases, however, are up: 750 from January to July of this year, compared to 706 during the same period in 2013. Burglary is illegally entering property to steal something.Robbery cases, which involve force or the threat of force, are up, as well: 296 from January to July of this year, compared to 288 in 2013.Anchorage has also seen slightly more thefts from vehicles: 538 cases so far this year between January and July, compared to 531 in 2013.“What we're seeing is an increase in all of those types of cases here in anchorage but we're also seeing that nationally, as well,” said Jennifer Castro, an Anchorage Police Department spokesperson. “The prevalence of drug use, especially of heroin, could potentially be driving those numbers.”In 2013, Anchorage police seized 5.67 kilograms of heroin—up from 2.92 kg in 2012 and 2.78 in 2011. Methamphetamine use also appears to be increasing slightly. Police seized 5.95 pounds in 2013—up from 5.72 pounds in 2012 and 2.69 pounds in 2011.Police seized nearly 298 pounds of marijuana in 2013—up from 187 in 2012 and 158 in 2011.Seizures of crack cocaine and cocaine are down, however. Police seized 0.31 kilograms of crack in 2013—down from 0.90 kg in 2012 and 0.72 kg in 2011.Residents are encouraged to form Neighborhood Watch groups, but some Airport Heights residents said they have been waiting for up to two years for Neighborhood Watch signs.The program had been given grant money to pay for 50 signs, but that grant has expired, Castro said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Williams (neck), Jonathan Bostic (back) and Shea McClellin (hand) all missed the game, putting the spotlight on second-year linebacker Khaseem Greene, undrafted rookie Christian Jones and Darryl Sharpton, who has been a Bear since Sept. 24."There was a lot of change going on and unknown going on during the week with Lance and with D.J.," Trestman said. "D.J practiced, so that was a late addition. Phil (Emery, the general manager) was involved in helping us move some people around and get some people up. But it was simply just hard work and their preparation."I know there was a lot of extra time spent, (linebackers coach) Reggie (Herring) with the linebackers, up through Saturday and into Sunday to get them ready. Their meetings went very well, just talking to Reggie the times that they were in together at different times that were unrelated to the team being together. But just overall very, very good cooperation with everybody to get it done, and the guys who weren't playing were certainly helpful as well."Greene made a team-high eight tackles in his first start of the year and fifth start overall. Jones was in on four tackles in his first NFL start. Sharpton made five tackles, a quarterback hit and a pass deflection as he often blitzed. He's no stranger to starting, since he'd started 19 games for Houston from 2010-2013.Linebacker Willie Young now has a league-high seven sacks after recording two more against Atlanta."No. 1 he came in here and he was a projected starter before we got Jared (Allen), and when Jared came in he never flinched," Trestman said. "He really embraced the opportunity to play with Jared and learn from Jared and so his reps, because of the way we're moving people around, are not as much as they probably would have been when he initially got here."But he's been all about team. His energy is consistent each and every day. As you see him in the locker room he's got a smile on his face, he's alive and when he plays he plays all out and he's a charismatic guy who, I think, his play and his energy resonate throughout the defensive meeting room and on the field."Young also has patented his bass fishing celebration after sacks now, much like Allen has his rodeo lasso routine.Defensive back Demontre Hurst was another part of the defensive reserve corps that produced with others injured. The Bears had hoped to have Sherrick McManis available for the nickel coverage scheme after he recovered from a quad injury last week, but then he suffered a knee injury in practice.So Hurst played nickel and made his first career interception."He's a very smart player," Trestman said. "He had a very good training camp. He was always around the football. He does it in practice, as well. He had an opportunity yesterday and he made the most of it."Defensive tackle Stephen Paea has four sacks in a contract year, and there's one major reason he's having the impact he is in his fourth year."The best part I'm seeing right now is he's stayed healthy," Trestman said. "He's been able to play, and that's something he hasn't been able to do."Paea always seemed to be plagued by nagging types of injuries in the past, everything from turf toe to shoulder injuries and hamstrings."So we'll keep our fingers crossed that that continues because he's been a factor inside, he's been given some of the one-on-ones inside with other guys getting doubled, he's created some internal pressure which has been very good," Trestman said.Meanwhile, in an effort to reload, the Bears elevated cornerback Terrance Mitchell to the 53-man roster from the practice squad, waived linebacker Terrell Manning and signed safety Shamiel Gary and tight end Jacob Maxwell to the practice squad.Mitchell has been on the Bears practice squad all year after he was originally a seventh-round draftee by Dallas this year, out of Oregon. The Sacramento, Calif. native appeared in 40 games with 38 starts for Oregon, recording 144 tackles, seven interceptions -- including one returned for a touchdown -- four forced fumbles and 25 pass break-ups.Maxwell was first signed this year by the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent out of Louisiana-Lafayette. The 6-4, 240-pound Pearl River, La., native was with Miami for five weeks.Gary entered the NFL this season as an undrafted free agent with the New England Patriots out of Oklahoma State.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Here are three theories for the decline.<COL>As the long hours of summer sunlight disappear and the days grow shorter on the Kobuk River valley, a thundering rumble begins below the Brooks Range.The caribou are here. The return of the largest caribou herd in North America and a true Alaskan marvel in these lower valleys below Jade Mountain, the animals have fed families in the region for thousands of years. Recently, however, something has changed.The caribou are arriving at river crossings later and later each year, and the size of the herd is growing smaller and smaller, declining by almost half since 2003. Watch our three-part special report in the videos below and read on to learn why.3 theories on the declineThe Kobuk River Valley: At a Loss for Herds (part 1)For the last ten thousand years, Onion Portage has served as a main intersection for the caribou in their migration pattern as the animals travel each year cross the Kobuk River.National Park Service biologist Jim Lawler says the caribou’s total migration is about the size of Wyoming.“There’s few places in the world where there’s large natural landscapes like this, that allow migrations to go uninterrupted,” Lawler said.The migration happens twice a year in the Spring and Fall. During the summer the caribou are on the North Slope above the Brooks Range. As the temperatures drop they start to migrate south through passes in the range. The routes vary each year by year but one thing remains certain: The Kobuk must be crossed.When the caribou arrive at the the river they are more than halfway home to winter breeding grounds in the Koyuk drainage. Once in the water, the caribou waste no time. They move fast to the southern shore using their perfectly elongated and wide hooves as a makeshift paddle to move swiftly across.State and federal researchers have been watching and documenting this migration for decades. From 2010 to 2012, they found, the caribou have been crossing the Kobuk River later and later in the year and fewer have been going across.Steven Machida is the state’s regional supervisor for the Division of Wildlife in the Northern and Western part of Alaska. His crew tags caribou twice a year to document the migration and is seeing changes.“The last big population decline was in the 1970s," Machida said. “At that time the herd declined to approximately about 75,000. Since then it has grown steadily probably averaging about 15 percent per year until it reached it's peak in the mid 2000s at about a half a million caribou.”Since the mid-2000s the population has plummeted. In 2013 the herd is at just over 230,000 caribou.There are three main theories as to why the population is declining. First, it’s been well documented by the state and the Inupiaq natives that there is an abundance of predators and wolves within the migration pattern. Second, Lawler points to the lack of nutrition the Western Arctic caribou is getting during migration. A third issue is also at play, researchers said: Climate change.In the later months, the warmer weather has developed rain on snow which creates ice. This prevents the caribou from accessing their feed.Both the state and federal government admit the caribou population trend has always been cyclical. Sometimes the herd grows, sometimes it shrinks. But the dramatic change in the arctic sets raises questions about the future of the herd, and of the Kobuk River valley were families depend on the caribou for food.A hunter shares his caribouThe Kobuk River Valley: At a Loss for Herds (Part 2: Viewer Discretion is Advised)The Western Arctic caribou herd floods the lower valleys of the Brooks Range every Fall, ushering in another population surge. The Inupiaq who have lived off this land for more than 11,000 years traditionally hunt the animals. Villages along the Kobuk like Ambler and Kiana have easier access than others that live much further, but for years families across the region have made the trip.Dave Kelsey and his fiance’ Pauline Morris traveled 140 miles down river to get to Onion Portage to harvest the caribou they say no longer comes through their village of Noorvik.“Born to hunt, forced to work,” is one of Kelsey’s mottos. A testament to how important subsistence is to the Inupiaq and one that Inupiaq elder Walter Sampson says mirrors the feelings his people has about caribou.“Just imagine in the environment they grew up in and what they try to do to provide food for their family,” Sampson said. “If they couldn't catch any caribou that's part of the starvation.”Policymakers call this "subsistence" -- hunting and fishing to live.“'Subsistence' is really a term that someone from the western society came out with that term,” Sampson said. “To an Inupiaq, subsistence is a way of life.”In that life there are certain traditions that must be followed. An important part of the caribou hunt for the Inupiaq is providing for those who can’t hunt so no one starves in the village. Another tradition, still practiced today, is that a hunter does not eat his or her first caribou kill.“That's part of the tradition, no family starves in this region,” Sampson said. “If I should go out hunting I share my catch with whom I think doesn't have the resources to go out."History lessonsThe Kobuk River Valley: At a Loss for Herds (Part 3)Thousands of years ago, there no permanent villages along the Kobuk River. People in this region led a nomadic life.“These were family groups that lived with the seasons,” said Sampson, the Inupiaq elder. “By that I mean a family would move from camp to camp to camp.”Onion Portage was a popular destination for those camps. Caribou have long migrated to this one spot and the people have followed.“These small family groups over time started to gather,” Sampson said. “Every year they would get bigger and bigger. Over time they started to create a small tribal community.”Those were ancient beginnings that started villages like Ambler and Kobuk. It was the culture archaeologists like J. Louis Giddings began unearthing 11,000 years later. Michael Holt, who is the National Park Service archeologist, is an expert on the archaeological dig found by Giddings back in the 1940s. That effort discovered evidence that humans had been using the area for 10,000 years, leaving behind changing technology such as spears and, later, bows and arrows.“There's a deep culture connectedness to this place in Onion Portage and to the people who live around it and hunt nearby,” Holt said.No email address was supplied by.

"It's a great anthology of all of the stories you remember being creeped out by as a kid. ... I'm not supposed to spoil how we're going to do it (as a movie), but I think it's going to be ... very interesting and innovative."What August could reveal is that this won't exactly be kid-friendly."While this book is for children, the horror movie that we're making out of it I think hopefully captures how scary those books were when you were a kid but is not strictly a kids movie," he explained. "In fact, you should not take certain younger kids for this movie. I can't actually take the art into the house, because if my daughter saw it, we would have nightmares. We're aiming for a PG-13 -- the same way that I loved 'Poltergeist' and 'The Ring,' movies that aren't gory, but man they can freak the bejesus out of you."Deadline notes that August will be digging into the source material for his script, which as of yet doesn't have a director attached.Schwartz's tales were popular enough to spawn a trilogy -- soon after "Scary Stories" appeared in 1981, Schwartz delivered "More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" as well as "Scary Stories 3."All told, the "Scary Stories" series sold 7 million copies worldwide.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

Its course Tuesday prompted the Fairbanks North Star Borough to issue an evacuation watch order for about 50 homes from Mile 14 to Mile 32 of Chena Hot Springs Road.While the fire didn't get any closer to the road Wednesday, instead expanding to the east and west, residents along the road are still being told to be ready in case they must evacuate.Bernie Pineda, a spokesperson for the Alaska Fire Service, says about 105 people, along with nine each helicopters and fire engines, have been assigned to fight the Stewart Creek fire. Military CH-47 Chinook and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are also being prepared to conduct water drops on the fire, which is largely being fought from the air due to the possibility of ground crews encountering dormant bombs or other munitions on base.“The other 10 percent is outside of (Eielson) now, so it falls under the traditional jurisdiction to suppress the fire using traditional methods at this point, so we're using crews for that portion of it,” Pineda said. “There's no issue of walking into any unexploded ordnance at this point.”According to the federal Bureau of Land Management, another four fire crews -- a total of about 80 more firefighters -- arrived in Alaska from Oregon. BLM officials haven't decided whether all the reinforcements will fight the Stewart Creek fire, or if some will be sent to other wildfires burning in Alaska.Fire crews are also watching the 1,806-acre Skinny’s Road fire, which has restricted travel along the nearby Parks Highway after briefly closing it last week. Pilot cars are leading traffic through smoke along a 10-mile stretch of the highway, from Mile 322 to Mile 332, between 6 a.m. and midnight.“Travelers are reminded to use caution when driving through smoky conditions by driving with headlights on and watching for fire equipment and firefighters,” BLM officials with the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center wrote in a Wednesday update on conditions in the area.AICC officials say 103 wildfires are currently active statewide, 12 of which are staffed with firefighters. So far this year, 427 fires have burned about 920,000 acres of land.Channel 2’s Steve Mac Donald and Abby Hancock contributed information to this story.Contact Chris Klint(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Madole was struck multiple times in the back, troopers said."(Dick) didn't know how many times he fired his rifle,"a trooper sergeant wrote in the criminal complaint."(He) said he was angry, and he knew what he did was wrong."Dick has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder.Shortly after the shooting, Madole’s name wasadded to the Alaska Police Memorial in Anchorage. Former Alaska Department of Public Safety commissioner Walt Monegan said Madole, along with others honored, “aren't heroes so much in how they died, but in how they lived.” Madole was also remembered in April of this year at the Indian Country Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Artesia, N.M.Manokotak is a fishing village of about 500 people, 25 miles southwest of Dillingham in Southwest Alaska.No email address was supplied by.

In Anchorage, voters were asked to decide whether to keep a city law that sapped unions of negotiating power in an effort to lower city spending.Perhaps the most contentious initiative of the ballot measures is Ballot Measure 2, an initiative that would tax and regulate the production, sale and use of marijuana in Alaska. As of 11:32 p.m. Tuesday, supporters of legalizing marijuana are poised for victory, leading 109,835 votes to 100,530.As it stands, Alaska will join Colorado and Washington, two states that had previously legalized marijuana, as well as Oregon and Washington D.C., who also voted to legalize pot Tuesday.Both sides have fiercely debated the measure, with backers saying it would enrich the state’s coffers with tax revenue and opponents claiming law enforcement would face massive hidden costs in dealing with marijuana-related crimes.Ballot Measure 3, theinitiative to increase Alaska’s minimum wage, is easily passing with 68 percent to 31 percent of the vote.If the results hold, Alaska will have one of the highest minimum wages of any state by 2016. The measure would increase the state’s minimum wage from $7.75 per hour to $8.75 per hour beginning January 1, 2015.  On January 1, 2016, minimum wage would raise to $9.75 per hour from that point forward. While supporters say Alaska has traditionally had one of the nation’s highest minimum wages, economists warn that approving the measure would place additional costs on business owners.Ballot Measure 4, aimed squarely at the proposed Pebble Mine, is passing by a large margin of 65 percent to 34 percent. It would require the state Legislature to approve future large-scale metallic sulfide mines in the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve and find that any proposed mine would not endanger the BBFR fishery. The approval would be in addition to any other required permits or authorizations.Those in favor of the “Bristol Bay Forever” initiative call it an important step to protect fishing in the region -- although the Alaska Miners Association has vowed to fight it in court even if it’s passed.Anchorage voters are also deciding whether AO-37 --Mayor Dan Sullivan’s ordinance restrict city unions’ power-- should be kept on the books.With more than 94 percent of precincts reporting, the effort to repeal the law is closing in on victory with  53% of people voting to get rid of it compared to 46%.Unions have spent heavily to urge a no vote, while supporters of keeping the ordinance haveadopted copycat “Yes on 1” signs.Former Anchorage Assembly Chris Birch, a supporter of the city labor law championed by Sullivan, said unions advertising backfired.Birch labeled advertising that showed police cars on fliers and talking about a loss of public safety as "fear tactics.""When you scare people, that's what happens," he said.Gerard Asselin, an officer of the police union who worked on the seemingly successful effort to repeal the law, said his group was confident in the percentages they were seeing Tuesday night.A small number of elected officials created the law, he said. "What you are seeing with votes is reflective of what people want."Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

They surrender themselves to human traffickers waiting in cargo ships at sea, who then charge extortionate prices with the promise to smuggle passengers to Malaysia.At a little fishing port outside the provincial capital of Sittwe, carpenters building wooden boats explained how the system works."Fifty to 60 people fit into a boat like this," said Mahmud Yacoub, who squatted barefoot clutching a hammer in the skeleton of new wooden vessel about 20 feet long. "The travelers are mixed: men, women and children. It is dangerous and very expensive."Desperate to escapeThe United Nations estimates more than 100,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar this way since ethnic and sectarian violence erupted in the country's western Rakhine state in the summer of 2012. Hundreds died making the seaborne journey.The 2012 clashes between the state's Rakhine Buddhist community and Rohingya Muslims, a long-oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in this majority Buddhist country, left hundreds dead and more than 140,000 people homeless.More than two years after the violence, the government has forcibly segregated Rohingya from the rest of the population in Rakhine state. They live confined in enclaves -- rural ghettos, in effect -- from which they are not allowed to leave. In Sittwe, a town where Rohingya once lived side by side with Rakhines, it is now impossible to find a Rohingya walking down the street.One of the main mosques is still in ruins after it was torched in June 2012. Another mosque appears to be occupied by Myanmar police.Existence denied"Rohingya doesn't exist. Never exist!" repeated U Than Tun, a member of the Emergency Coordination Center in Sittwe, which overseas the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the state's poor and homeless population.He echoed the Myanmar government's official position, which denies recognition of the term "Rohingya." Instead, U Than Tun referred to Rohingya as "Bengalis," and described even those who have lived in Myanmar for generations as "illegal immigrants" from neighboring Bangladesh.It is part of a decades-old policy that has prevented Rohingya from being full citizens in Myanmar, leaving a million of them effectively stateless.Some community leaders in Sittwe want to take this policy of exclusion one dramatic step further."We want to expel the Bengalis from this land," said Than Tun, who is also a high school teacher in Sittwe.Buddhist fearsThe call for the expulsion of the Rakhine State's estimated 1.3 million Rohingya was echoed by a senior Buddhist monk at a monastery across town."It may be best if they are not here," said U Kaymasara.Several of his followers sat on the floor near his chair in deference as the monk explained his views. U Kaymasara claimed the Rohingya threaten to demographically overwhelm the state's Rakhine population."In one Muslim family there are 82 people," the monk claimed. "In Rakhine families, there are maximum three or four or five."According to government statistics, Rohingya make up only about one-third of the population in Rakhine state.U.N. officials warn the strict confinement of Rohingya to enclaves has destroyed their ability to rebuild their lives after the violence and arson of 2012."Lack of movement means people don't have access to their fields to go farming, don't have access to the sea to go fishing, don't have access to markets to trade," said Pierre Peron, spokesperson for the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar."The impact on freedom of movement is quite massive on hundreds of thousands of people."Threats to killNo email address was supplied by.

"While I was visiting, she picked me up from the airport, we dropped my suitcase off at her house, she was changing and noticed all her underwear was gone. We came back 30 minutes later and my suitcase was opened and all of mine were gone too! CREEP!"According to the Associated Press, fisherman Hannah Clark told Kodiak radio station KMXT that she began noticing items had been moved around in her home when she returned from fishing trips last summer. But she didn't connect those incidents to her missing underwear until she heard the news Wednesday.Clark says she can't believe "there's an actual underwear bandit."AST spokesperson Megan Peters didn’t have specifics on the case Wednesday morning, but reiterated the importance of taking steps such as concealing valuables and securing residences.“A lot of times burglaries are crimes of opportunity, but it’s best not to give people the opportunity,” Peters said.An email forwarded to Kodiak troopers asking several questions, including whether the locations showed signs of forced entry, exactly what was stolen, and the value of the items taken as well as any damages inflicted, wasn’t answered as of early Wednesday afternoon.Anyone with information on the burglaries is asked to call AST at 907-486-4121.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Five times that many people listen when he sings.A 16-year-old high school junior whose first language is Central Yup’ik, Nicholai is quickly gathering an online following for videos performing an old-school Alaskan art. Beginning in 2013, Nicholai began recording clips of his singing and drumming on an iPhone and posting the videos toa Facebook page he created called “I Sing. You Dance.”The title for the page comes from something he noticed while performing at Alaska Native dance festivals. Elders in the crowd would inevitably start nodding their heads to the beat. He sang, they danced.As of this week, the page had gathered more than 3,700 followers and a loyal, growing fan base for songs that Nicholai said he often makes up on the spot.“Yesterday I just posted a video, it said that, 'In Alaska, there are many different cultures, but me, I am Yup’ik,” Nicholai said in an after-school phone interview.'Let me take this drum and sing to all of you'In another clip, the teen said he is singing a simple verse about how people get around the village. “I said that, ‘A long time ago, they used to dog mush around here. A long time ago, they used to travel with kayaks.”'Long ago when they used to use dog sleds'Nicholai launched the page after posting a video of his singing on his personal Facebook account and finding friends and family loved the clip. “It turns out that my video got around 200 likes, and that wasn’t normal," he said.The I Sing You Dance page now has about two dozen videos. Some are serious, some are silly, like the one where he performs Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda" in high-pitched auto-tune.All share a look that's instantly familiar to anyone who has seen legions of singing and dancing teens serenading their webcams on YouTube: Wearing a backward ballcap and T-shirt, Nicholai mugs for the camera and introduces each song. The only-in-Alaska moment comes next as Nicholai places a drum he made at a Goodnews Bay dance festival to his face -- to give his voice an otherwordly echo -- and sings or chants in Yup’ik.Linguists say that of the 19 remaining Alaska languages,Central Yup’ik is the most commonly spokenand has the best chance of enduring because children are learning to speak it in some Western Alaska homes.“My parents always talk with their kids in Yup’ik, practically everybody in Toksook speaks Yup’ik, even the young ones,” said Nicholai, who is also a member of the Nelson Island high school dance group.Nicholai said he is thinking of recording his songs on a CD and plans to pursue a computer science degree in college. For now, the friendly comments he receives on his Facebook page have inspired him to keep making videos.“There’s all these feedbacks, these nice feedbacks, those are the ones that motivate me the most,” he said.Find KTUU digital director Kyle Hopkins attwitter.com/kylehopkinsakNo email address was supplied by.

Steve Remme said they haven't been able to create any snow since they made the first batch last week."The last time we saw this type of winter was 2000," Remme said. "We didn't get really good snow until mid December that year, but hopefully it'll be a little quicker than that."For people like Remme, downhill skiing is similar to other jobs that rely on the weather like farming and fishing."You're really dependent on the weather if it's not raining, your crop doesn't come in," Remme said. "If it (the snow) doesn't fall, the skiers don't come in."Remme said the ski area has opened by Thanksgiving for the past 14 years, but he's worried that may not be the case this time."This year we may not make it 'cause it's a little bit, everyday that goes by the window gets shorter," Remme said.The snow guns used to make snow is operational when temperatures drop to 25 degrees or below, but it's more efficient at subzero temperatures."When it's really cold you make a lot more snow, you have a lot higher production rate when it's down below in the teens," Remme said. "You get a lot more snow for what it's costing you to make the snow."While Remme hopes for more signs of winter, other businesses like SkiAK are also hoping for more snow.Rebecca Thurman, an employee of SkiAK said the shop has seen a steady flow of customers so far this season, but seeing a little more of the white stuff couldn't hurt."It's not our busiest time of the year yet, but still a lot of people coming in, trying on boots, checking out the skis and getting their purchases figured out," Thurman said.John Osowski, was prepping his skis for the season at the ski shop and said he was getting it done early so he can participate on the Hilltop ski team."I'm kind of anxious for it to snow," Osowski said.Kimberly Hoeppner, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service said it's not looking promising for snow over the next few days."Next week, possibly Monday night into Tuesday," Hoeppner said. "However chances are going to be limited as we do have high pressure that is going to be dominating the weather."It may not be what winter outdoor enthusiasts wanted to hear, but Thurman said there is one thing people might do in the meantime. "Do your snow dance every night before bed and yeah be patient it'll come," Thurman said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

But it may not be quite as cool as it seems.<COL>It's like the new "It Girl" work perk: Take as much time off as you want, as long as you get your job done.But it may not be quite as cool as it seems.Pioneered by tech start-ups and other small, niche businesses, these so-called "unlimited" vacation policies are now being tried out by a few bigger fish. Tribune Publishing, which owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, is the latest company to switch from giving employees a set number of days off to "discretionary time off."The idea: Treat salaried employees as "responsible, trustworthy adults" who know what's expected of them and who deliver results."The policy is intended to give [them] greater flexibility in taking paid time off and allow them to make appropriate work-life balance decisions for themselves," said a Tribune spokesman.Virgin Group founder Richard Branson put it more bluntly in a blog post where he unveiled a similar company policy: "If working nine to five no longer applies, then why should strict annual (vacation) policies?"Hard to argue with that.But it's too early to say how beneficial these new "discretionary time off" policies will actually be for employees.As it is, Americans only take three-quarters of their allotted time off, said Bruce Elliott, manager of compensation and benefits at the Society for Human Resource Management.One reason we shortchange ourselves: Some people worry they'll lose their job or miss out on a good raise or promotion if they use all their vacation days, especially when they have a bad boss or an employer that uses layoffs as a go-to management tool.So a take-all-you-want vacation policy may not mean you end up taking more time off than you used to. You might even end up taking less.Is that the goal of these new policies? Tribune says no. "Employees can use the same amount of time going forward as their annual vacation allotment — and even more, if needed," the company spokesman said.But both Virgin and Tribune make it clear that your performance better be up to snuff before requesting those days off."It's your responsibility to have an open discussion with your supervisor about your time off and its impact on your performance. As always, future career opportunities are assessed based on your performance and potential," Tribune's management wrote in a memo to employees published on JimRomenesko.com.Branson wants employees to take as much time as they want, but said he assumes "they are only going to do it when they feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business -- or, for that matter, their careers!" [Italics added.]Arguably, that is a lot of pressure to put on an employee who was just kind of hoping to spend a week at the beach. Especially since many of us already are given way more work than we can finish in a day -- and can't ever seem to catch up, said Cynthia Shapiro, a former HR executive who wrote "Corporate Confidential."While some companies may do a great job of encouraging employees to take time as they need it, Shapiro said, she worries other employers may use it as a way to cut costs and get more out of their employees.One way companies could save: You won't accrue vacation days that, if unused, the company would pay you for when you quit or get laid off.Right now, only about 1% of companies offer unlimited vacation policies, according to SHRM. So it's too soon to say if it's a trend. But if these new vacation policies prove successful - either by improving employers' bottom line or by creating happier workers -- it may not be long before other businesses give them a try.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

They're there for a reason.-- Back off and avoid getting too close to the car in front of you.-- Watch for flickering in the headlights of oncoming traffic, a signal an animal may be crossing in front of that vehicle.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Four days after losing to the University...<COL>LAHAINA, Hawaii -- The Pittsburgh Panthers' early-season trip to paradise was anything but fun in the sun, and facing a versatile San Diego State Aztecs squad did not make matters any more enjoyable.Four days after losing to the University of Hawaii as a double-digit favorite in what was supposed to be a tune-up for the EA Sports Maui Invitational, the Panthers were stifled by the well-rounded Aztecs 74-57 in the second semifinal Tuesday evening at the Lahaina Civic Center."Well, obviously we don't feel real good about our performance tonight," said Pitt coach Jamie Dixon. "I told the players they have about an hour to feel sorry about themselves. We played against a very good team tonight that was older, quicker, stronger to the ball than us. We're going to come back and play better tomorrow. That was the message to our guys--they're big, they're strong, they have depth. I give them a lot of credit."Fifteenth-ranked San Diego State advances to Wednesday night's championship game, where it will face third-ranked Arizona.Less than 24 hours after squeaking past BYU in a 92-87 double-overtime thriller, San Diego State proved that short rest was not an issue by making short work of the Panthers. The squad from Southern California improved to 16-0 in its past 16 regular-season games when faced with 24 hours or less to prepare for an opponent."I like how we played," said Aztecs coach Steve Fisher. "We played together, we guarded hard and made it difficult for them to get easy shots and we fought like crazy on the glass. They're a very good offensive rebounding team, and they showed it again tonight."But I thought the way we played, shared the ball and moved the ball is indicative of maturity (and a team) that cares more about winning than their own personal stats. When we do that, we've got a chance, because we've got good players, you all know that. Tomorrow we play a team that's as good as any team in the country."The Aztecs (5-0) fell behind 2-0 to begin the game, but they would not trail again. San Diego State established a 14-point halftime lead that would swell to 20 early in the second half.The double-digit win added to San Diego State's impressive streak of 125 consecutive victories after holding a lead with five minutes to play.Guard Trey Kell led the Aztecs with 15 points and dished out three assists before getting an early trip to the bench to rest once the game was well in hand. Forward Winston Shepard gathered seven boards and added 13 points to aid San Diego State, which outshot Pitt from the field, 58.7 percent to 37.7 percent."Over these past games ... I feel comfortable with my teammates and coaches," said Kell, a freshman. "I'm helping the team, and we're coming out with victories."Shepard, a junior playing in his second Hawaii tournament in three years, is growing fond of Island life -- especially with winning serving as the norm for the Aztecs."I love it (Maui). Hopefully when I get to be Coach Fish's age, I'll have a house out here," Shepard said.Guard James Robinson led the Panthers with a game-high 17 points. He converted all six of his attempts from the foul line.Despite being overmatched, Pittsburgh (3-2) did not fold and used a 7-0 run capped by a 3-pointer from forward Ryan Luther to trim the Aztecs' lead to 13 with 15:22 remaining in the game. San Diego State countered by clamping down on defense, and after clogging the paint and employing aggressive full-court pressure, pushed its advantage back up to a comfortable 21-point margin midway through the second half.San Diego State junior forward Skylar Spencer continued his block party, posting five blocked shots a night after collecting five blocks against BYU. The Aztecs entered the game tied for 12th nationally with 28 blocked field goals and added 10 more to that total Tuesday night.The Panthers could not overcome 17 turnovers and did not take advantage of a surprising 35-22 edge in rebounding over the larger, more active Aztecs.NOTES: San Diego State improved to 5-0 to start the season for the fourth time under coach Steve Fisher and for the seventh time in the program's Division I history, which dates back 44 years. The last time the Aztecs opened a season 5-0, the squad finished at 34-3 and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. ... San Diego State made it to the semifinals by getting past BYU 92-87 in double overtime Monday evening. The Cougars responded earlier Tuesday by torching host school Chaminade 121-85 in consolation play, converting a school-record 17 of 29 3-point attempts in the blowout victory. ... Pittsburgh coach Jamie Dixon had two stints as an assistant coach with the University of Hawaii (1992-94 and 1998-99), where he served under former head coach Riley Wallace.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Most dolphins are killed for their meat, while some are sold live to aquariums around the world.Locals defend the hunt, a long-held tradition, as no different than slaughtering any other animal for meat.But activists say the hunt is driven by greed."This brutal hunt is carnage carried out in the name of profit, not culture," said Melissa Sehgal, a Sea Shepherd campaign coordinator. "These dolphins do not belong to Japan; they belong to the ocean."The group says that 15 pods of dolphins have been slaughtered in the cove since this year's hunting season began, with approximately 170 dolphins killed.The Taiji Town Office declined CNN's request for comment on Sea Shepherd's newest report.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

She visited the White House and tucked it into the guard rail."I Love Ferguson," it said.It was mid-October and her beloved city turned restive after the police shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown. Businesses were boarded up and losing money, protests had on occasion turned violent and anxiety had spread through the city of 22,000 people northwest of St. Louis.Ferguson, the quiet community she chose to make home, had become synonymous with racism, injustice and police brutality. Wheat wanted to scream.Her Ferguson was not what it had become in the headlines.For this 45-year-old white woman, things were far more complex than they appeared in the news. The world that she, like many others, saw as black and white had morphed into myriad shades of gray over the years.She has been married to Ken, who is black, for almost two decades. She adopted Christopher, a black child from a foster home. In eight years, he will turn 18, Brown's age at the time of his death, and embark on life in a world she knows is still full of hate.She raised him in a biracial home and tried to make race a nonissue. She wanted Christopher to grow up colorblind, even though America wasn't.But after Brown's death, she couldn't shield him from race or anger anymore.Ferguson changed overnight into what she describes as a poster child for the nation's racial woes."I do understand racial profiling exists," she says, explaining that she is not opposed to people demanding justice. "No one here has a problem with the peaceful protesters. But nothing good comes from violence."She drives me along South Florissant Road, Ferguson's "Main Street," where there has been a recent push to revive downtown businesses. She takes me to the lake at nearby January-Wabash Park, where her son goes fishing, though he rarely catches anything, she laughs. And to a new community center that she helped open.She stops her car in the vast parking lot of Schnucks grocery store, where one day in August, the Missouri National Guard amassed their armored vehicles."Mommy," enquires Christopher. "They had tanks? Why?"Christopher is too young to grasp the magnitude of what has become known as "Ferguson" but he thinks it's "OK for people to be angry." He doesn't like that "bad things" are happening here. He heard a protester threaten his dad and hurl profanities at his mom.We make our way to the QuikTrip gas station that became ground zero on the first night of violent protesting."This is the QT that was burned," Wheat says."For no reason," says Christopher, finishing his mother's thoughts.Wheat understands that Ferguson is a tale of two cities. Her adopted hometown is made up of parks and gardens and historical homes; it's a place where families are trying to come together to build a community that benefits everyone.She understands, too, that there are parts of the city in which another tale is unfolding: of impoverished young people who see no way out of their frustrations. She wishes more black families would get involved in the community by volunteering or simply turning out to vote.She blames poor civic engagement by African-Americans for the gulf between the races. She believes that Ferguson's black youth are being co-opted by outsiders into inciting violence."We live here," she says. "This is our home. We have to live here long after everyone is gone." She is referring to the media and what she believes are mainly outsiders who have descended on Ferguson to protest and add chaos."Ken and I have never felt out of place here," she says. "We've never felt we couldn't cross the tracks. But now, there's a forced separation of the races. It's sad."Growing up amid desegregationWheat grew up about an hour west of Ferguson in the cities of Eureka, best known for its Six Flags amusement park, and Times Beach, abandoned in 1982 because of the nation's worst dioxin contamination.No email address was supplied by.

That's about 95,000 cigarettes! All these years later, writing that figure still makes me feel sick to my stomach. (Or should I say, lungs?)Like a lot of teenagers in my day, I started smoking in high school. At the time, 1973, it was the cool thing to do and if there was anything I aspired to, cool was it. Sucked into the rip tide of popular culture, my juvenile-delinquent brain gravitated toward anything that questioned authority or was anti-establishmentarian, just like my heroes.Too young to go to Woodstock, I could still bang out a Joan Baez tune on my guitar, recite enough lines of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" to prove I was cooler than cool and buy cigarettes. Nobody stopped me. A cigarette dangling from these radical lips was part of the image I had carefully crafted for myself.Cancer? Didn't give it a thought. And nobody at home mentioned it either. This, despite the fact that neither my mother nor my grandmother, with whom we lived, smoked. The war in Vietnam, the protests against it, the music, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, the psychedelic drug scene, feminism and the whole counter-culture movement was way more intriguing than President Nixon's war on cancer.Only old people got cancer. Like my dear Uncle Frank, who died at 48 -- an astonishingly young age, I later realized -- of throat cancer, when I was in eighth grade. He started smoking at an even younger age than me.My high school in the suburbs of Baltimore had a smoking lounge my junior year, 1975. It was outside the cafeteria, so students could smoke before school and during lunch break. Regardless, smoking didn't stop in the bathrooms, and I have plenty of suspensions on my record to prove it. I was addicted.Still, I had a responsible side. I worked like a dog at a pizza joint in town and felt I had earned the right to spend my money the way I saw fit. Heck, I was bringing home $52 a week and spending less than $3 on my nicotine habit, with cigarettes costing 35 cents a pack.You know you're hooked when, despite being bedridden with a terrible case of strep throat at 17, you're craving a cigarette. Or when it's 2 in the morning and you're too tired to drive to 7-11, so you scrounge through all your ashtrays, fishing for a butt with a modicum of tobacco left. Or you're with friends and they light up, so you light up because that's just good social courtesy, right? It was pathetic.I started coughing my junior year of college, especially in the morning. I was an English major spending all my free time writing poetry and song lyrics. Those Marlboros got me through many all-nighters, typing papers on Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Edgar Allen Poe.The drinking age at the time was 18 and the college bar scene was hopping. Hell, we were just having fun, were young and invincible and had plenty of time to do "the adult thing" after graduation. I'd quit then.But I didn't. It was 1982 and I had moved to Vermont. I netted about $100 a week working at a department store, as the demand for poetry and song writers wasn't what I had hoped. Depression and cigarettes made comfortable bedfellows. Compared to a lot of things I could be spending my money on, cigarettes were tame and cheaper, I kept telling myself.But a major change was taking place.When I heard that secondhand smoke could harm the people around me, it was hard to swallow. More than two-thirds of nonsmokers and half of all smokers believed smoking was hazardous to the health of nonsmokers, according to a 1978 Tobacco Institute report.I was hurting myself and innocent bystanders. Sadly, it didn't matter enough.By 26, I was waking up regularly in a cold sweat, my pulse racing so fast I thought I was having a heart attack. Subsequent medical attention ruled out cardiac issues, but a chest X-ray revealed some significant "shadows" for a person my age. The doctor clicked his tongue annoyed, "You should give up smoking. It's just not cool."For two years, I lived with the horrible burden of panic attacks, not knowing what caused them or how to stop them. Then one day, in a brilliant moment of clarity, I realized that I was scared to die. I was scared to die from the effects of smoking cigarettes. It was all so clear -- I had to quit smoking.I had read about the Great American Smokeout in the local newspaper. It was the following Thursday, November 20, 1986. My mother's birthday. It was the nicest present I could give her -- she didn't think smoking was very ladylike -- and the present I had to give myself.I quit cold turkey and never looked back. Sometimes that first year I would wake up with nightmares that I had started smoking again. I had to shake myself until I realized that I hadn't and embrace, once again, my victory over dependence.Twenty eight years later, I've lived a second life with a wonderful marriage, two beautiful daughters, and many incredible adventures. I've never once craved another cigarette or had a panic attack. At 56, I'm still finding out just how cool life really is.Did you grow up when cigarettes were cool? Share your story in the comments.

They were each fined nearly $103,000 but face no jail term.Diplomatic initiativesThe United States has supported efforts by regional group ASEAN to draw up a code of conduct to defuse maritime disputes, but China has said it prefers to deal with the issue bilaterally.On Friday, a Pentagon spokesman told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the U.S. wanted China to stop its land reclamation program and engage in diplomatic initiatives.In a speech at the G20 summit earlier this month, President Barack Obama said the U.S. planned to deepen its diplomatic and military engagement in Asia and would work to ensure that big nations don't "bully the small."An editorial posted in the Global Times, said that Vietnam, the Philippines and the U.S. should "get used" to China's island construction and its more frequent presence in the seas.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

That's where timber comes in."They'd rather this be their steady eddie, slow-as-you-go type of asset," said Moon, who's based in Dallas. "They like transparency. You can go see it if you want to. It's not like a piece of financial paper like a stock or a bond."Many clients do end up visiting their land, and some even use it for recreational purposes like hunting and fishing. A few build log cabins, "to get away from the stress of the world," as Moon puts it.How it works: Owning your little slice of timber heaven doesn't come cheap. The minimum timber investment at U.S. Trust is $5 million, though that will get you a couple thousand acres on a few different parcels, most of which are located in the Southeast, Pacific Northwest, and New England.Older trees closer to harvest typically cost more than younger ones that still have a ways to go before they're ready to be chopped down.Once they're ready for harvest, U.S. Trust will negotiate the best deal with the local logging company, and then oversee the process of making sure they're cut down in an efficient and environmentally sound manner."The clients can get involved if they want to or just sit back," said Moon.Be patient for returns: Measuring timber investment returns isn't cut and dry.Timber prices themselves are closely tied to the housing market and haven't returned to their pre-recession levels, noted Dr. Robert Abt, a professor of forest economics at North Carolina State University.He pointed out that even as the real estate industry has come back since the crisis, much of the new construction is in multi-family homes, which typically require half as much wood."If you're uncorrelated with the stock market but highly correlated with the housing market, it's not that much different," he said.Abt suggested that potential investors do their homework outside of the bank by talking to independent forestry experts. Location, he claimed, is key, since timber land closer to paper mills and saw mills will typically have a more reliable cash flow.He also believes that timber land is overvalued right now because investor demand in recent years has chased up prices.But Moon insists that timber is a long-term play, and that most clients see it as a tool to transfer wealth from one generation to another. While it's true that younger trees don't necessarily provide direct income, he said that owners will often cover expenses by granting hunting licenses and selling off pine straw, which is commonly used in landscaping."If you sell too early, you're not letting the biological engine work for you as much as you should," he said.Investors can also profit off the appreciation of the land, which many see as a hedge against long-term inflation."We're not playing the commodity game...we're owning the dirt," said Moon.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

The dorsal fin of one of the whales sliced up out of the water, protruding more than four feet out of the water, like some kind of black windsurfing sail.These transient orcas, which may have traveled to the Pacific Northwest from as far away as Central America, appeared to be sharing a snack: an unlucky harbor seal."They'll feed on harbor seals, sea lions, other whales, on animals as large as blue whales," Foster explained.Foster has a lifetime of experience working closely with killer whales, one of the world's largest predators. His unique relationship with orcas is one that has evolved over the decades.By his own account, the Seattle native was only 15 years old when he first got involved with capturing killer whales in Puget Sound.In the 1960s, this port was the birthplace of the captive killer whale industry.For Foster, the son of a prominent wildlife veterinarian, getting the chance to work with the Seattle Marine Aquarium capturing and training killer whales was a dream come true."It was amazing to have these big, giant, powerful animals and you're manipulating these things around like they're almost a balloon," Foster recalled.'Things started changing'In the early days of the captive whale industry, Foster and his colleagues were celebrated for their achievements. In 1965, when his mentors captured the first killer whale, Namu, Foster says they were given the key to the city of the Seattle, and featured in National Geographic.Foster captured a couple dozen whales during almost two decades, beginning in 1972. He says during that time, the industry experienced tremendous turmoil."In a few short years, things started changing. People realized that these animals were highly intelligent and we started learning more about them in the wild," Foster recalls. "We learned that these whales stay in social groups for their entire lives."Activists began to question the manner in which whales were captured."When they saw how the captures took place, there was a lot of outcry," Foster says.In 1976, Washington state sued SeaWorld, then Foster's employer, for allegedly violating the terms of permits used for whale captures and won.Foster says that as part of the decision, "we agreed that we would no longer capture killer whales in Puget Sound, but we would instead get permits from outside the country."So Foster and his team packed up their operation, and headed to Iceland, where he worked as a contractor for SeaWorld and other companies and began capturing the large sea animals in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.The former killer whale hunter shared hours of home videos of the captures, some of which he filmed in the 1980s.In some cases, Foster can be heard narrating as fishing trawlers operating in the open ocean encircle a family of killer whales and isolate individual animals."Still got two [whales] in the net. Oh! We got four in the net!" Foster says in one video, filmed at night.When the fishermen then hoist a young whale out of the water using a crane and a net, the whale can immediately be heard emitting high-pitched squeals of panic.The distress calls continue hours later, after the whale has been transported to land and eventually lowered into a shallow pool.In one of the videos, Foster can be seen helping a recently-captured young whale swim in the chest-deep pool. The animal is so disoriented after capture that it is unable to keep itself upright in the water. Dressed in bright orange dry-suit and sporting the same shaggy blond haircut he wears today, Foster guides the whale around the pool, massaging its flippers.In a separate video dating back to 1986, four young whales are seen lying at the bottom of a drained pool, periodically squealing as a veterinarian injects them with antibiotics, and as other members of Foster's team hose them down with water.No email address was supplied by.

But as I progressed, I felt this framework is not necessary for me, so I shoot both in Japan and other places."Her latest book "Ever After" is a continuation of that first series and saw travel across the world shooting in new locations. But her singular views of Japan are perhaps the most captivating.The commingling of the natural and the man-made is a consistent theme for Narahashi."(In Japan) nature exists within reach of people," she said. "You'll find old and new buildings or billboards and other artificial things randomly mixed along with nature. The natural and man-made are constructing landscapes while permeating each other."But as the tsunami of 2011 illustrated to devastating effect, the natural and human worlds do not exist in harmony. The catastrophe also had a significant impact on Narahashi and her photography."After seeing the images of the 3/11 tsunami, knowing the scope of the disaster, it was a time when I questioned whether I could continue to shoot in the same manner as before," she said."Since I began the series I had been thinking that both 'fear' and 'consolation' are in my photographs in the state of being suspended in mid-air, unable to go up or down. But after 3/11, I felt like the pendulum had swung to the 'fear' side."The only answer I could find was to continue to take photographs. In last few years, I'm continuing to shoot in the sea but I have more occasions to shoot in rivers and lakes in (the) last few years than before."Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Each application costs $5 to $10 and applicants can apply for up to 3 permits for each species.The state Department of Fish and Game has 3 tips to increase your odds of winning:-- Apply for hunts where a higher number of permits are awarded. Some hunts offer more than 200 permits and other only 1.-- Review the rules so your application isn't rejected. Last year, nearly 160,000 permits were filed and more than 9,500 were rejected because of errors.-- Research where you'll be hunting to see if it's a hunt you'll be able to find success with your skills or budget.The Department of Fish and Game says last year drawing permit hunt applications brought in close to $1 million drawing permit hunt that was used in part to determine animal populations and determine how many applications can be awarded the following year.The application deadline is5 p.m. Monday, Dec. 15, 2014. People will be notified of their results on Feb. 20, 2015.No email address was supplied by.

Leftover turkey sandwiches are a classic for a good reason -they’re delicious. Get creative and use some fancy relish or melt the cheese or add some stuffing, gravy or cranberry sauce. Or throw some bacon on there for a flavor boost.BrothMaking a delicious soup base is easy with a leftover bird. Boil those turkey bones in a big pot with a carrot, onion and stalk of celery. Strain the bones and extra turkey stuff, and you have instant, inexpensive and tasty turkey broth. Now you’ve got a delicious base for soups. The broth freezes well so you can enjoy that bird year-round.Go GreenGrab some lettuce and your favorite salad fixings. Toss on a little diced turkey and make a fabulous vinaigrette with your cranberry sauce, a little oil and vinegar. Turn stuffing into homemade croutons with a quick bake in the oven. It’s a healthy, light meal and uses some of your yummy holiday leftovers.Roll It Into A CasseroleStep one: Put your left over turkey (or whatever protein you have), vegetables, starches, gravies, noodles, etc. in a baking dish. Step two: Bake. Fora shepherd’s pie twist, add leftover mashed potatoes to the top to form a crust, and voila, another new meal.Cranberry Sauce RevisitedA little cranberry sauce goes a long way, so there’s bound to be extra. But the tart treat goes well in a variety of recipes and adds a pick-me-up to the pile of starch-heavy leftovers. For a sweet-tart contrast, use your cranberry sauce in a muffin recipe or as an ice cream topping.Feed The BirdsThere are plenty of recipes for day-old rolls or bread. But here’s an easy way to give away food and feel some redemption for eating a fowl on Thanksgiving. Bring the old bread to the park and feed it to some hungry birds.Stuffing For BreakfastA frittata is a baked or pan-fried egg and cheese dish, and it makes sense to add leftover stuffing to the mix. Warm some stuffing in a pan, add some cheese, then add some whisked eggs and milk. Cook on stovetop or broil in oven until the egg is cooked through. This is great for anyone who likes eating breakfast at any hour of the day.Squash SoupSquash soup is a cousin of tomato soup. Both are nourishing, simple and complement a variety of dishes. Squash soup can be gingery, cheesy or nutty. Or just plain. Try a spoonful of sour cream or yogurt on top.EnchiladasEnchiladas are delicious and taste quite a bit different than the traditional turkey dinner. They require an ensemble of ingredients but precooked turkey, pre-shredded cheese and canned ingredients including enchilada sauce, olives and maybe chiles make preparing these delights a simple process.Crab CakesWhen we’re ready for something completely different than the standard Thanksgiving fare, use your leftovers for crab cakes. The crab (or any sea being) is about a180-degree turn from heavy turkey. And what makes the fish or crustacean form into a cake shape? Bread crumbs from your leftover rolls or stuffing, and mashed potatoes. It’s a guaranteed way to reinvent some sides into anew taste sensation.istockWith a refrigerator full of Thanksgiving leftovers, try these ideas to make use out of the turkey and sides.iStockGet gift ideas for what to get the teens on your gift list this holiday season.No email address was supplied by.

Bill Walker announced more appointments of commissioners to his cabinet Monday, as well as weighing in onhis inauguration just a few hours earlier.Walker began the 2 p.m. event in Juneau by signing a document authorizing his cabinet appointments and designated line of succession, flanked by Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott.Two new commissioners were named by Walker Monday. Valerie Davidson,formerly with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium,will head the Department of Health and Social Services, while former Eagle River state representative Sam Cotten will serve as acting commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.In addition, Marty Rutherford -- oncethe leader of former Gov. Sarah Palin’s natural-gas pipeline team-- was named deputy commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, until University of Alaska Fairbanks research vice chancellor Mark Myers can fill the post on a permanent basis.The appointments are among Walker’s first moves to fill positions in the executive branch. Former North Slope Borough chief financial officer Randall Hoffbeck was named last month to lead the Department of Revenue, while former Alaska Wildlife Troopers head Gary Folger --appointed in January as Department of Public Safety commissionerby departing Gov. Sean Parnell -- was retained in the position.Last week, Parnell left behind a surge ofmore than 80 appointments to state boards and commissions-- all positions which serve at the pleasure of the governor.Channel 2’s Adam Pinsker contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Seven people were rescued in a life raft, with one person confirmed dead and 54 people -- up two people from an initial count of 52 -- now missing.“A Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak HC-130 Hercules airplane crew and the crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Munro with an embarked Air Station Kodiak MH-65 Dolphin helicopter were dispatched to the scene Monday morning,” Honings wrote Monday afternoon.Officials with the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries initiallytold CNN Monday that seven people have been rescuedfrom the 60-person crew, which includes 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian.The New York Timesidentifies the sunken vessel as the 1,753-ton trawler Oryong 501,with officials at trawler owner Sajo Industries saying the ship was apparently hit by a wave while hauling in a catch of pollock. Those rescued were in a life raft, while other crew members in life jackets jumped into 14-degree water.The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission saysthe Oryong 501 was built in 1988,originally as a tuna longliner.Honings said the Russian request for help didn’t come for some time after the sinking.“We offered assistance and the KBGD accepted our assistance,” Honings said. “It happened late Sunday evening and they accepted our offer early this morning.”Despite the extreme distance from U.S. facilities -- estimated at 580 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor by the Coast Guard Monday morning -- Honings says the search will be conducted without Russian basing or assistance by HC-130 aircrews flying out of Kodiak.“They’re doing the search and they’ll stay out there until the crew is fatigued,” Honings said. “Then they’ll be relieved and keep searching until the search is called off.”Honings said Kamchatka authorities remain the primary search-and-rescue coordinators for the search, about 15 miles into Russian waters from the Russia-U.S. border, with the Coast Guard not authorized to release updates on its progress.“All of our information on the rescue is coming from Russia, so it’s secondhand information,” Honings said.An HC-130 sent Monday is en route back to Kodiak, with a relief flight expected to launch Tuesday morning.The Coast Guard reports sea conditions in the search area as including 22-foot waves and 57-degree water temperatures, with weather reported at half a mile of visibility with a 250-foot cloud ceiling.On April 16, South Korea suffered an even greater maritime loss with the capsizing of the ferry Sewol. More than 300 people died in its sinking, witha South Korean court sentencing ferry captain Lee Joon-Seoklast month to 36 years in prison for violating “seamen’s law” and abandonment causing death and injury.The final death toll from the sinking may eclipse that of the only other large-scale Bering Sea fishing vessel to sink in recent memory, the Alaska Ranger on March 23, 2008. Five people died but 42 other crew members were rescued when the fishing processor went down about 120 nautical miles west of Dutch Harbor, witha National Transportation Safety Board report (PDF)attributing its sinking to flooding after the apparent loss of its rudder.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Even if you live amid picture-perfect paradise, there's only so much nature you can take before you need to get back inside to watch a movie, and the summer is a great time for some excellent films.Since the mid-1970s, so-called "summer movies" have been the blockbusters that everyone sees and movie studios rely on to keep throwing millions of dollars at A-list celebrities.Sure, there are still thoughtful, dramatic pieces, but they don't stand a chance during the summer, because that's when the movies are let off their chains and we get the movies that America wants to see.We are an ugly people, but we know what we like: low-brow comedy, spaceships and lots of explosions.Let's take a look at some of the movies you might want to enjoy after a day next to the pool.Prince William and Kate start their whirlwind tour of New York City on Monday, one that could include mingling with the American version of royals.No email address was supplied by.

An original idea? Perish the thought.So, as you head out to the theaters this weekend, join us for a look at five of the oddest source materials ever tapped for a movie.No. 5: "Clue"OK, so "Battleship" isn't exactly the first movie to spring from a board game.But at least 1985's "Clue," based off the popular Parker Brothers murder mystery board game, had some sort of back story.The movie found the six characters well known to anybody who's played the game -- Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard -- invited to a strange house where they must cooperate with the staff to solve a murder mystery.The cast for this comedic take on the board game included Tim Curry, Martin Mull, Michael McKean, Christopher Lloyd and Madeline Kahn, and, in keeping with the game, had three possible endings, with different theaters receiving each ending.While the film has found a cult following today, its gimmicky endings couldn't save it in 1985 and it languished at the box office, failing to earn back its $15 million price tag.No. 4: "Super Mario Bros."With movies like "Tomb Raider" and the "Resident Evil" franchise having shown life at the box office, movies based on video games may not seem as strange as they once were.But the very first movie based on a video game, 1993's "Super Mario Bros." is a head-scratcher. Sure, Mario and his brother Luigi were the biggest names in video games, but who thought two plumbers collecting coins while battling turtles and mushroom monsters was ripe for a live-action movie adaptation?That didn't stop stars like Bob Hoskins, Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo from joining the production, which saw Mario and Luigi discover a portal to a parallel universe under the streets of Brooklyn, New York.The movie was rightfully trashed by critics (and Hoskins, who called it "the worst thing I ever did") and proved to be a box office bomb, recouping only $21 million of its $48 million budget.No. 3: "Transformers"Some may argue that since Transformers first became a cartoon and a comic book, Michael Bay's 2007 movie adaptation actually sprung from those sources, but we know better.Whatever the media, the message of Transformers has always been about one thing: selling toys.And what toys they are. Anybody who grew up in the 1980s likely has fond memories of acting out battles between the Decepticons and Autobots (unless you had well-meaning-but-still-sadly-mistaken parents who instead bought you Gobots).But is that a good enough reason to invest $150 million in a movie blockbuster?No. 2: "Pirates of the Caribbean"Back in 2003, Disney was the source of much ridicule for attempting to turn one of its most popular amusement park rides into a blockbuster movie.Prince William and Kate start their whirlwind tour of New York City on Monday, one that could include mingling with the American version of royals.No email address was supplied by.

It is aimed at spurring discussion on how to address the changes.Researchers said changes in ocean chemistry could affect shellfish and other small creatures from building skeletons or shells in the early stages of development. Red king crab and tanner crab also grow more slowly in more acidic water.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The mountain can be seen from many places in Alaska, but the town of Talkeetna is one of the best.<COL>Less than one mile from downtown Talkeetna, thousands of tourists become speechless at a Denali look-out point. The mountain can be seen from many places in Alaska, but the town of Talkeetna is one of the best.The town sits at the confluence of the Talkeetna, Chulitna and Little Susitna rivers. The Dena'ina Athabascans were the first inhabitants of the area who found both food and natural resources in abundance."They were able to get all different types of food," said Jayme Spires with Talkeetna Historical Society. "They were able to go from the Anchorage area all the way up to Talkeetna and not many people could do that."It has been a hundred years since the first summit of Denali. Walter Harper, an Alaska Native, was the first to conquer the mountain on June 7, 1913. Since then, many hikers have done the same, but some have lost their lives trying.The mountain has long been a major draw to the Talkeetna area.

At the time, it was a tent city beside Prince William Sound.Most of the original town site was destroyed during the 1964 earthquake and the tsunami that followed, which killed more than 30 people.Andrew Goldstein, curator of collection and exhibitions at the Valdez Museum, says the entire town was condemned after the quake and the Army Corp of Engineers recommended that what remained of Valdez be moved.

The mountain can be seen from many places in Alaska, but the town of Talkeetna is one of the best.The town sits at the confluence of the Talkeetna, Chulitna and Little Susitna rivers. The Dena'ina Athabascans were the first inhabitants of the area who found both food and natural resources in abundance."They were able to get all different types of food," said Jayme Spires with Talkeetna Historical Society. "They were able to go from the Anchorage area all the way up to Talkeetna and not many people could do that."It has been a hundred years since the first summit of Denali. Walter Harper, an Alaska Native, was the first to conquer the mountain on June 7, 1913. Since then, many hikers have done the same, but some have lost their lives trying.The mountain has long been a major draw to the Talkeetna area. It has served as a support community for food, flights and lodging, but without its golden moment, it wouldn't be a quintessential Alaskan town."People from the lower-48 learned about a gold strike and thought they could do it and Talkeetna just exploded," said Spires.Not many people came to Talkeetna during the early gold rush, but one form of transportation, the train, definitely made it easier.

The photos illustrate Chitina’s legacy.There’s a picture of a group of prospectors in front of what could only be described as a boulder of copper ore, maybe the piece that sparked the copper rush that would help create the town. Going down the line, the photos change with the times.Susan is confident there are more photos than there is available wall space to hang all of them.The history of Chitina is intrinsically tied to its aptly named hotel and vice-versa.In 1908 Chitina came to life as a transportation hub for the Kennicott Mine and the railroad that would support it. Copper mining turned Chitina into a boomtown and when the railroad finally reached the town in 1910, people started coming faster. It wasn’t long before Chitina’s population was exceeding thousands while Anchorage remained a tent city. As the population rose, the need to find lodging for everyone quickly became a necessity.Now the Hotel Chitina today was not the Hotel Chitina of the early 1900s. At that time there was another Hotel Chitina at the time filling that role. The building that would come to be what is now known as the Hotel Chitina started off as the Arctic Brotherhood Hall – the predecessors to the Pioneers of Alaska – built in 1914. The building served as a community hall and later a nickelodeon-style movie theater.By the late 1930s the hope locals had that Chitina would become Alaska’s capitol began to diminish as rapidly as the Kennicott mine’s production of copper did. By 1938 the mine closed and it wasn’t long before Chitina became a ghost town.However, the Arctic Brotherhood Hall would survive and in the 1950s it was converted to the hotel and restaurant it is today by Wesley Kennedy.Kennedy owned the building for only one year and the hotel would exchange ownership for years until a man named Curley Randolph purchased the building in the early 1970s.The hotel continued to welcome guests through the days of the Trans-Alaskan pipeline’s construction. By the end of the decade Randolph would close the hotel and it would stay closed.Over the next 30 years the population of Chitina continued to diminish. Buildings as old as the town itself were abandoned; they fell into disrepair or burned to the ground. For the most part, the Hotel Chitina survived despite being abandoned for decades.Then something unexpected happened.A married couple from Valdez with a passion for BBQ’d steak and adventure took a detour off the Richardson Highway heading for Chitina.“Every year for my birthday, my husband would ask me, ‘what do you want for your birthday,’” Susan said. “I would say I want a steak cooked over an open fire.”Susan’s birthday didn’t exactly fall in good BBQing weather for Valdez, so Lance and the rest of the family packed the car and the two made their way for Chitina, where the weather was warmer and not nearly as rainy.Each time they would pass through town, Lance and Susan drove by the dilapidated carapace that was once the Chitina Hotel.“Lance would say ‘someone should really do something with that old building,’” Susan said.This went on for years, and each time Lance would say the same thing. Then one day someone really did do something with that old building.“I finally said OK,” Susan said.Those two syllables would change the Gilpatricks’ life forever.The Gilpatricks purchased the building in 2001, but in the 30 years since the hotel was open, Alaskan laws had changed. It turns out the 100-year-old hotel had somehow obstructed Department of Transportation right-of-way without ever having moved. But move it the Gilpatricks would have to, if they ever wanted to actually operate the building.No email address was supplied by.

The movement's momentum has sputtered and leaders of different protest groups are split over what action to take.Hong Kong's chief executive C.Y. Leung responded to news of the hunger strike by telling students to "take care of their health, especially in this cold weather."The city's temperature has dipped to a crisp 15 degrees Celsius (59 Fahrenheit) after months of heat and humidity. Wong says he will only consume water.'We are all tired'Reactions were mixed to Wong's announcement of the hunger strike."Kid, you're too young. You think (Hong Kong's leader) will give you real universal suffrage because of a hunger strike?" said one commenter.Other democracy supporters accused Wong of staging the hunger strike as a way of achieving a "glorious retreat" without accomplishing anything.An online statement issued by Wong's protest group, Scholarism, acknowledged the hunger strike was a desperate measure. "We are all tired, our hearts are weary; as we face this high wall of a government we are like a weak, frail, egg," it said."But we are not afraid of people laughing at our dreams; we are afraid of hearing the sounds of our broken dreams in the future, afraid of having no more dreams at all."Scholarism is not new to hunger strikes: In 2012, members of the group staged a hunger strike outside Hong Kong's government headquarters to oppose a proposed pro-Communist high school curriculum.After vocal protests from thousands of supporters, officials eventually withdrew the plan.Occupy founders announce 'surrender'Not long after after Wong's hunger strike began, the three middle-aged founders of the Occupy Central movement announced they would not escalate their actions, but would instead surrender to police."For the sake of the occupiers' safety, for the sake of our original intention of love and peace, as we prepare to surrender, we three urge the students to retreat," law professor Benny Tai announced at a press conference.Tai first came up with the idea to "occupy" downtown Hong Kong to call for universal suffrage but he has not always seen eye-to-eye with students leaders, who kicked off the current protests two months ago.Many of Hong Kong's committed protesters do not consider the Occupy founders to be their leaders, and are unlikely to be influenced by Tai's call for retreat.Wong told CNN if the Occupy founders want students to retreat, then "(the Occupy founders) should urge the government to get a discussion with the students."StandoffStudent leaders have grown increasingly desperate for a breakthrough. On Sunday night, student leaders called on supporters to surround Hong Kong's government headquarters Sunday night, leading to a violent nighttime standoff with police in which protesters were bloodied and ultimately beaten back.The next morning, police briefly moved on the main protest site, removing some tents, banners, and barricades before withdrawing.No email address was supplied by.

Instead, the website is steering commenters to social media."We thought about this decision long and hard, since we do value reader opinion," co-executive editor Kara Swisher wrote. "But we concluded that, as social media has continued its robust growth, the bulk of discussion of our stories is increasingly taking place there, making onsite comments less and less used and less and less useful."The announcement was just the latest in a recent wave of prominent websites removing or significantly scaling back their comment sections. Reuters, Popular Science and the Chicago Sun-Times have recently nixed comments.Fairly or not, comment forums have gained a reputation as a haven for Internet trolls. Several of the sites that have banned comments noted the lack of civility in their decisions."As the news arm of a 141-year-old science and technology magazine, we are as committed to fostering lively, intellectual debate as we are to spreading the word of science far and wide," read a Popular Science post from last September. "The problem is when trolls and spambots overwhelm the former, diminishing our ability to do the latter."Like Re/code, Reuters said social media was a factor when deciding to shut down most of its comments this month."Much of the well-informed and articulate discussion around news, as well as criticism or praise for stories, has moved to social media and online forums," a November 7 post read.Other websites have opted to moderate comments more strictly rather than disable them altogether.At the Gawker Media family of sites, which includes Gawker, Jezebel, Lifehacker, Deadspin and Gizmodo among others, most comments must be approved before appearing. The new system was rolled out after Jezebel's comment sections were flooded with animated GIFs of violent rape images."The mouth-breathing (expletive)s behind this deserve a reluctant congrats: A+ trolling job, many headaches induced, ruined a lot of peoples' days, etc.," Jezebel wrote in a post noting that the problem was being addressed. "You've given us a stunning example of just how unfathomably ugly the internet can be."At CNN, comments on most stories were disabled in August. They are selectively activated on stories that editors feel have the potential for high-quality debate -- and when writers and editors can actively participate in and moderate those conversations.Editors and moderators now regularly host discussions on CNN's Facebook and Twitter accounts.Despite our best efforts to contain them, trolls are a persistent group and keep managing to slip through the gates.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

...<COL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The Buffalo Bills certainly have rivalries established with AFC East foes New England, Miami and the New York Jets, but there is also noticeable ferocity when they play their Lake Erie neighbors, the Cleveland Browns.Because the cities share blue-collar values and have similar unbridled passion for their football teams, the games against each other have some added meaning because there is Rust Belt pride at stake. The city of Buffalo often is the brunt of jokes, and Cleveland isn't far behind.Or maybe the other way around, depending on where you hear about this.Now Sunday's game at Ralph Wilson Stadium has even more juice after Fred Jackson and Aaron Williams called out Browns safety Donte Whitner, a former Bill, for some spiteful comments he made on Twitter during the summer.For some reason, Whitner -- the Bills' first-round draft pick in 2006 -- decided to do some Twitter trolling of Bills fans.With the team's ownership situation still in flux at the time and Bills fans fearing that the team could be moved to Toronto with rock star Bon Jovi serving as the face of a Toronto ownership group, Whitner tweeted: "Can you say Toronto Bills?!?!?!?!" He then followed that with, "Wonder how you Bills fans gonna feel when the team is moved? LOL."The night he sent those tweets, he was confronted on Twitter by Bills legend Darryl Talley, and the two engaged in a spirited, sometimes expletive-filled back-and-forth. One of the most entertaining Talley offerings was, "Funny thing. If I saw u I wouldn't know u to fall over u. 25 years later people still recognize me." Whitner actually challenged Talley to a boxing match, to which Talley laughed.When asked about Whitner on Wednesday, Jackson, who normally plays the role of Switzerland when it comes to controversy, fired away with guns blazing."That's just him being him; Donte is a guy that likes to ruffle feathers," Jackson said. "He found any way he could to try and ruffle Buffalo's feathers, knowing he had to come up to us (to play Sunday). That's just him doing what he does, but at the same time, I mean, it's annoying. It's just dumb for him to do and talk about people like that and talk about the city of Buffalo like that. But at the same time, you've just got to take it with a grain of salt and say it's just some dude that's being an idiot about some stuff."Weeks before the Toronto tweets, Whitner also took some shots at Bills rookie receiver Sammy Watkins. The Bills selected Watkins with the No. 4 overall pick thanks to a trade with the Browns. Weeks after the draft, Watkins made a comment about looking forward to playing against the Browns, a team that might have picked Watkins. Whitner felt that disrespected the Browns, and he tweeted, "Be quiet, Sammy. Trust me!"Veteran Bills safety Williams caught wind of that, and he leapt to the rookie's defense."I tried to step in," Williams said. "I don't know why he'd fire on a rookie. Just having my teammate's back and letting him know, at the time, welcome to the team and we have your back, no matter what."Williams, who joined the Bills as a second-round draft pick the year Whitner left to join the 49ers, knows that Whitner caught some flak from Bills fans because he never really lived up to being the No. 8 overall pick in 2006, and that may have fueled his attacks on Watkins and the fans."People here don't like Donte, and Donte don't like people here for, once again, for whatever reason," Williams said. "My concern is not with that or how he feels about Sammy. My concern is how to stop (Josh) Gordon and the rest of the receivers and Jordan (Cameron) and how to slow down their quarterback. I'm gonna let Sammy take care of Donte."Interestingly, while Williams said the Bills need to keep their focus on the Browns because this is an important game for two teams that are in the playoff race, Whitner's responses Wednesday indicated that he believes he has disrupted the Bills' concentration."If they're over there talking about this, maybe we are in their heads; maybe I'm in their heads. Maybe," Whitner said. "The goal is to get them talking about things other than football, and I guess that's what they're doing."When asked to address Jackson's comments, Whitner said, "I will shake his hand. I don't really care about words and personal feelings and things like that."Beyond the Twitter spats, Browns coach Mike Pettine is returning to Buffalo to play against a Bills defense that is one of the best in the league, a defense that he helped lay the foundation for in 2013, his only season as Buffalo's defensive coordinator."I wouldn't be sitting here in this chair if it wasn't for that group," he said of the Bills' defense. "It'll be healthy competition. I'm going to see a lot of those guys before the game and look them in the eye and wish them well, and I'm sure they'll do the same to me. We're going to go out and compete against each other and, after the game, we'll shake hands and off we go. I thoroughly enjoyed the year I was there. It was tough to leave that group."NOTES: Among those who did not practice Wednesday were TEs Chris Gragg (knee) and Lee Smith (non-football illness). WR Robert Woods (ankle) was limited. WR Marcus Thigpen was claimed off waivers and DE Bryan Johnson was cut.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Wh...<COL>Are you ready for the "most honest conversation you'll ever have?"That's how VProud describes itself -- an apparently troll-proof website for women to discuss everything from politics to their sex lives, all without fear of garnering online abuse.While four in 10 internet users have been harassed online, according to the Pew Research Center, young women suffer the brunt of more extreme abuse -- 26% have been stalked online, and 25% sexually harassed.Now Karen Cahn, a former Google, YouTube, and AOL video executive, thinks she might have the answer to keeping trolls at bay.Her new social network filters out what she describes as "Mean Girl" language."Our definition of 'troll' is all about rude, hateful, mean, and unproductive comments," explained Cahn."And these comments can come from men and women."In the VProud world, users are verified through their Google, Facebook, and Twitter accounts -- though they still have the option of commenting under a public or anonymous profile.Is Cahn the equivalent of a modern day "Troll Slayer?" We'll soon find out.CNN: What is VProud?Karen Cahn: VProud is a digital safe space for women to have intimate conversations with each other, without feeling like the whole world is going to see what they are saying, and without trolls making hateful and unproductive comments.It's an open platform where women can participate in discussions started by someone else, or start their own conversation and invite other people to join in.CNN: How does it keep out trolls?KC: We have 4 lines of defense against trollish comments:1. A database that understands context, and over time can determine whether a comment is intended to be disruptive.2. Filters that catch words and phrases that are against our community guidelines.3. Editors who live and breathe VProud conversations, making sure the dialogue is one that is productive.4. On every piece of content and comment on the site, there is a troll icon. If someone is being hateful or disrespectful, users can report the troll and our community managers will review it.CNN: Can you still post content anonymously?KC: Yes. Women can choose to participate in discussions using one of two identities: VPublic, which is their social username, and VPrivate which is a custom username. She can toggle back and forth between the two identities based on the conversation she's involved in.For example, I may be perfectly comfortable talking about yoga or girls education with my real name, Karen Cahn, but I'm certainly not going to comment about my sex life or intimate issues using my real name. Instead, I will use my VPrivate name. You know, so my Aunt Gertrude doesn't see what I'm saying.CNN: Are you concerned about limiting free speech?KC: VProud is about the democratization of conversation. We are not the arbiters of opinions. We are not Democrats or Republicans, we are not pro-choice or pro-life. What we don't approve of is "Mean Girl" behavior -- name calling and putting people down.But we are not about censorship -- we just think you can have productive conversations without engaging in that type of behavior.CNN: What inspired you to set up the site?No email address was supplied by.

Stunningly, executive Emil Michael suggested -- in what may have been off-the-record comments -- that the company might not be above threatening journalists who criticize Uber.In the past, Uber supporters have offered excuses for the company's blunders, saying that its speed of growth creates stress and contributes to mistakes. Uber seems to make many mistakes. Tracking a journalist's whereabouts with an app called "God View," or conflating the Uber on-demand car service with a fictitious on-demand service trolling for women that CEO Travis Kalanick calls "Boob-er," are not good ideas.But the story is more important than PR gaffes and immature jokes.Uber is the latest example in a long line of organizations and professional cultures guided by corporate narcissism. Such companies are so consumed with preening and filling their coffers that they lose sight of their customers. When taken to an extreme, corporate narcissism can put customers at risk. They can even be physically hurt and have their lives turned upside down in disastrous ways.Consider the number of people whose lives were shattered in the 2007 mortgage crisis. Led by a notoriously narcissistic company, Countrywide Financial, the rapacious mortgage and banking industry zeroed in on new profits from record numbers of mortgages by giving unqualified borrowers loans. Who cared if folks couldn't pay back the money?When the inevitable housing market crash came, countless lives were left in ruins as the roofs over their heads were taken away. The financial meltdown was so epic that we're still recovering from it today. Yet, most of the mortgage and banking institutions involved remained standing despite the big mess.Or consider the NFL. Revelations of NFL players who were hardly punished for domestic violence incidents or charges of drug addiction have become almost commonplace. And what about players who suffer brain damage, depression and dementia, as a result of repeated concussions -- a situation long covered up by the NFL? It seems like the NFL keeps its eye more on league success at the expense of player ethics and safety. Where's the accountability?Or consider Target, whose CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, lost his job earlier this year after presiding over many missteps, including a massive credit card data breach that affected millions of customers. If Target had heeded early warnings from its IT department, maybe this could have been prevented. But the company seemed to have lost its focus, and the protection of customers' privacy didn't garner as much attention.One need look no further than the past few months to see Uber barreling down similarly narcissistic paths. And people are pushing back asking, among other things, if their personal safety is at risk when they get in an Uber car. Can they really trust that this company, with such apparently impulsive and aggressive leadership, will protect them and ensure a positive experience?What companies need is a culture of consumer accountability. But Uber is going in the opposite direction. None of the 8 Uber "competencies" that are expected of employees focuses on appealing to customers, much less consumer values like responsibility for passenger safety, privacy, data protection or the right to a rating-free experience after a ride.Uber's privacy policy is vague and not transparent, which could lead to abuses of customer data security, especially in full-steam-ahead cultures where the message is anything goes if it drives scale. The company has yet to address what it will do with the abundant customer data it collects with every ride. But even in the absence of these protections, a company whose CEO thinks of women as "Boob-ers" may not be perceived as one that has every consumer's interest at heart.The company may see this moment of blowback as a speed bump on its way to world dominance -- an inconvenience that can be managed by an expert political campaigner, a PR challenge that can be smoothed over through private dinners with media influencers. In reality, Uber is a company at major risk of losing its lead in the market. The app is easily copied and the service it provides erects no barriers to competitive entry. If Uber changes its approach from narcissism to accountability by focusing on consumer relationships and loyalty, it will have a chance at a bright future.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

Operators with Aerovironment, designers of the drone, were on hand to pilot the machine, which looked like a miniature airplane.The drone, a “Puma All Environment UAS,” or “unmanned aircraft system,” flew from the Healy’s bow as part of the Coast Guard’s “Oil in Ice” exercise, and as a test of the machine’s abilities in Arctic environments. Operators also used the drone’s infrared and electro-optical camera to provide video of the exercise’s simulated oil spill.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Many members say they are still reviewing the details.At a news conference afterwards, Boehner said his members realize their hands are tied on the immigration issue until Republicans control both chambers of Congress in January."I think they understand that it's going to be difficult to take meaningful action as long as we got Democrat control of the Senate," Boehner said.Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican in line to become the next Senate majority leader, reiterated his view that the GOP should stop threatening shutdowns."We need to quit that kind of rattling the economy," McConnell said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council.The government will run out of money on Dec. 11 unless Congress acts. Last year's government shutdown was politically disastrous for Republicans and the party is trying to avoid a repeat just as they're on the cusp of retaking full control of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade.The GOP plan discussed on Tuesday calls for the House to vote on legislation that would fund most of the government through September while only funding the Department of Homeland Security, which would carry out key parts of the executive orders, until just sometime in March. That would give Republicans time to pass legislation blocking the immigration orders.House Republican leaders are trying to balance competing priorities in the party. They want to mollify conservatives who are furious over the President's decision to make it easier for millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country by providing a clear opportunity for them to try to block the action.After hearing about the plan Tuesday morning, some of those House members on the right say they will oppose it because it would continue funding for agencies tasked with granting new visas through March of next year."You just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days? Kind of like being a little bit pregnant? It doesn't work for me," Arizona GOP Rep Matt Salmon told reporters.But other Republicans -- including leaders in both chambers -- are fearful of tying that move to government funding.Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack said now that voters gave his party control of both the House and Senate in the midterms it's was important to demonstrate that they can govern and not "give any opportunity for buyer's remorse on the part of the discerning electorate." He said there was a "narrow window" for Republicans to show they can run the government before voters size up the parties again before the 2016 election.A vote on the bill is likely next week, aides said.Testifying before a House committee on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson urged lawmakers against legislation that would fund his department for a shorter period of time than the rest of the government."That is, in my judgment, a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period ..., we cannot engage in new starts," Johnson said. "For example, we are back in a presidential election cycle. I cannot hire new Secret Service agents until I get an appropriations bill passed by this Congress -- not another (continuing resolution) for a couple of months."Senate Democrats generally support the President's immigration orders and oppose the House plan to fund DHS just through March. But after meeting with his caucus Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid it would be a "big accomplishment" if the House passed a bill that funded most of the government and signaled he would support it.Separately, the House likely will vote this week on a bill that essentially calls out Obama on immigration. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte has drafted a bill that would allow members to "vent" about their unhappiness with the executive action.Illinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam said the separate vote declaring the president violated the Constitution by using executive authority on immigration is to demonstrate to constituents that the GOP opposed the president's actions."Silence is assent so to not respond in any way is in some fashion to be complicit in it, so this allows members to be on the record and clear about it."However, the bill would have not legal binding authority and the Senate is sure to ignore it.Salmon said he would vote for the bill because he opposed the president's immigration actions, but then he essentially dismissed it, saying, "it's not going to go anywhere and everyone's knows it."In addition to the funding strategy, House GOP members are also still considering whether they should sue the President for the issuing the directives that they consider unconstitutional.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

These hops are referred to as "wet hops." Whole fresh hop cones provide a more grassy and juicy aroma and flavor to the beer by retaining precious lupulin oils from the hop flower.Wet hop beers are the ultimate example of farm-to-glass, and are designed to celebrate the agriculture of beer. Brewers in Oregon and Washington obviously have an advantage in getting the freshest picked hops, but more and more breweries outside of the hop growing regions are going to extreme lengths to get the freshest hops into the brew kettle.I gathered as many of these "freshies" as I could get my hands on for a taste test, along with a group of fellow beer lovers, and have listed the cream of the crop. These harvest ales won't be available much longer, so you better hop to it and try some today.Please share your favorite wet hop beer in the comments below.Northern Hemisphere Harvest -- Sierra NevadaSierra Nevada has been brewing up wet hop beers since 1996, so they have got it down. They even produce a wet hop beer from hops grown on their estate in Chico, California. The fresh Centennial and Cascade hops give this balanced beer some citrus and herbal notes, but they're not overpowering. Definite pine and grassy notes crop up at the end, but the sweetness from the malts calm things down a bit.Born Yesterday Fresh Hop -- Lagunitas Brewing CompanyThis was the clear front-runner this year in the wet hop category. The freshness of this pale ale really shines through from beginning to end. Tropical fruits and pine hit you across the face right upon opening it up, and it should, considering the lengths that Lagunitas went through in order to get this beer in your hands as fresh as possible. The wet hops are truly the star of this pale ale.Harvest Ale -- Founders Brewing CompanyWho knew that one of the best wet hopped beers would be straight out of Grand Rapids, Michigan? It's a brilliantly juiced up IPA with intense pine and tropical fruit flavor. The fresh hops shine all the way through to the finish. According the brewery, fresh hops from both Washington and Michigan were used in this year's batch of their delicious harvest ale.Chasin' Freshies -- Deschutes BreweryThis IPA features fresh cut Mosaic hops trucked in straight from the fields in nearby Yakima, Washington. Tropical notes are again showcased in this one, along with heavy pine and subtle bread-y sweetness. Super clean and crisp, and a very easy drinker for 7.2% alcohol by volume. Deschutes also serves up a fresh hop pale ale called Hop Trip, which is worth a try as well.So Fresh & So Green, Green -- Terrapin Beer CompanyEach year Terrapin pays tribute to the hop by featuring a single wet hop that is flown down on a midnight plane to Georgia from Yakima. This year Terrapin features Simcoe, which is a heavily aromatic hop that gives lots of earthy pine and passionfruit characteristics. This brew tastes like a freshly mowed lawn of pine needles, with a fruity slightly bitter finish. It is a truly another one hop wonder from Terrapin.Sensi Harvest -- Sixpoint BreweryThis is one juicy fresh hop beer, which is surprising given its very drinkable 4.7% ABV. Brooklyn's Sixpoint uses only seedless hop cones in this session IPA to deliver a citrus-y but not at all bitter brew.Vine to Victory Harvest Ale -- Victory Brewing CompanyA very ambitious undertaking by Victory to get a whopping six tons of fresh hops hauled in refrigerated trucks from Yakima Valley to their Downingtown, Pennsylvania, brewery for this fresh hop offering. Tons of grapefruit and a pungent hop aroma lead the way, alongside Victory's signature malts, provide a bread-y sweetness.Fresh Hop -- Great DivideAnother early adopter of the wet hop movement, Great Divide give us a pale ale with grassy hop flavor with heavy grapefruit and a little pine on the finish. Moderate bitterness and an all-around well balanced beer.Warrior IPA -- Left Hand BrewingProbably the only wet hop beer on the list not featuring Pacific Northwest hops. Warrior is made with fresh wet Cascade hops from the high altitudes of Colorado. Once harvested, the hops are loaded onto a small plane and flown about an hour to the Left Brewery in Longmont, Colorado.Heavy-Handed IPA -- Two Brothers Brewing CompanyTwo Brothers from Chicago put out three separate versions of their Heavy Handed fresh hop IPA, with each one featuring a single hop. This year they have released them in Chinook, Centennial and Cascade. We were able to get our hands on the Cascade version of this beer. The Heavy Handed was probably sweeter than most of the fresh hop beers we tried, with a caramel flavors with a citrus twist.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

"This takes place both in cities and in villages -- in villages of the richest and the poorest nations on earth."A diverse group of faith leaders gathered at the Vatican on Tuesday to sign a declaration pledging to "inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of good will everywhere" to eradicate slavery by the year 2020.Leaders and representatives of Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, Shiite and Sunni Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism all were present and signed the initiative.CNN has championed the cause of eradicating slavery, having launched its Freedom Project in March 2011.An estimated 35.8 million people are enslaved, according to the Global Slavery Index. As the Pope pointed out, the problem is far from limited to developing countries: More than 60,000 people are estimated to be enslaved in the United States, more than 10,000 in Germany and more than 1,000 in Sweden.Most victims in Europe and Central Asia are forced into sexual exploitation, the United Nations says; in East Asia and the Pacific region, most are used for forced labor."The victims come from all walks of life, but most times they are the poorest and the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters," Francis said.The joint declaration calls modern slavery a "crime against humanity," and says that eradication in less than a decade is achievable."Today we have the opportunity, awareness, wisdom, innovation and technology to achieve this human and moral imperative," it states.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

All ringed seals are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.In a statement requesting public comment onits critical-habitat proposal,NOAA says the suggested designation is a necessary part of the Arctic seals’ ESA protections.“The proposed critical habitat area in the northern Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas provides sea ice conditions that are essential for the survival of Arctic ringed seals,” NOAA officials wrote. “The designation of critical habitat areas, land or water under United States jurisdiction that includes habitat features essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species, is required for species listed under the ESA.”NOAA Fisheries Alaska regional administrator Dr. James Balsiger said the critical-habitat designation will help protect ringed seals, as scientific evidence shows sea ice “is projected to shrink both in extent and duration in the future” according to the NOAA statement.“After reviewing the best available information, our scientists identified the habitat features that are essential for sustaining Arctic ringed seals -- a species that is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future due to climate change,” Balsiger said. “We look forward to hearing from members of the public on this proposal.”Sen. Lisa Murkowski, however, took a different view of the NOAA request Tuesday afternoon, questioning why the agency chose to designate roughly 350,000 square miles of Alaska waters as critical habitat for the seals.“NOAA’s justification admits several non-scientific reasons motivated its decision, such as ‘enhanced public awareness’ and that the proposed designation ‘may help focus and contribute to conservation efforts,’” Murkowski’s office said in a statement.Murkowski also took issue with the broad range of activities the designation might affect. If approved, federal agencies overseeing industries ranging from oil and gas drilling to commercial fishing would have to clear proposals with NOAA, to ensure they didn’t affect ringed seals.“This is an unprecedented attempt to place restrictions on a larger than Texas-sized area of water surrounding our state,” Murkowski said. “I remain skeptical that the listing of ringed seals based on a 100-year weather projection was justified, and I am concerned that this designation would severely impact any economic development from Northwest (Alaska) all the way to our border with Canada.”NOAA plans to issue times and locations for hearings on the ringed-seal critical habitat shortly, with a 90-day public comment period now open. In the meantime, written comments can be mailed to Jon Kurland, the Alaska region’s assistant regional administrator for protected resources at NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, at P.O.

The Coast Guard’s first HC-130 flight in support of the search returned to Kodiak early Monday evening.“Unfortunately, we didn’t find any survivors yesterday,” Honings said.Petty Officer 1st Class Shawn Eggert, another Coast Guard spokesperson, said Tuesday afternoon that debris and rafts had been found in the search area. There wasn't any confirmed link to the Oryong 501, however.The Coast Guard cutter Munro, which is carrying an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter, is still en route to the search area as well. Eggert said the Munro wasn't within range to launch its chopper in support of the search Tuesday, with an expected arrival Wednesday evening.Honings said the Coast Guard hasn’t received any updates on the search from the Kamchatka Border Guard Directorate, which initially requested U.S. assistance Monday morning.Weather conditions were improving in the search area Tuesday, according to Eggert, and were expected to be even better Wednesday.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

And then the pain got worse, and worse, and worse," he explains.A period of agonizing limbo involving hospital visits, tests and scans came to a horrifying conclusion with a diagnosis of bone cancer.He embarked upon a course of chemotherapy but after five months of treatment the tumor showed no signs of shrinking and the decision was made to amputate his left leg above the knee in 1999. He was 19 years old."I just thought to myself: 'now the professional sports dream that I have is out the window.' So I had to do something else," he says.Sveinsson exchanged the fast-paced action of the handball court for more gentle pursuits like golf and fishing. Understandably, given his circumstances, he lost interest in keeping fit and piled on the pounds during his 20s.But when he took a job in R&D at the Icelandic prosthetics company Ossur in 2009, it wasn't long before his competitive spark was reignited and his sporting career resumed with a flourish.Based in Reykjavik, Ossur has forged a global reputation as a leading manufacturer and developer of prosthetic knees, legs and feet.Their carbon fiber running blades were famously worn by the Paralympian Oscar Pistorius and dozens of other para-athletes around the world use their equipment today."Ossur has been my inspiration for the things I am doing today. To be able to be around and talk to the biggest names in Paralympic sports made me want to do it. I have a lot to thank them for," he said."To be able to run again at the level I am doing, it's just unbelievable. This is one of the best inventions ever," he says pointing down to his carbon fiber blade.At first, Sveinsson used it exclusively for sprinting, competing in the 100m, before also taking up the long jump, but his true calling came a little later, more by happy accident than choice."I was warming up for the long jump and I saw a javelin lying on the grass. So I picked it up, tried one throw and that was my thing. The old handball shoulder was back," he said, noting the similarity in the throwing techniques of the two sports."It's pretty much the same rhythm.

Seven of the ship’s 62 crew members were rescued after a wave struck the pollock trawler while it was loading its catch Sunday, with 43 people still missing.The search for the missing crew is being coordinated by the Kamchatka Border Guard Directorate in Russia. The Coast Guard wasn’t initially involved in the search, about 580 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor, butcommitted assets after a Russian request for assistanceMonday morning.Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 1st Class Kelly Parker said Wednesday morning that no bodies have been found in its search efforts. An HC-130 search plane from Air Station Kodiak is on the ground in Kotzebue and will take off at first light to continue search efforts, with the cutter Munro and an embarked MH-65 Dolphin helicopter expected to arrive later in the day.“Our Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley has also been diverted to assist in the search,” Parker said.Coast Guard searchershad found debris and boats Tuesday,but it wasn’t clear whether they were from the sunken vessel.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Of course, when you fill the back of the boat the front goes up in the air."Fortunately, fuel tanks stayed elevated and out of the water, so nothing was spilled into the harbor. The U.S. Coast Guard said did not even need to respond, and Tougas is working with captains to get the boat leveled out between 6 and 8 p.m., when tides are cooperating.The boat should be up and running well ahead of the next wave of tourists, Tougas said, with the ship getting dry docked and the engine repaired in March.Major Marine owns nine vessels and employs 130 people at the peak of tourist season, and the Spirit of Adventure's usual home is in Southeast Alaska, used for tours around Glacier Bay."It's in Seward now because we have been using it for glacier tours here," he said.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

That's according to a new study led by Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School.<COL>istockEating a Mediterranean diet may be your key to living longer. That's according to a new study led by Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School.The diet involves eating items off a menu that is rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. It keeps dairy, meat and saturated fats to a minimum. And you can have a glass of red wine with dinner without cheating.The diet has been consistently linked with health benefits that includes helping you manage your weight, and it can lower your risk for chronic issues such as cardiovascular disease.This new research looks at data from 4,676 healthy middle-aged women involved in the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing study tracking the health of more than 120,000 U.S. nurses since 1976.It found women who ate a Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres.Telomeres are part of your chromosomes, the thread-like structures that house your DNA. At the end of these chromosomes are telomeres, a kind of protective "cap" that keeps the structure from unraveling. It thereby protects your genetic information.Even in healthy people, telomeres shorten with age. Shorter telomeres are associated with aging, lower life expectancy and age-related diseases such as artherosclerosis, certain cancers and liver disease.Scientists have noticed some lifestyle choices such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking a lot of sugar sweetened drinks can prematurely shorten a person's telomeres.Scientists believe oxidative stress and inflammation can also shorten them.Fruits, vegetables, olive oils and nuts -- the key components of a Mediterranean diet -- have well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The team of U.S. researchers led by De Vivo therefore wanted to see whether the women who stuck with this diet had longer telomeres."This is the largest population-based study addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle aged women," they write. The study included completed detailed food questionnaires and blood tests to measure telomere length.Each participant had a calculated diet score ranging from 0 to 9 points; a higher score signifies a closer resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. Each one point change in diet score corresponded an average of 1.5 years of telomere aging.Telomere shortening is irreversible but healthy "lifestyle choices can help prevent accelerated shortening," says De Vivo.This study's results provide "some insight into the underlying physiologic mechanism behind this association," indicating that greater adherence to this diet is significantly associated with longer telomeres, she says. Because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean diet, following this diet "could balance out the 'bad effects' of smoking and obesity," De Vivo says.These findings further support "the health benefits of greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet for reduction of overall mortality, increased longevity and reduced incidence of chronic diseases, especially major cardiovascular diseases."None of the individual dietary components was associated with telomere length. Researchers suggest that means the whole diet is an important element, rather than one item being a kind of superfood.Dr. Peter Nilsson, a professor of Clinical Cardiovascular Research at Lund University in Sweden, who wrote an accompanying editorial, suggests that the variation in telomere length and dietary patterns may also be because of genetic background factors.While promising, Nilsson believes that future studies "should take into account the possibility of interactions between genes, diet and sex."With these results, De Vivo and her research team hope in the future to figure out which components of the Mediterranean diet may be having a bigger impact on telomere length.Next they also hope to study the same thing in men.Copyright 2014 byCNN NewSource.

The deadline to apply for the hunts is quickly approaching.<COL>Anchorage moose hunts remain in limboHunters are allowed to apply for a limited amount of drawing permit hunts and some of those application may be wasted on hunts that are cancelled.The Anchorage advisory committee for the Department of Fish and Game holds the power to authorize local hunts. It's going back and forth on what to do with a number of hunts including two hunts limited to disabled veterans, two hunts for archers only and one hunt for muzzleloader use only.According to the Department of Fish and Game the affected hunts are...DM423, DM425, DM441, DM443, DM666, DM 426, DM427, DM421It says two additional hunts could be affected but they are not currently held hunts.In total about 70 permits would be removed from the books if the advisory committee does not reauthorize the hunts. Department of Fish and Game Assistant Biologist Dave Battle says the earliest those hunts could be brought back would be 2018.There was some debate that the number of permits could be lower if they were changed to bullonly hunts. The department says it would not do that for most of the hunts because the season for the hunts is later, therefore some moose may have dropped their antlers making it harder to determine if they are a bull or cow.Tuesdaynight the advisory committee held a meeting where the public was encouraged to share their opinions about the decision to not reauthorize the hunts.The meeting lasted more than 4 hours with about 15 people speaking. Almost everyone speaking said they want the hunts to remain available.Advisory Committee chair Joel Doner says, "There are those that don't want to reauthorize. They're on the committee, they're out in the community. As a committee we just need to weigh all those points of view."Tuesdaynight the committee voted 11 to 3 in favor of overturning it's original decision to not authorize the hunts. However, it did not reauthorize the hunts. It will address reauthorizing the hunts at the next meeting in January.The deadline to apply for the hunts falls before that, on Dec. 15. Leaving many hunters unsure if the hunts they are paying to apply for will be cancelled or allowed.According to Donor, the reasons to not reauthorize the hunts include not receiving moose population data from the department of Fish and Game, some members lacking trust in the departments data, and some members being opposed to harvesting cows, pregnant cows, cows with calves or calves.Battle says the Anchorage moose population can sustain the moose hunts. He says removing either sex of moose from the population will contribute to community safety by reducing moose and human interactions, like car crashes.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Well … sometimes. Although you might think you have the right to do whatever you want in the privacy of your backyard, your local government may have very different ideas. Quite a number of practices are restricted by federal, state, or local law, even on your own property, usually for reasons of hygiene and safety. Make sure you know your local regulations before trying any of these.DISCLAIMER: This article is for general informational purposes and not intended as legal advice.1. Collecting rainwater.While "direct rainwater collection" is okay,rainwater, roof water, and meltwater harvestingare not sanctioned in many US states. This means your harmless-looking rain barrel or cistern may be illegal.2. Using greywater (aka "graywater").Repurposing the runoff from laundry, dishwashing, or showers to water your garden is a no-no in certain areas.3. Watering your lawn when and how much you please.If an outdoor water-use restriction is in effect, irrigation may bepermitted only at certain times and on specific days of the week, if at all.4. Digging a pond.Would you like to have your own backyard pond to store water, to swim in, or for any other purpose? You will need to check with your local government before you lift a shovel.5. Raising chickens.Your right to harbor hens depends on zoning laws for your area. For example, Multnomah County statutes require you to file for a permit to keep more than three chickens on your property. A fence should surround your chicken enclosure to keep them safe and keep out rodents. In addition, you must inform your neighbors within 150 feet of the property line of your plan.6. Keeping vehicles on your property thatare not registered to your address, licensed, and operable. (If all the criteria are met, though, there is no limit to the number of vehicles you can have on your land.) Storing a vehicle with GVW (gross vehicle weight) of over 11,000 pounds  is also proscribed unless you get land use approval.7. Holding a fundraiser or any event for which you charge admission, especially if alcohol will be served.8. Disturbing a legally registered archaeological site.However, you could be entitled to benefits such as tax breaks and easements, and any artifacts found might belong to you. The correct procedure if you find what may be a historical artifact on your land: leave the object where it is and contact the state official in charge of historical preservation.9. Digging for goldif the mineral rights to your property have been signed away by you, the house's builder before you bought your home, or any other authorized person.10. Keeping cuttings from a neighbor's trees.While in most areas you or your agent have the right incommon law to trim branches that extend over your property line, may not do so in a way that causes irreparable harm to the trees. And sorry, but the cut wood is off limits.11. Composting whatever you wish.Adding cooked food, meat, fish, human or animal wastes, sewage sludge, or synthetic nutrients to a compost pile is prohibited in many areas, as is application of compost made from any of these substances to your garden.12. Camping.Camping out on your own property, whether in a tent, RV, or anything that could be termed a temporary shelter, is completely forbidden in some urban centers. Even in a more rural area, long term camping on residential property may be prohibited. What is the definition of "short term"? Usually it is less than 30 days. In addition, each camper may be required to have a bedroom in the house.13. Growing (too many) vegetables.Urban gardening is not allowed in some US cities. Even if you are permitted, there may belimits on how much produce you can grow.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/13-things-you-probably-cant-do-in-youNo email address was supplied by.

"A tractor-trailer came around the corner and fish-tailed and struck her vehicle, and because she was getting out of the vehicle she was struck."Twitter messages from police said Minnesota was closed entirely at the offramp and down to one southbound lane at its intersection with International Airport Road. Myren said southbound lanes had reopened as of 1 p.m., followed by a brief closure of northbound lanes to remove the tractor-trailer from Minnesota's median.APD is asking drivers struck in crashes to avoid remaining on major roads, assuming their vehicles are still mobile."If they're able to, we encourage people to get off the highway," Myren said. "If they can get to the nearest offramp, it's better."Channel 2's Chris Klint contributed information to this story.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Bill Walker on Arctic issues.Craig Fleener was named as a special advisor to the governor last week. Fleener was Walker’s running mate as an Independent candidate, but dropped out when Democratic nominee Byron Mallott joined Walker in a successful "unity ticket" against incumbent Gov. Sean Parnell."We are the reason the United States is an Arctic nation -- but in my opinion, Alaska has played a backseat role where the U.S. has been a driver,” Fleener said. “My interest is making sure that Alaskans' and Alaska's interests are at the forefront of decision-making."The U.S. will take the rotating chairmanship of the eight-nation Arctic Policy Council in April.Fleener, originally from Fort Yukon, said his immediate goals will be helping the state adapt to climate change and building roads in Arctic conditions."I'm very interested in working with different teams of people across Alaska," Fleener said. "We have folks in the administration who have been working on Arctic issues their entire lives or entire careers."Fleener was a member of the Parnell administration, as a deputy commissioner at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, from 2010 to 2013. He also serves in the Alaska National Guard.Walker's naming of Fleener as Arctic advisor replaces Parnell appointee Stephanie Moreland.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Shortly thereafter, Penn's Alek Torgersen was intercepted by Brandon Roe to seal a loss for the Quakers (0-1) in their season opener.Bell finished 20-of-39 for 239 yards while Bryant sparked the Dolphins with 127 rushing yards in addition to four catches for 33 yards and a score. Torgersen was harassed into a 14-of-33 performance for 200 yards with one TD and two interceptions, and he also led Penn with 65 rushing yards and a score.The Quakers scored two third-quarter touchdowns to turn a 19-17 deficit into a 12-point advantage. The Dolphins got closer on Bell's 7-yard scoring strike to Bryant with 6:18 left before pulling ahead on the TD pass to Randle. Penn originally led 17-3 midway through the second quarter before Jacksonville scored the next 16 points, including two touchdown passes by Bell. One of those scores went to Andy Robustelli, who led the Dolphins with 51 receiving yards - the second-highest total in the game behind Spencer Kulcsar, who totaled 110 yards on three receptions for the Quakers.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

There are currently 19 abortion providers in Texas."The overall effect of the provisions is to create an impermissible obstacle as applied to all women seeking a previability abortion," AP said Yeakel wrote in his 21-page ruling.The law would have required abortion facilities in Texas to meet hospital-level operating standards, which supporters say will protect women's health, AP said.But clinics called it a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions, which have been a constitutional right since the Roe v.

Clam Gulch resident Peter J. Janke, 15, ran into what was initially reported as a cable.“Central and Ninilchik EMS responded to the scene with Troopers and located (Janke) deceased after he struck a set-net cable anchored into the bluff while riding a 4-wheeler,” troopers wrote.AST spokesperson Beth Ipsen says Tuesday that Janke was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, but "was reportedly going excessive speeds." She says the rope he hit had been strung between a bluff near the beach and the water."It's a bright yellow rope," Ipsen said. "It was high enough to catch (Janke) across the upper body, the chest area."Megan Peters, another AST spokesperson, noted Monday that while the set-net season is relatively short, drivers of all-terrain vehicles strike other objects like tree branches on a year-round basis.“It’s not uncommon for people riding ATV vehicles to have incidents like this,” Peters said. “Any time someone’s riding an ATV or four-wheeler, they need to be aware of their surroundings.”Janke’s body has been sent to the state medical examiner’s office for an autopsy.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Interior decorators weigh-in on the topic.<COL>By Linda Merrill,NetworxLikely, there is nothing more contentious in interior design than a discussion about the use ofmounted animal heads as decoration. Recently, there has been a resurgence in the use oftaxidermy animals as decoration. Of course, hunters have always shown off their prowess by mounting their conquests’ heads on plaques and hanging them around the house or lodge. Opinions on the morals of hunting aside, why would one hang animal heads if he is not a hunter?Taxidermy gained great popularity during the Victorian era where everything from large animals to tiny little birds and butterflies were mounted and displayed. In some ways, there was a feel of scientific research to this fascination or, in the manner of “momento mori”, depictions of dead things, including humans, were used to remind us of our mortality. But, why would it be popular today?A 2009 article in the New York Times called “The New Antiquarians” profiled Hollister and Porter Hovey, sisters who shared a loft in Williamsburg and a love for all things dark and historical, discussed this trend.  In essence, this is a reflexive action against the bright and shiny of today. But it goes deeper than a simple nostalgia for the “good old days”. While I do believe that the true “modern antiquarian” lifestyle is more extreme than most of us are willing to go, there is something oddly comforting about being surrounded by things that have withstood the test of time, like antiquewoodworking and carpentry.Valerie Steele, director of the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, was quoted in the article saying, “It’s not aspirational and it’s not nostalgic. It’s a fantasy world that is almost entirely a visual collage… an alternative world. Authenticity is such a fed-up idea. But collecting these old things, it’s like there is an aura attached to them. It’s not some prepackaged product being foisted on you by a big corporation.” The Hovey sisters, meanwhile, have sincelaunched their own interior design firm, selling their unique brand of antiquity to willing clients.Which brings me back to mounted animal heads. Why, if one isn’t a hunter, or a hipster antiquarian, would these still be popular design elements? I believe it’s because they come with the aura of the old world, ofmoney and privilege– always popular themes in interior design. The recentPBS series Downton Abbeywas wildly popular, due in no small part to the fascination with the old moneyed country house lifestyle, where shooting was a popular pastime. Whether we live in the city or the country, mounted animal heads, or antlers, bring with them the aura of these days gone by.But do they work in any interior? Not forKate Dickerson, an artist and designer on Cape Cod. Says Kate, “I love animal heads because I’m always old Europe in my imagination. Plus, I hunted as a teenager. My feeling, though, is that they need to fit into the décor. I think they look silly out of context”.Context is, indeed, an important element of successful interior design. While we shouldn’t strive for a museum-like reproduction of a particular period in time, there does need to be a sense of cohesion between the architecture, furnishings and the owner’s lifestyle.  It would take a seriously careful hand to include mounted animal heads in amodern design scheme. Likely as not, the popularity of mounted antlers, both real and fake, is due to the desire for antiquarian, moneyed style in a modern space. They are graphic and sharp, literally, but they have eyes that seem to follow you around the room.Houstondesigner and blogger Joni Webbcautions about the over-use of mounted animal heads in a design plan. “The problem is that people who are really hunters -- they will have 30 or more specimens -- and will want to display them all. That’s when it gets to be too much and, en masse, it is scary looking!”Source:http://www.networx.com/article/the-great-debate-animal-head-decorDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Perhaps not surprisingly, only one person has indulged in the delicacy, UPI reported.A scaled-down version called the C5 is also available for $120 that features roasted garlic, Icelandic scampi, smoked steelhead and lobster ratatouille. Natami has sold seven of those creations so far."I never thought I'd sell so many," he told The Province. "The idea was to make a culinary statement."While certainly pricey, Natami's offerings pale in comparison to the $12,000 pizza offered by Italian chef Renato Viola in 2008, according to TripAtlas.com. For that price, three chefs cook the pizza in your home using mozzarella di bufala, three types of caviar and lobster. The pizza is then dusted with Australian salt hand-picked from the Murray River, according to The Province.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting.

If approved, it would have made it impossible to get an abortion in the state and hamper the ability to get some forms of birth control.Because the amendment defined a fertilized egg as a person with full legal rights, it could have had an impact on a woman's ability to get the morning-after pill or birth control pills that destroy fertilized eggs.It could have made in vitro fertilization treatments more difficult because it could have become illegal to dispose of unused fertilized eggs. This could have led to a nationwide debate about women's rights and abortion while setting up a possible challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wade case, which makes abortion legal.The ballot initiative is part of a national campaign brought by Personhood USA. The Colorado-based group describes itself as a nonprofit Christian ministry that "serves the pro-life community by assisting local groups to initiate citizen, legislative, and political action focusing on the ultimate goal of the pro-life movement: personhood rights for all innocent humans."The idea for personhood was born during Roe v. Wade's oral arguments, when Justice Potter Stewart said, "If it were established that an unborn fetus is a person, you would have an impossible case here." Now, Personhood USA tried to use the amendment to establish "personhood" as a direct challenge to the Roe v. Wade ruling.No email address was supplied by.

That just changed. The same guys who own Humpy’s and Subzero opened Flattop Pizza + Pool on 6th Ave.<COL>It’s something many restaurants in Anchorage haven’t dared to try, Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. That just changed. The same guys who own Humpy’s and Subzero opened Flattop Pizza + Pool on 6th Ave.Executive Chef Tim Farley says the owners were hesitant to serve deep dish pizza but he convinced them to change their minds after he went to Chicago to eat pizza, and craft a plan, to build his own.“It keeps close to the traditional style,” Farley said, “so when you pull a scoop of it out, it’s pretty impressive, delicious.”The restaurant has been opened since May 31st, and there will be a grand opening, street party, July 27th.Like the name implies they have pizza, and pool.There are few tables in the restaurant. Mostly barstool-type seating and you’re encouraged to play at one of the high end pool tables. There is a fee to play. During happy hour, 4-7, it’s $5 an hour and in the evenings it’s $10-$15 depending on the hours and days.The art inside was done by Anchorage artist Duke Russell and he also handpicked the old-timey photos on the walls. The few tables the restaurant does have were refurbished from 100-year-old Douglas fur.The pizza is described as a gourmet, with cutesy names like the Anchortown, which has a garlic ranch sauce, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, grilled chicken, red onions, diced Roma tomatoes and fresh cilantro. There’s also a Powerline Pass pizza with mozzarella, Canadian bacon, hamburger, house sausage, salami, pepperoni and bacon.The dessert menu has some very cool stuff: An ice cream sandwich with brownies, made in-house, and vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream.“It’s ridiculously good,” Farley said.There’s also a beer float made with Kassik’s Roughneck Stout and, again, Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.“It sounds really gross, but it’s actually really, really, good,” Susynn Snyder the promotions director for the company said.I asked Farley how he felt about competing with Anchorage pizza Gods like Moose’s Tooth.“Pizza is such a universal food,” Farley said, “that it’s bound to be successful, we’re in the heart of downtown Anchorage.”Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Join us for a look at five especially dumb criminals whose inability to stay off the social media site cost them their freedom.<COL>Thierry Roge/ReutersIn the past few years, Americans have become social media junkies.Checking status updates, tagging pictures and tweeting are all second nature for most of us by this point. Cellphones have become a permanent extension of the arm, as people wander around checking Facebook and Twitter constantly.The popular social media sites keep friends connected, but some people aren't too careful about what they post. We're not talking about friends that "overshare," like the friend that brags about their kid being potty-trained; we're talking about really dumb posts.For example, some Facebook addicts have actually posted pictures of themselves committing crimes or fibbed on themselves in other ways. To salute this not-so-intelligent use of social media, let's take a look at the five dumbest criminals caught through Facebook.Pennsylvania teen logs into Facebook while stealingPolice say a Pennsylvania teen broke into a Martinsburg, W.Va., home in August 2009 and took two diamond rings from his neighbor.While looking around the home for more loot, Jonathan Parker spotted a laptop. He didn't steal it; instead, he sat down and checked his Facebook account, according to authorities. Apparently it was more important to check up on his friends than run away with the pricey jewelry. Once Parker was caught up on all the happenings, he left with the rings in hand, but he forgot one thing. He didn't log out of his Facebook account. Whoops.When the homeowner returned from work, there were signs of a burglary. Minutes later, the homeowner saw Parker's Facebook account still open on the laptop. Needless to say, it didn't take police long to track down the tech-savvy teen.Parker pleaded not guilty, but was convicted nonetheless.Stealing from a judge, posting proof on FacebookPolice in South Florida called a 21-year-old man "an idiot" after he allegedly swiped a judge's nameplate, took a picture holding the sign and let his girlfriend post the picture on Facebook.Ironically, Steven Mulhall appeared before the judge for petty theft. After his February 2012 appearance, Mulhall apparently decided to lift the nameplate outside the judge's door, authorities said. His girlfriend snapped a picture, posted it Facebook and now Mulhall is facing a felony charge."The nameplate is like only $40, not that big of a crime, but what an idiot. He puts it on Facebook," Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti told the Palm Beach Post."Here he is flaunting it on Facebook. He violated the terms of his parole by stealing, from a judge he appeared before, no less. He's got multiple convictions for petty theft, so now this is a felony."A robber 'friends' his victimsWhen a Massachusetts man filled his tank with gas and came inside to pay in November 2010, the station manger didn't think anything of it, that is, until he pulled the 27-inch flat screen TV off a bathroom wall and sneaked away with it.Nicole Telles, the manger at Prestige Car Wash and Gas Station, decided to track the guy down.With the name from his credit card receipt and a good picture of the crook on surveillance video, Telles found the alleged TV-swiper on Facebook. For kicks she sent him a friend request, and he accepted it. After looking through Facebook pictures and comparing them to the surveillance pictures, Telles knew she had the right guy.Telles' boss even sent the suspect a message, telling him to return the television and they wouldn't call police. In the end, the police were contacted and the robbery suspect was arrested.Constant Facebook updates make for an easy arrestMaxi Sopo led an interesting life; so much so, he felt the need to update his Facebook page all the time. While this is an annoying trait in many people, it rarely lands you in jail, unless you're Maxine Sopo.No email address was supplied by.

Among the many stories, Jeffrey says one man talked about how he got caught by the tsunami in his boat."He ended up starting up another skiff and riding the tsunami into the middle of town and then picking up people along the way," Jeffrey said.The account acts as a reminder of Mother Nature’s destructive power that residents don't want to see again.Maker points out that Kodiak is leading the way in securing pre-disaster funding for seismic retrofits to its schools which would be used as shelters. The borough holds weekly town hall meetings. It also applies federal emergency training for all key personnel."We do our best to ensure that our community will bounce back from such an event as quickly as possible," Maker said. "That system or that training will actually increase our effectiveness with regards to managing the next earthquake or tsunami event."That training came in handy when a recent landslide ripped through town, causing only minor damage. It was the proactive approach that has helped the borough prepare for any potential emergency.Warning systems in Kodiak are operated by different entities with different purposes, for different reasons. For example, the tsunami warning sirens are only controlled by local officials. In other parts of Alaska, the state controls the system.James Brooks recently wrote the book "Kodiak and the World's Second Largest Earthquake." It focuses on how the disaster impacted the island."You really have to rely on yourself, especially on an island because help when it arrives won't arrive quickly under the best intentions," Brooks said.As part of its preparedness, Kodiak is participating in the statewide shield emergency exercise that will be based on a mock earthquake and tsunami event similar to the 1964 earthquake. It will happen March 28 in Kodiak and around the state with live drills, shelters opening, and a mass casualty exercise where people will be loaded on a plane and flown off the island.No email address was supplied by.

Avis Kompkoff was a young mother of one daughter and two sons. Avis remembers an idyllic village where people were kind to each other, people lived off the land and life was simple.On that March day, Kompkoff was heating up water for a steam bath. She distinctly remembers her oldest child, 3-and-a-half-year-old Joanne asking if she could go to grandma’s house. Avis said she remembers a voice telling her to let the girl go.“That voice in my head was telling me to send her home,” Kompkoff said.But she says for some reason something told her not to send her oldest son, Joe. The seemingly benign detail meant the difference between life and death for Kompkoff’s children.Kompkoff was taking out clothes to wear after the bath when Joe started running around and looking scared.“I thought, what the heck is wrong with him,” Kompkoff said. Then she felt the house shaking. “I could see the hot water on the stove shaking,” she said.Kompkoff grabbed her sons, Joe and Lloyd and went outside. People were running. Kompkoff remembers the look of terror on people’s faces and the water getting rough out in the ocean. She saw a man carrying a chubby baby girl, running past. Kompkoff remembers someone yelled, “tidal wave!” and everyone ran.  Kompkoff was only wearing slippers and she lost them running in the spring snow.“I wish I could project it out on the wall and let everybody see what it was like,” Kompkoff said.The best way she could describe it was like the world was being held up by thin puppet strings, and they were “just slowly swinging back and forth and they could break at any moment.”They fled to the school house, which sat on a hill, higher than the rest of the village.  Kompkoff remembers it was 100 steps up the hillside. At the schoolhouse, the teacher gave out her own boots and warm clothing to people who had escaped in a rush. “Everybody’s trying to gather everything, seeing who made it, who didn’t.”Kompkoff remembers her feet were cold when another tidal wave hit the village. She doesn’t remember anyone telling her that her mother, father and baby daughter were gone.“I knew in my heart of hearts that my mom and dad and Joanne didn’t make it,” she said. “They didn’t have to tell me, I knew it.”In a moment, her village was changed forever and Kompkoff recalls an overwhelming sense of grief. The  man’s chubby baby girl died, Avis said, and she remembers the baby’s mother almost mad with grief.A U.S. Coast Guard pilot flew over the village the next day and reported the people were okay. He saw everyone waving from the roof and mistakenly thought they were fine. It took the village’s regular bush pilot Jim Osborne to realize the true damage that had happened to Chenega. As the pilot was flying, he told the villagers, he saw rubble floating in the ocean. The small bush plane could only accommodate a few people. Osborne took several trips to get everyone. As Kompkoff boarded the plane, Joanne’s father asked where Joanne was. “That was a big hurt,” Kompkoff said, “I said she’s with mom and them, wherever they went and the look on his face was horrible.” Kompkoff sat right next to the pilot.The small bush plane could only accommodate a few people. Osborne took several trips to get everyone. As Avis got on the plane, Joanne’s father asked where Joanne was.“That was a big hurt,” Avis said, “I said she’s with mom and them, wherever they went, and the look on his face was horrible.”The tsunamis killed 26 people living in Chenega. It was a heavy toll for any village, but especially one with a total population of only 78 people. The village of Chenega had lost families, friends and one-third of its community. There wasn’t anything for them to go back to. The villagers evacuated to Cordova. From there, it was a blur.A search party found little Joanne Kompkoff a few weeks later. Kompkoff said she was told that part of the girl’s face and stomach were eaten by birds.The local doctor recognized the little girl, “He knew her. He told them, no.” The doctor gave Kompkoff the t-shirt and cross necklace the girl was wearing. Kompkoff said she remembers going to the funeral for her daughter and leaving the ceremony, but what went on, she doesn’t remember.Avis said she remembers going to the funeral for her daughter and leaving the ceremony, but what went on, she doesn’t remember.After a few months in Cordova, the remaining villagers moved to a tent village. Then they moved to Tatitlek for awhile. Kompkoff said they were glad for the help, but it wasn’t home.“There was that lost feeling,” Kompkoff said.Before the quake, Kompkoff described  Chenega as a tight-knit community. The community used to celebrate Russian Orthodox holidays together. Sometimes several of them would get together and go in to Anchorage or Cordova together.Kompkoff doesn’t know why she felt she had to send Joanne to her mother’s house that day. The girl had been the apple of her grandmother’s eye, she said. Joanne was the woman’s first grandchild. Joanne was premature.“She was so tiny when she came home. Everybody wanted to touch her,” Kompkoff said. “But she was my mom’s baby. “Kompkoff said people used to ask Avis how she made a baby to look just like her mama.Kompkoff son Lloyd was only 4 months old when the quake hit, but the horror of that day stuck with the little boy. The horror of that day left him with night terrors“Sometimes he’d run into a wall and he’d holler about the water. He was like that for years,” Kompkoff said.Kompkoff knows that terror. Since the quake, when she feels stressed out, she feels the earth shaking. Kompkoff remembers it happening in Cordova, where she lives now.“I’d have to go downtown and look at the street lights to make sure they weren’t moving,” she said. “Sometimes I felt like the pavement was melted plastic.”Recalling the day is full of odd coincidences. Julia Kompkoff was killed by the tsunami. Kompkoff remembers seeing the girl moments before she died. It was before any of them knew that the day would bring something different. The girl played outside the window of Kompkoff’s house. Kompkoff distinctly remembers looking up to see Julia waving.“They never did find her,” Kompkoff said. “She never did that before.”Julia’s goodbye is just one of many memories that haunt Kompkoff to this day. For years, she felt the topic too taboo to discuss.  Kompkoff said at the time there wasn’t the mental health support systems that exist now.  She felt the topic too taboo to discuss for a long time.Looking back, Kompkoff wishes it was different, “I just wish we had gotten together more and talked about with other people because we never knew what they went through.”Kompkoff doesn’t know if the dreams about her mother will go away.In one, she’s visiting with her mother, “it’s a good day when I wake up.” Other dreams are darker. Kompkoff searches the village for her mother and each house she goes to, she learns her mother has just left, “I’m real irritated when I wake up all day.”Kompkoff said the loss she suffered is something she’ll never completely recover from. She takes comfort in her faith now. “I knew God made the world. They couldn’t convince me that he didn’t.”She described the natural beauty of Chenega and the feelings of being out in Prince William Sound on a skiff. “It didn’t go big bang and there it was. It’s too awesome, puppies and kitties, flowers.”Kompkoff has had the opportunity to see the most beautiful and the most horrific nature has to offer, both experiences have cemented her belief in a higher power, but that doesn’t mean she knows all the answers. Why was her tiny village so devastated by a natural disaster?“There’s a reason for it you don’t know why yet,” she said, “One of these days, you’ll find out.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Family members reported them overdue Thursday morning, prompting an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter to be launched from Air Station Kodiak to search for them.“Approximately two hours into the search the Jayhawk crew located the hunters in good condition and in no distress,” Steve Garcia, a search and rescue controller with the Sector Anchorage command center, said in the statement. “It’s good news that there was no emergency and these guys did the right thing by leaving word with family about their trip intentions. We recommend when plans change people update family or friends.”Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Mooers says it’s not clear whether the hunters had communications gear or any kind of emergency locators, but that they were prepared for their trip.“We received the report that they had taken equipment to stay overnight,” Mooers said.The Coast Guard encourages people heading to remote areas of Alaska to file flight, float or trip plans, as well as bringing multiple forms of long-range communication. While the Coast Guard mentions VHF radios, personal locator transmitters and satellite phones or cellphones, officials warn that not all devices work in all areas.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Ryan Erickson. But shortly after discovering the skiff and kayak Hagan was last seen with, and no sign of Hagan, the crews turned back.“Suspending a case is one of the hardest decisions that we as search and rescuers have to make," said Cmdr. Marc Burd, a response chief for the Coast Guard in Juneau. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family."Hagan was hunting with 51-year-old Adrian Knopps of Grand Ledge, Mich., who was rescued from a beach earlier this week in hypothermic conditions.The two traveled to the mouth of the Chickamin River more than a week ago, aboard the 44-foot vessel Abundance.“They ended up anchoring the vessel just outside the flats, they took a skiff into the shallows and that’s where they were hunting,” Erickson said.Something went wrong, and good Samaritans aboard the motor vessel Wilderness Adventure spotted the Abundance adrift and unmanned, about 10 miles north along Behm Canal from the river’s mouth.Searchers on board a Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter sent to the area deduced that its crew might be ashore near the river, which led them to where they found Knopps.The Coast Guard dedicated two boats to the search: the Chandeleur, a cutter conducting a shoreline search of the Behm Canal, which separates the island from the mainland, and a 47-foot boat that headed down the Chickamin River off the canal's east side.Volunteers from Ketchikan Search and Rescue also searched the shoreline.“One of our search assets went out there and saw this gentleman all alone on the beach,” Erickson said.Contrary to previous reports, Erickson says Knopps was left on the beach for a week, not in a cabin. He was hypothermic when rescued and was flown by the Jayhawk to Ketchikan Medical Center.“He was out there for seven days, with just him and his rifle and whatever gear he had brought with him,” Erickson said.Knopps told the Coast Guard that he last saw Hagan Sept. 15, when the Craig man took the skiff -- loaded with fresh game -- back to the Abundance. There are no indications that Hagan ever reboarded the vessel.“He saw him (motoring) out, and once he got so far out he lost sight of him,” Erickson said. “The plan was to come back and get Mr. Knopps, but that never happened so that’s unfortunate.”Erickson says that Hagan’s 7-foot skiff was towing a blue kayak loaded with gear. The skiff was found Tuesday at Portage Cove, and the kayak was found Monday across the cove at Claude Point near the northern tip of Revillagigedo Island.Channel 2's Austin Baird contributed information to this story.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Eight days later the Abundance was discovered by a Good Samaritan vessel abandoned and adrift at sea in the Behm Canal.An investigation revealed the hunters had anchored their vessel about two to three miles from shore at the mouth of the Chickamin River and used a seven-foot Livingston-style skiff to scout the river. After killing a bear on Sept. 15, Hagen attempted to return to the Abundance in the skiff and a kayak in tow. Knopps remained on shore for Hagen to return, Coast Guard officials report. However, Hagen never returned, leaving Knopps stranded with no survival skill for seven days until Coast Guard crews found him. Upon his discovery Coast Guard officials notified Alaska State Troopers.Knopps was transported to the Ketchikan Peace Health Medical Center where he was treated for severe hypothermia.Troopers report Hagen was found wearing a life vest, but the vest did not appear to be properly secured.Hagen's remains were returned to Ketchikan where it will be sent to the State Medical Examiner's office for autopsy.

He is believed to have been wearing a life jacket.“Search efforts were called off last night due to wind and blowing snow,” troopers wrote. “Efforts resumed at (9 a.m.) today. Currently the search area is 8 miles downriver from Alakanuk.”AST spokesperson Megan Peters says Wednesday’s break in the weather is allowing concerned locals from communities in the area to look for Shelton, under supervision by a trooper.“Fortunately, the blizzard conditions have subsided, and people are in boats out searching,” Peters said.Daniel Noble, 29, and Cyril Murphy, 50, were found dead in life jackets by boaters Tuesday. The sole survivor, 21-year-old John Chikigak, told troopers he removed much of his clothing before making it to shore; he was found on the riverbank Tuesday and treated at a local clinic.“According to Chikigak, the boat had a crack in the hull and water was seeping into the bottom,” troopers wrote. “The men were attempting to bail the water out and decided to pull the drain plug and plane the boat.”Peters says the strength of the skiff’s motor played a role in its sinking.“What they were trying to do, pull the drain plug and plane the boat, it works if you’re going a certain speed,” Peters said. “Unfortunately, the motor wasn’t strong enough to go that fast, so it’s kind of sad.”Troopers say all of the skiff occupants’ next of kin have been notified.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The average resale value is $37,142, putting the cost recouped at 72%.By Linda Merrill,NetworxI grew up in the very “preppy” town of Duxbury, Massachusetts. We were so preppy, in fact, that we got a mention in the 1980Official Preppy Handbook. The thing I really came away with was that being a real "preppy" was something innate. There were those born to the preppy life who were never particularly comfortable there and others whobecamepreppy and fit right in.The preppy lifestyle is not just about fashion (although Nantucket red chinos, Top Siders without socks, and Polo shirts with upturned collars were certainly de rigueur), it’s about a lifestyle. It has the patina of old money and country club tradition, but with a more colorful and casual exuberance. It's definitely not about age, as much of the clothing works for generations and certainly some truly Boston Brahmin preps keep their clothes for that long! True preppy style derives more from the windblown feeling that you’ve just pulled your skiff in after a bracing morning on the water than a white dinner jacket evening at the club.I asked Scot Meacham Wood, ofSMW Design, a Southern boy currently living in San Francisco, his take on modern prep. Known for his great collection of plaid blazers, Wood is the embodiment of casual preppy chic. When asked about preppy fashion, Wood says it’s all about cut and fit. "This current 'preppy movement' is much more body conscious than the one I remember from the 80’s.  This current trend is also a bit more 'weathered,'" he said.  "The clothing has more of a sense of history.  Many people find the tattered oxford shirts and patch-covered jeans to be more of a pastiche. Luckily for me, I still have all the oxford shirts from my college years - so the tatters are legitimate."Wood points to menswear designer Michael Bastian as doing a great modern preppy look. "He has, in the last few years, completely re-imagined the modern preppy male.  Beautiful, classic clothing, but with a fit that is much more body aware than the baggy khakis and loose sweaters that we wore in the 80’s," he said.When it comes to home interiors, Wood also noted the breezy new Lily Pulitzer fabric collection forLee Jofa, saying he is particularly taken with the great patterns, amazing colors and "sheer happiness" of the line. "It certainly represents a style that is considered to be 'classic' American", said Wood.Mixed in with the bright exuberance of the Lily Pulitzer line is the ever-classicRalph Lauren Homecollection. Ralph Lauren is the embodiment of the self-made man to whom a classic American, casual prep style came naturally, belying his Bronx upbringing. Scott Meacham Wood, who earlier in his career worked as a stylist for Ralph Lauren Home in California, enjoys the mixing of lighter and brighter fabrics with classic leathers and linens. This mixing of materials, both old and new, imbues a sense of history. A layering of art and accessories adds to the overall historical, yet still casual, feel.In the wrong hands, preppy style becomes a cliché, almost a uniform. Red trousers: check; Top Siders: check; sailboats: check, check. But these things only scratch the surface. Deckingyour homein sailboat motifs and brown leather furniture (the interiors version of the uniform) doesn’t truly capture the breezy essence of the preppy lifestyle. In addition to Ralph Lauren and Lily Pulitzer lines mentioned above, here is a list of 5 must-have items that capture the essence of the preppy home.Furnishings should be sturdy and comfortable, they should hold up to lots of use and sandy feet, and should become even more comfortable over time. Nothing should be too modern, too dark or too neon. It’s a careful yet casual mixing of ingredients, of things you love and find comfortable, that really captures the essence of a preppy lifestyle.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/preppy-style-at-homeDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Once they traveled several miles to a set net site at Olga Bay and flagged down a fisherman, who called the U.S. Coast Guard, the group returned to Stockholm Bay where the tide was coming in to recover Lounsbury’s body.Once AST was alerted to the case just after midnight Thursday, troopers traveled to Akhiok at first light to meet with the local village public safety officer. Along with the VPSO, troopers visited several Olga Bay locations to speak with witnesses as they investigated Lounsbury's death.Troopers don’t believe foul play was involved in Lounsbury’s death. His next of kin in Oregon have been notified, and his body will be sent to the state medical examiner’s office for an autopsy Friday.Contact Chris KlintCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Conifers naturally provide the bonus of evergreen color, which can serve as a backdrop or simple visual relief in a stark landscape. Conifers can be used in a number of creative ways as hedges and in rock gardens. So how do you get started planting and working with conifers?Robert Childs, of theUniversity of Massachusetts Extension Service, shares his knowledge on how best to care for conifers.Before You BuyChilds said the first thing you want to do is find a reputable nursery. Second, you want to have your soil tested. “Everybody forgets about the soil,” said Childs. “Most conifers prefer a soil that is slightly acidic,” he said. Childs said that conifers, when they do drop their needles, help to provide needed soil acidity without overwhelming the tree.Also, be sure youknow what planting zone you are in. For example, Massachusetts is a Zone 5. Conifers that would thrive on Long Island, NY (Zone 7), would not be able to tolerate the level of cold in Massachusetts. Here is a link to theUDSA Zone Map.“Every tree has its own set of needs,” said Childs. “Plant the right tree in the right place.”Childs also said that a basic rule of thumb about conifers is that most do not like wet soils. Research the type of conifer you want to plant. Childs gave the example of the salt sensitivity of White Pines. “You wouldn’t want to plant them next to a major road or the salt run-off in the winter will kill them. Whereas the Pitch Pine you’ll find on the Cape (Cape Cod) is very salt tolerant,” he said.Tips When Planting Conifers“Trees that are transplanted are under stress for up to two years. You can’t just plant them and walk away,” said Childs. Childs said that the most important factor in transplanting conifers is how the root system is cared for. “Large nurseries may be digging up tens of thousands of trees with machinery. Some trees may not come out with a healthy root system,” he said. “You want to have maximum root development. Trees loose up to 95 percent of their roots when being transplanted.”Childs said that the fall it is best time to transplant conifers. Once you have your trees ready for planting, take the burlap, wire, or bucket off of the plant and examine the roots.Plant the tree only up to the root flare.The root flare is what it sounds like, where the roots begin to flare out. Childs said that if you plant the tree above the flare, it will likely kill the tree. He added that most people expect to be able to just take the burlap or bucket off the root ball and just drop it in the ground. “Sometimes the flare ends up in the middle of that root ball,” said Childs. “Take off as much wrapping as possible and really examine what you have.”Make sure your conifers receive adequate water following planting, especiallywhen there is a drought.FertilizingChilds said that “unless its incredibly poor soil, you shouldn’t have to usepeat, compost, or manureto fertilize.” Childs recommended that only in the worst soil conditions should a fertilizer such as a 10-10-10 mix be used.What insects are conifers susceptible to, and what do I do about them?Conifers don’t tend to be especially attractive to insect infestations with a few notable exceptions. Mugo, or dwarf mountain pines, are susceptible to caterpillar infestations. Mugo pines are often used as ornamentals around rock gardens as they are low-lying. Some conifers are susceptible to pine needle scale and spider mites, and hemlocks may attract wooly adelgid, which was introduced to the northeastern US in the 1950’s.Wooly adelgid are fluid sucking insects similar to aphids. “It has weakened a lot of trees and can kill them,” said Childs. Do not fertilize with nitrogen-containing products if you have wooly adelgid, as they thrive on nitrogen.There are manypesticides approved for homeowner use, some of which are earth-friendly such as horticultural oils and insecticide soaps. However, you may want to call in a professional if the problem gets out of hand. You also may need to take out any diseased/infested trees so that any others around them have a better chance for survival.What about pruning?Due to the fact that the conifers you are transplanting have been stressed by the process, you don’t want to do any heavy pruning initially said Childs. “You shouldn’t prune at planting unless you have broken or damaged limbs,” said Childs. “The foliage and roots ‘talk’ to each other via hormones.” He said the communication process that goes between roots and foliage on lets the tree know it needs more water or certain types of nourishment.Now you have the basics on conifer care.  Again, it is best to talk with people at local nurseries tofind additional informationregarding which conifers will work best in your location.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/caring-for-conifersNo email address was supplied by.

Prior to commanding the 1st District, Abel supervised the Coast Guard’s “Rescue 21” project to improve its system for receiving and responding to distress calls, as well as commanding Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., the Coast Guard’s third-largest base.Abel replaces Rear Adm. Thomas Ostebo, who reached flag rank in July 2008 and has headed the Juneau-based 17th District since May 2011. In addition todiscussing the Coast Guard’s role in U.S. Arctic strategy,he was also a key player inMay 2013 hearings on the Shell drilling unit Kulluk's groundingon New Year’s Eve in 2012. The Coast Guard has saidits report on the grounding won’t be public until early this year.“I want to take this chance to thank Tom for the incredible dedication he showed in serving our state,” Murkowski said. “Wherever he ends up, I want him to know that a grateful Alaska stands behind him.”Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

I just sampled those dense (and heavy) pies in their hometown, so I wanted to try the pizzeria’s more conventional offerings. Since I also wanted a second opinion, political reporter Austin Baird volunteered to accompany me and help down a pie.The restaurant itself occupies a corner slot along the south side of 6th Avenue, not far from Humpy’s and a block north of the Dena’ina Center. It’s easy to miss from the street, which means you’re mainly likely to stop by if you either walk by or know where it is -- that said, 6th is a high-traffic area, and depending on when you go, parking can be a chore. We found a spot with relative ease on a weekday afternoon, parking across the street from the Dena’ina and walking north to the restaurant.The façade at Flattop is dominated by large windows onto the street along both exterior walls, which lend a surprisingly airy ambience to the establishment. Two long, shallow tables lined with high chairs along the windows take advantage of the light, with several pool tables and the maneuvering room around them taking up the bulk of the floor space between the walls and the well-stocked bar around which the dining area is built. A few normal tables and chairs are tucked away into the room’s corners, for those who want to keep their feet on the floor.A one-page menu is almost puritanical in its focus on pizza, with a quartet each of appetizers, salads and desserts the only distraction to be found from Flattop’s signature dish. Nearly a dozen custom pies, including the pizzeria’s own take on deep dish, adorn the menu alongside build-your-own selections drawing from an ingredient list which includes seven kinds of cheese alone. Rather than hazard assembling something from scratch Austin and I placed ourselves in the hands of the professionals, ordering a large pizza ($19) split half-and-half between two of the recipes, Anchortown and Powerline Pass. While the menu warns to allow half an hour for deep-dish pizzas, our standard-crust order was brought to the table in about 20 minutes.The first slice I tried was of the Anchortown, a white-sauce chicken pizza heavy on the vegetables. Cilantro, red onions and the pie’s garlic-ranch sauce drove much of its flavor, playing well against the calmer base of grilled chicken, mozzarella-cheddar cheese blend, and diced Roma tomatoes. It’s a fairly dense pile of items for a chicken pizza, and it felt markedly more substantial than similar recipes I’ve sampled. Austin, a fellow white-pizza fan, was of a similar opinion but compared it to red-sauce pizzas rather than its own breed: “Definitely it was good, it was light -- lighter for pizza.”I soon found out why Austin’s praise was so faint, though, when I took a slice of the Powerline Pass out of the pan. Easily the most ruthlessly carnivorous item on the menu, it begins with a simple marinara-mozzarella base upon which it serves up no fewer than six flavors of meat: flat cuts of Canadian bacon, salami and pepperoni, neatly layered beneath a sprinkled coating of hamburger, house sausage and bacon. While I took a bite with some trepidation, given a deep-dish slice in Chicago that simply piled toppings on for their own sake, I soon reached for a second piece -- the Powerline’s flavors are almost artfully balanced, its richness countered by just-right amounts of each meat. The pie’s strongest single flavor was the marinara, which almost stole the show: chunky with tomato pieces and an aggressive hint of spice, the sauce beneath it all nearly rivaled a good salsa for power and freshness.While Flattop certainly fits into a specific niche, implicitly declared by its menu -- if you’re not in the mood for pizza, you should wait until you are -- it offers a very fresh take on a food that’s nearly become a commodity in Anchorage. Austin declared the pizza “better than Moose’s Tooth,” a bold claim I’m not quite ready to make, but the elements are definitely there to make it happen. I’ll be visiting again in the future, to give that deep-dish pie the try it deserves on an empty stomach.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

The incident occurred several blocks from Humpy’s but it’s still disturbing for General Manager Pete Burns."People come in sometimes, and they're shaking their head on things that they see going on in the streets outside,” Burns said. “Whether it’s pan-handlers people asking for money, people camped out at city hall, teenagers in the park strip getting into fights that spill over into this area.”Burns is happy the Anchorage Police Department has added eight extra officers to midnight patrol shifts on Friday and Saturday nights. The officers are being moved from other beats where they weren’t needed."This kind of behavior is getting to be a little too much, a little too extreme, and that we would all like to be able to enjoy downtown Anchorage, anytime in any area of downtown freely,” said APD Spokeswoman Jennifer Castro.The patrols will only last through the end of the year, so downtown leaders are trying to come up with long term solutions to prevent violent incidents from happening.“Things like improving the lighting in and around your business and on city streets, to longer term goals like increasing the residential component of downtown,” said Chris Schutte of the Downtown Partnership.Burns is worried about crime in general and how it affects Anchorage’s image.“Bar break issues happen everywhere, the biggest issue that I see is that people don't come; this is Anchorage, this is a great city,” Burns said. “This is my home now; I've been here 19 years."APD says no extra money is being used to pay for the increased patrols.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

"It could be a rape, it could be an act of domestic violence, a kick, words that hurt."AWAIC has partnered with the Anchorage Police Department, Alaska State Troopers, Standing Together Against Rape, and the Alaska Native Justice Center to be proactive in violence prevention."Sometimes (it's) just your presence, if people know if they are being observed," said Emmal. "I've heard people give examples of just pulling out their cell phone and making it pretty clear, 'Hey, I'm recording this.'"At businesses including Humpy's Great Alaskan Alehouse on 6th Avenue, employees are getting free training from Green Dot Alaska on how to respond to violence. As part of Humpy's recent pub quiz night, staff introduced Green Dot concepts to patrons."Nothing is going to change unless you do something, so if you see something speak up," said Pete Burns, Humpy's general manager. "Having 270 to 280 people that walk out with a little bit more idea of what's going on around them, being aware of social situations and occurrences that take place is definitely going to help things out."Backers say knowledge is power, especially in a state that ranks amongst the highest in the nation in sexual and domestic assaults."This is Anchorage, its a pretty inclusive community where everyone is pretty open to everyone's ideas and beliefs and take care of each other -- we have to on a daily basis," Burns said.In addition to Humpy's, businesses like Snow City Café and Checker Cab are scheduled to get Green Dot Alaska training to respond to violent situations.

Shortly thereafter, Penn's Alek Torgersen was intercepted by Brandon Roe to seal a loss for the Quakers (0-1) in their season opener.Bell finished 20-of-39 for 239 yards while Bryant sparked the Dolphins with 127 rushing yards in addition to four catches for 33 yards and a score. Torgersen was harassed into a 14-of-33 performance for 200 yards with one TD and two interceptions, and he also led Penn with 65 rushing yards and a score.The Quakers scored two third-quarter touchdowns to turn a 19-17 deficit into a 12-point advantage. The Dolphins got closer on Bell's 7-yard scoring strike to Bryant with 6:18 left before pulling ahead on the TD pass to Randle. Penn originally led 17-3 midway through the second quarter before Jacksonville scored the next 16 points, including two touchdown passes by Bell. One of those scores went to Andy Robustelli, who led the Dolphins with 51 receiving yards - the second-highest total in the game behind Spencer Kulcsar, who totaled 110 yards on three receptions for the Quakers.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

St. Louis was idle on Thursday.Volquez struck out 10 and walked one while improving his record to 13-7 and lowering his ERA to 3.04. The 31-year-old native of the Dominican Republic even had a base hit, breaking a 0-for-45 streak.Volquez, who signed for $5 million as a free agent after posting a 5.71 ERA last season with San Diego and the Los Angeles Dodgers, is 5-0 with a 1.36 ERA in his past 10 starts.Harrison, who has a 13-game hitting streak, raised his average to .319 -- just ahead of the .317 mark by Colorado first baseman Justin Morneau.Right fielder Travis Snider was 3-for-3 with a home run, second baseman Neil Walker smacked his 22nd homer and the Pirates had seven of their 16 hits go for extra bases. Center fielder Andrew McCutchen had three RBIs.The loss assured the Braves (77-82) of a losing season after they won 96 games last year and 94 in 2012. They are a dismal 5-17 in September and just avoided their seventh shutout of the month with a run in the ninth inning.The Pirates got three hits out of their first basemen. Gabby Sanchez had an RBI single as a pinch hitter against left-handed reliever Luis Avilan in the sixth inning after Ike Davis had two doubles in as many trips to the plate.Pittsburgh added three more runs against Avilan in the seventh, left fielder Starling Marte capping the inning with a two-run double. Then the Pirates scored four times in the eighth off reliever Gus Schlosser, with Walker hitting a two-run blast.David Hale, making his first start for the Braves since June 28 as a replacement for Mike Minor, made it through 4 2/3 innings on 92 pitches and allowed five hits and two runs. The rookie right-hander struck out four and walked four, two intentionally.Hale made five previous starts this season and 39 bullpen appearances, posting a 3.27 ERA. He worked three innings in relief of Minor (shoulder inflammation) last Saturday.Snider gave the Pirates a quick lead, connecting with a 1-2 curveball and sending a drive into seats behind the fence in right-center field for his 13th homer of the season.Pirates third baseman Josh Harrison extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single leading off the third inning and raced home on center fielder Andrew McCutchen's short sacrifice fly to make to 2-0.Volquez struck out the side in the first inning on 12 pitches, then fanned left fielder Justin Upton on just three more to start the second. The Braves were hitless until third baseman Phil Gosselin led off the fourth with an infield single, and Volquez had his sixth and seventh strikeouts before the inning was over.NOTES: RHP Vance Worley (8-4) is scheduled to start for the Pirates on Friday night in Cincinnati, with LHP Francisco Liriano (7-10) and RHP Gerrit Cole (11-5) tentatively to follow against the Reds. ... RHP Charlie Morton, who had pitched just once for the Pirates since mid-August, was placed on the 60-day disabled list with a sports hernia that will likely require surgery. He was 6-12 with a 3.72 ERA in 25 starts. ... RHP Chaz Roe, a reliever, was claimed by the Pirates off waivers from the New York Yankees. ... 3B Chris Johnson was out of the Braves lineup after suffering a lower back strain the previous night. ... Braves C Evan Gattis, weakened by a bout with strep throat and kidney stones, caught his first game since Sept. 7. ... The Braves finish the season with three games in Philadelphia.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

I was showing the students an example of a travel article, one I had written for The New York Times about Plymouth, Massachusetts.I read a few paragraphs from the opening scene, with U.S. 44 winding through cranberry bogs, a billboard coming into view with images of Gov. William Bradford and Elder Brewster, the greeting in boldface letters: Welcome to Plymouth -- America's Hometown, and a black Pilgrim hat that conjured up memories of all those Thanksgiving pageants in grade school when Priscilla said: "Speak for yourself, John."A student in the second row said, "Who's John? And ... this Priscilla?"A student in front of her said, "I've never heard of these people."That's when a young woman in the front row said, "Yeah, I kept wondering, who are these dudes?"I felt sheer incredulity now. "Capt. Myles Standish?!"The no was in the silence.A silence that morphed into sympathy. They hadn't meant to make me feel so bad.A student at the other end of the second row squinted in deep thought, admitting that Myles Standish sort of rang a bell. "Wasn't he the captain of the ship?"I didn't know you could get through grade school without those Thanksgiving pageants and the Priscilla-John Alden-Myles Standish triangle immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Nor did I think you could get through the American history courses that follow or become a student at one of the top public universities in the land without encountering those names. Or Gov. William Bradford. Or Elder Brewster.Publishers of textbooks have pretty much dropped the Pilgrims. Maybe they are sensitive to separation of church and state, or don't want to jeopardize their sales to schools and school boards. It's true, too, that lots of more recent history has had to be added to textbooks, for World War II and the Cold War, not to mention Vietnam, the space race, the civil rights movement and the too many assassinations and assassination attempts. That leaves little or no room for the Pilgrims and what they did.But I say no more.No more forgetting, casting Priscilla and John Alden, Capt. Myles Standish, Bradford and Elder Brewster aside -- left in the ditch of history.Let's hear it for the Pilgrims!I say this not for personal reasons -- I am a member of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants -- but because their story is an important part of this country's history.When they boarded the Mayflower in Plymouth, England, in 1620, it was not because they didn't have anything better to do.They did not sail across the Atlantic, still a great unknown, simply to see what was on the other side.They came aboard the ship -- a very small ship for such a big ocean, all the more evident if you have stepped aboard the replica Mayflower II -- and sailed west because they had a deep and abiding desire to worship their God as they saw fit.There were 102 of them.The Pilgrims did not occupy passenger cabins, however small those cabins might have been back then. They were considered the cargo for the voyage, and so crossed in the cargo space, the deck -- a dark deck -- below the crew's quarters.Halfway across, the ship was damaged by a bad storm. In another storm, John Howland was swept off the deck of the ship into the ocean; he managed to grab a rope and was pulled back on deck.Oceanus Hopkins was born at sea. Peregrine White was born after they reached Cape Cod.The Mayflower dropped anchor in Provincetown Harbor on November 22, 1620. (Some historians give the date as November 11.)Later that day 41 men gathered in a cabin to draw up the rules of governance for their colony -- a document that has come to be known as the Mayflower Compact. Those 41 men then affixed their signatures to one of the great liberty documents of history. It would become the keystone for the U.S. Constitution.No email address was supplied by.

According to the Associated Press, KYUK reports that Cooke’s family says the body is thought to be his.“Troopers responded to the scene to collect the remains and investigate,” troopers wrote. “The remains are believed to be a man that was the subject of a search and rescue (effort) beginning (Oct. 25).”Cooke and Napoka had been reported overdueafter leaving Tuluksak for Napaskiak Oct. 22. In a cellphone call, Napoka told his family he and Cooke would make it to Tuntutuliak the next day. They never arrived, however, and a subsequent search found a sunken skiff near the mouth of the Kialik that matched a description of Napoka’s boat.AST spokesperson Megan Peters confirmed that the tentative ID means troopers believe the body is that of either Cooke or Napoka. She wouldn’t confirm which, though, pending further information.“An ID was found with the body, but we’re waiting for a positive ID from the (state medical examiner) before we release the name,” Peters said.Troopers say next of kin have been alerted to the discovery.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Its currently neighboring eateries include Campobello and a Domino’s Pizza kitchen, with a variety of other businesses also tucked into the same building – the restaurant can be a bit hard to find from the street, with the parking lot a little tight to navigate but usually offering a spot without too much trouble behind the wheel.When I walked into Larry’s on a late-afternoon visit I found the place subdued but still occupied by half a dozen diners, a respectable haul for the hour in a fairly restaurant-dense section of Midtown. A wall of potted plants separates the dining area on the right side of the room from a bar/service area on the left that wasn’t in use during my visit, with the kitchen in back and relatively open for diners to watch chefs at work. Most of the décor is dark and relaxed, giving the restaurant a low-key feel which I appreciated after the hustle and bustle of a busy morning at the station.The menu at Larry’s spans a wide swath of Asian cuisine, from standards like bulgogi to specialties such as a five-spice duck and localized entrees like miso halibut. Much of the more exotic fare appears only on the full-price dinner menu, however, and I opted to order from the lunch special available until 3 p.m. -- while most of the items on offer were relatively simple, a chicken green curry pot pie ($15) caught my eye, and I quickly ordered it. While I waited for the food, I was served a small green salad unbilled as part of the entrée; it was a simple but tasty blend of romaine and grape tomatoes anointed with a tangy peanut-based dressing, a simple touch which distracted me quite nicely from the 20-minute wait for the pie.The pot pie actually turned out to be a deep bowl of chicken curry, topped with a massive piece of puff pastry atop the bowl and served alongside a small but dense mound of white rice. I set the pastry aside to discover a light but surprisingly spicy broth filled with cilantro, carrots, yellow peppers and peas, alongside thin-sliced but generous pieces of flat chicken breast; the pastry was delicious as well, reminiscent of an oversized croissant and providing a counterpoint to the curry proper. The dish only came into its own, however, when I took a piece of the pastry and immersed it in the curry, where it promptly soaked up all of the flavors from the broth and became something more than the sum of its parts, more like true pot-pie filling and insanely good. The pastry only took up about half of the broth, which didn't make sense until I dumped the rice in and transformed the curry once again, this time into a comfort-food soup that I didn't leave a drop of behind.Larry's might not be the most high-profile restaurant in Midtown, but behind its unassuming banner lies a fine lunch, well-prepared and memorable for offering an inspired take on Asian food.  The prices are a bit above the unofficial $10 average for an Anchorage lunch, but I think it's a worthy upgrade  -- while I wouldn't presume to speak for every diner, I walked in tired of the rain with the troubles of several pending stories still on my mind, but when I emerged from the Cocoon I felt like I was ready to fly.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Much of the gear is underneath the whale, so it is challenging to access both visually and physically,” said NOAA’s lead for the Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Network Aleria Jensen in a written statement. "We are now discussing the best course of action forward and gathering additional resources.”The team is waiting for calm seas later in the week to launch another response. It is hoped the extra time will also allow the whale to relax so that it might be more approachable.“The animals don't always understand that you are there to help them,” said Ed Lyman, NOAA's West Coast Entanglement Response Coordinator in a written statement. “This animal has been distressed and markedly evasive, so we are also giving it some space and time in hopes that it will calm down before we take additional action.”NOAA officials have stated the whale has been fitted with several red polyballs in an effort to lift the whale in order for crews to free the tethered material inhibiting the whale.According to officials, the whale appears to be able to breathe and does not appear to be in anymore immediate danger.Email Joshua StaabFacebookTwitterCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

For those concerned about the mine, it’s action they’ve been waiting years for, but others say the Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to preemptively veto the project.On Tuesday, the EPA began the first of seven public hearings in Alaska, something the EPA says will help determine if it should move forward with restrictions of withdraw them. Residents in Anchorage had the chance to voice their concerns and opinions at the Egan Center.The hearings came after the EPA invoked a section of the Clean Water Act called 404 C. It allows the agency to prohibit or restrict the discharge of dredged or fill material if a project could have adverse effects on fishery areas.According to the EPA, three years of science shows the Pebble Mine poses significant risks to the Bristol Bay watershed. The Pebble Partnership says the decision to veto the project comes before it has filed for a permit is based on incomplete information, and for that reason calls the move unprecedented.“EPA has never preemptively stopped a project in the 42 year history of the Clean Water Act,” said Mike Heatwole, Pebble Limited Partnership. “And the precedent that would be established outside of the permitting process is of grave concern, not just to Pebble, but all of the state-wide trade and business associations, and many national organizations.”The EPA says it’s used Section 404C of the Clean Water Act only 13 times before, and its decision is based on an environmental assessment that shows the stream and wetland loss would be unprecedented in the nation.“What we have here is an extraordinarily large mine in an extraordinarily important fisher location,” said Dennis McLerran, Regional Administrator for EPA Region 10. “So this is an extraordinary use of authority that we use very infrequently very sparingly but we use it when it’s really important.”There is no set time for the hearing to wrap up; each person was given two minutes to speak after signing up.

Miami has won two in a row after a two-game skid.Deng surpassed his previous best scoring output in a Miami uniform by 12 points and reached the 30-point plateau for the first time since Dec. 2, 2013, when he was with Chicago. The veteran small forward, signed in the offseason to help offset the loss of LeBron James, made 13 of 19 shots from the floor, including four of nine 3-point attempts.Heat guard Dwyane Wade and center Chris Bosh both notched 20-10 double-doubles. Wade had 20 points and 10 assists, and Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in his hometown. Miami guard Mario Chalmers scored 18 off the bench.Dallas guard Monta Ellis scored a team-high 23, with center Tyson Chandler netting his third double-double of the season with 16 points and 15 boards. Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki finished with 17 points, 16 coming in the first half.The Mavericks cut into an 11-point halftime deficit with a strong start to the third quarter, reversing a trend of poor play coming out of halftime this season. Ellis carried the load, as Dallas used an 11-2 run to cut Miami's lead to 63-59.Miami regained control with a 9-0 run and carried an 83-67 lead into the fourth quarter. The Mavericks (4-3) didn't make a dent in the final quarter while suffering their first home loss in three games.Deng's shooting helped stake the Heat to an early lead. Miami finished the first quarter with an 11-0 run, punctuated by a 3-point from Deng for a 29-20 lead at the end of the period.Bosh picked it up for the visitors in the second quarter, as the lead reached double digits. Miami shot 60 percent for a 55-44 lead at halftime, with 15 points each from Bosh and Deng.The Mavericks looked frustrated, especially defensively, throughout the half as the Heat continued to get open looks. Offensively, they weren't much better, shooting just 37 percent, including just 3-for-15 from beyond the arc.Mavericks forward Chandler Parsons missed all six of his shots in 15 first-half minutes, and was 1-for-9 for the game. He is only 2-for-20 shooting in the last two games while dealing with the effects of an upper respiratory infection.NOTES: Mavericks owner Mark Cuban raised the question before the game of Oklahoma City sitting F Kevin Durant and G Russell Westbrook for the rest of the season to possibly secure a high draft pick. The absence of the Thunder stars has led to the team's 1-5 start. "I'm not suggesting anything," Cuban said. "I'm just curious why the question hasn't been asked because I'm curious what the answer is." ... Miami F Chris Bosh came into the game as one of only three players in the league averaging at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per game. ... Dallas F Dirk Nowitzki went into Sunday needing 34 points to surpass Hall-of-Fame C Hakeem Olajuwon for ninth on the NBA's all-time scoring list. "Everybody better enjoy watching Dirk Nowitzki while he's still playing, because there's not going to be another one like him ever," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said.

Miami has won two in a row on back-to-back nights after a two-game skid."It's good for us and good for the team," Heat center Chris Bosh said. "I am just proud of the way we played and the way we did it with defense and sharing the ball. This is a very tough team, especially on the road. That is one of the things we feel like we can make a lot of improvement on."I am proud of our guys. We had a bunch of guys that stepped up. Mario Chalmers and Luol Deng had fantastic games tonight, and you never know where it's going to come from."Deng surpassed his previous best scoring output in a Miami uniform by 12 points and reached the 30-point plateau for the first time since Dec. 2, 2013, when he was with Chicago."We want everyone to feel they are in a rhythm and if the ball is moving, everybody can have a chance to be aggressive but also be in rhythm," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "It might be a different guy on different nights. You don't have to hunt for 30 points from any one guy, but (Deng) is one of our primary attackers and scorers and he does need to get his opportunities, and we have to work to help him get comfortable."He was terrific tonight on the road and hit the big ones when we needed them."The veteran small forward, signed in the offseason to help offset the loss of James, made 13 of 19 shots from the floor, including four of nine 3-point attempts. Deng was critical in Miami getting off to a strong start."He played hard," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. "He did everything hard. He cut hard, he drove hard and he was terrific.

While the parking lot isn’t big, signs at both restaurants have seemingly educated drivers in the overflowing parking lot at the Moose’s Tooth that they’ll be towed if they park at Kinley’s; despite what looked like a capacity lunch crowd next door during my visit with Jeff, I had no problem finding a space.Like many of Anchorage’s finer restaurants, Kinley’s has turned much of its attention inward rather than outward, focusing on the dining area where customers spend their visit. Four small tables with chairs before the front desk create a small but useful waiting area, with the dining area beyond wrapped around an elegant and unobtrusive bar. Most of the seating is in booths lining the edge of the building, with long low windows letting in plenty of natural light, but there are some tables slightly inward from them. Some of the booths have bolted-down tables that can be a little tight for bigger guys like myself, so we moved from one of the former to one of the latter.For lunch, Kinley’s fields its full selection of about a dozen appetizers alongside a core menu of about half a dozen each salads, sandwiches and entrees -- the sandwiches are largely omitted from the entree-heavy dinner menu, making many of them lunch exclusives. With the restaurant specializing in seafood, Jeff quickly cottoned on to ordering a halibut BLT ($18); I was intrigued by the description of a tenderloin burger ($16), opting to add a side of house-specialty French onion soup ($5) perhaps due to this week’s rainy weather. With our orders taken, our waiter brought out a basket of four warm white and wheat bread slices meant to go with the olive oil on the table, but upstaged by the incredibly fresh butter which accompanied it. With the lunch crowd relatively modest we broke the bread and talked shop for about 15 minutes, which was all the kitchen need to put down a pair of intimidating plates before us.Jeff, not normally a heavy eater, was hungry and tore into the BLT with gusto. Essentially a variant of a focaccia BLT also on the menu enhanced with caper aioli and a cut of halibut, Jeff had great praise for it after only a few bites: “Not overwhelmingly fishy or anything, got good seasoning on it -- I can’t cook halibut this good.” While he often makes his own halibut, the meal was his first sampling of the dish in sandwich form and he liked it: “Delicious: halibut's cooked just right, the bacon just totally compliments the halibut as well.” Despite arriving cut in half as two tall stacks of meat and bread, Rivet was rather stunned to have “just wolfed this thing in one sitting,” only stopping halfway through the accompanying pile of beer-battered fries which he admitted from the outset were his favorite kind.Calling the tenderloin burger I was served a burger may be technically accurate, but only in the same way that calling a Ferrari Enzo a car is. Composed not of standard hamburger meat but ground filet mignon, even from the outset it was in its own league; it shared many of the same trimmings with Jeff’s sandwich -- generous quantities of lettuce, tomato, red onion and bacon -- then topped it off with a thick slice of Muenster cheese. Capping off the dripping-wet, gloriously tasty results, a house-made smoked Porter steak sauce landed somewhere between A-1 and ketchup, combining the best parts of both with a richness that I’ve rarely encountered in a condiment before. All things considered, it’s the single best beef sandwich of any kind that I’ve had in Anchorage, and a must-try if you have the opportunity; the only demerit it even has is the hot mess to which its final bites inevitably devolve, but that’s easily rectified by keeping it over the plate.Despite the burger being markedly larger than I’d anticipated, I didn’t have any trouble whatsoever digging into the French onion soup. Served in a custom oven-baked bowl, my delay in eating it let the customary disc of French bread and cheese atop it fuse into a sticky, onion-drenched delicacy which had cooled just enough not to burn my tongue when I started to eat it. The five-dollar charge was well worth it despite cheaper options (substituting soup du jour or a salad is only $2), as a spoonful of soup brought up a blend of broth and onions that didn’t readily slide off due to its latent thickness. While all French onion soups have salt, the true test of the dish is whether it’s a noticeable additional flavor, and the savory sweetness of the onions carried the day so completely that it didn’t even register in the last drop of it I ate.Kinley’s is definitely a treat, and like any treat you shouldn’t overindulge -- eating food this good every day would leave anyone inured to its sheer excellence. There’s definitely a premium in play for the quality and quantity of what you get in the easily underestimated portions, but we ordered on the high side of the menu and most lunch items come in at $12, which is in line with the loose constant of about $10 a plate I’ve seen across town. The next time you can’t find a space at the Moose’s Tooth and the line stretches out the door, consider crossing the street and spending an hour eating rather than waiting -- instead of being towed, you might be wowed.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

The 24-year-old netted three goals in 25 contests last campaign.ABOUT THE CANUCKS (11-5-0): Bonino has done everything he can to win the hearts of Canucks fans since being acquired from Anaheim for fan-favorite Ryan Kesler during the offseason. The 26-year-old has collected 13 points in 16 games while developing a knack for scoring the big goal. Three of Bonino's seven tallies have been game-winners, giving him a share of the league lead in that category, while he also netted the deciding shootout goal on Sunday.OVERTIME1. The clubs are meeting for the first time since the Senators posted a 4-2 victory in the 2014 NHL Heritage Classic at BC Place in Vancouver on March 2.2. Turris' goal on Sunday was his first since the season opener, ending his 12-game drought. 3. Bonino is tied with Pittsburgh's Chris Kunitz, Carolina's Elias Lindholm and Clarke MacArthur of the Senators for first in game-winning tallies.PREDICTION: Canucks 3, Senators 1Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Los Angeles has gone 2-0-2 over its last four contests, including a 6-5 shootout loss at Anaheim on Wednesday in which it held three two-goal leads. The Kings have scored five goals in each of their last two games after netting three or fewer in their previous six.The Stars are coming off their first win in eight games, a 4-3 triumph at Arizona that saw them overcome a two-goal deficit. Tyler Seguin scored twice in a 57-second span late in the second period to forge a tie and Ryan Garbutt netted a short-handed goal with 1:16 remaining in the third to give Dallas its first victory since Oct. 24 at New Jersey. The multi-goal performance was the second in a row and third of the season for Seguin, who shares the league lead in tallies (12) with Rick Nash of the New York Rangers.TV: 10:30 p.m. ET, FSN Southwest Plus (Dallas), FSN West (Los Angeles)ABOUT THE STARS (5-6-4): Travis Moen could make his debut for Dallas after being acquired from Montreal on Tuesday for defenseman Sergei Gonchar. The 32-year-old Moen, who had appeared in 690 games with Chicago, Anaheim, San Jose and Montreal, failed to register a point in 10 contests with the Canadiens this season. Defenseman John Klingberg made his NHL debut Tuesday, recording one blocked shot and a plus-1 rating while logging 18:32 of ice time.ABOUT THE KINGS (8-4-4): Martin Jones could make his third start of the season after Jonathan Quick faced a season-high 49 shots in Wednesday's shootout loss. The 28-year-old Quick has seen 40 or more shots five times this campaign, including a 43-save shutout on Oct. 16 against St. Louis. Defenseman Jamie McBain made his debut for Los Angeles on Wednesday, recording one of the team's 20 blocked shots while finishing with a minus-1 rating in 11:47 of ice time.OVERTIME1. Los Angeles is 7-0-1 at home since losing its season opener against San Jose.2. Dallas LW Erik Cole's next point will be the 500th of his career.3. The Kings posted a 3-1 victory at Dallas on Nov. 4, with Trevor Lewis scoring a short-handed goal and adding an assist.PREDICTION: Kings 4, Stars 3Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Pacif...<COL>Losing seven of their last nine games provides ample motivation for the Los Angeles Kings, who also will have revenge on their minds when they host the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday afternoon in the second matchup in four days between the Pacific Division rivals. The Kings blew two-goal leads on three occasions before falling at Anaheim in a shootout Wednesday in this season's first installment of the Freeway Faceoff. Los Angeles was blanked by Dallas 24 hours later for its first regulation home loss since the season opener.The Ducks had dropped three in a row - all at home and each beyond regulation - prior to the comeback victory over the Kings, a stretch during which leading goal-scorer Corey Perry has been sidelined due to the mumps. Perry, who was leading the league with 11 goals prior to becoming ill, was back on the ice for the first time at Thursday's practice but may not be ready to return to the lineup. "The body's a little weak," Perry acknowledged. "Not ruling out this weekend, but you never know."4 p.m. ET, Prime Ticket (Anaheim), FSN West (Los Angeles)ABOUT THE DUCKS (11-3-3): Ryan Kesler was acquired from Vancouver in the offseason to be a difference-maker, and he made a huge impact in Wednesday's matchup, ending a nine-game goalless drought by scoring twice before netting the decisive tally in the shootout. "It was intense and fun," said Kesler, who extended his point streak to four games. "It was two good teams going against each other. It kind of had the same feeling as the Kings-Canucks rivalry." Veteran defenseman Francois Beauchemin will sit out his third consecutive game since also being diagnosed with the mumps while forward Dany Heatley (groin) was placed on injured reserve Friday.ABOUT THE KINGS (8-5-4): Los Angeles suffered a blow to its already thin blue-line corps as defenseman Alec Martinez underwent surgery on his finger Friday and will be sidelined indefinitely. With Slava Voynov still serving a suspension and the Kings lacking space under the salary cap to bring in another body, the hope is that Robyn Regehr will return to the lineup Saturday after sitting out the last three games with an undisclosed injury. Tanner Pearson, who is tied with Tyler Toffoli for the team's goal-scoring lead, netted all seven tallies in his first eight games but has managed only one assist over the last nine contests.OVERTIME1. Anaheim, which lost its second-round playoff series with Los Angeles in seven games last postseason, has won the last five regular-season matchups.2. Kings G Jonathan Quick, who made 44 saves Wednesday, is 6-1-1 at home this season.3. Ducks G Frederik Andersen was yanked in the second period Wednesday but takes a 3-0-0 mark against the Kings into Saturday's matchup.PREDICTION: Kings 4, Ducks 2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

On fourth down, Joe Flacco's pass for Kamar Aiken fell incomplete."That was a big stand, obviously, with the game and the way it ended," defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said. "They had had a pretty long drive there, and I was kind of surprised they went for it, but they did. And we came up on the good end of it."It gave us confidence," Guenther added. "We got off to a pretty good start, and then after that that helped our guys out."The Bengals came into the game ranked 31st in the NFL in defense, and they allowed the Ravens to go 89 yards on their first series. But after the 18-play drive ended with no points, the defense allowed just 205 yards the rest of the way.The 294 yards were the fewest the team has surrendered all season, as was the 43.1 passer rating."We needed that a lot," linebacker Vontaze Burfict said.NOTES: For the second time in three games, WR Mohamed Sanu posted a career high in receiving yards, netting 125 on five catches against Baltimore. Sanu's 538 receiving yards are a career high. ... DT Geno Atkins had a season-high four tackles and recorded his first full sack and forced fumble of the season. ... WR A.J. Green (toe) said he is 80 percent healthy and expects to play this week against Jacksonville.REPORT CARD VS. RAVENS--PASSING OFFENSE: B-plus -- Andy Dalton completed 75 percent of his passes (21 of 28) for 266 yards without much help from a running game that struggled to keep the Baltimore defense honest. Dalton was 16 of 21 for 175 yards and a 113.7 passer rating when pressured, and an impressive 6 of 9 for 151 yards and a 109.7 rating when he was blitzed--RUSHING OFFENSE: C-plus -- Running backs Giovani Bernard and Jeremy Hill combined for just 70 yards on 26 carries (2.7 average) and their longest run was eight yards. But the offensive line created space when it had to in the red zone, with all three of the team's touchdowns coming on 1-yard runs.--PASS DEFENSE: A -- The Bengals held Joe Flacco to a 43.1 passer rating, his lowest since 2011. But the 80-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Steve Smith in the final seconds that was wiped out by an offensive pass interference call would have boosted Flacco's rating -- and docked this grade -- dramatically.--RUSH DEFENSE: B-plus -- Grading on the merits of the game alone, the mark might have been a little lower. But when you look at it through a wider lens, it becomes more impressive as the Bengals allowed 101 yards after averaging 171.8 in their last four games.--SPECIAL TEAMS: A -- Punter Kevin Huber had big kicks out of his own end zone early and against an 11-man rush late. Kicker Mike Nugent was perfect on his two field goal tries and Adam Jones averaged 31 yards on three kick returns.--COACHING: B-plus -- Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther deserves a lot of credit for rallying a group that had been awful the last three games. His defense held the NFL's No. 7 offense to 294 yards while forcing two turnovers and keeping decent pressure on Joe Flacco all game.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Brian Elliott turned aside 25 shots in posting his fourth straight win over Dallas.Tyler Seguin and defenseman Trevor Daley each notched a goal and an assist while blue-liner Jamie Oleksiak netted his first career tally for the Stars, who had their three-game winning streak versus the Blues come to an end. Kari Lehtonen finished with 23 saves for Dallas, which has allowed 22 goals over its last five games.St. Louis fell behind twice but responded in quick fashion both times. Tarasenko beat Lehtonen high to the stick side from the top of the slot at 13:45 of the first period, just 35 seconds after Oleksiak's blast from the right point deflected off Patrik Berglund's stick sailed past Elliott.Seguin scored from the right faceoff dot off a feed from the corner by Jason Spezza at 5:28 of the second, but Lehtera evened it 37 seconds later as his backhander from the inner edge of the right circle glanced off Stars defenseman Jordie Benn's stick and beat Elliott.

Both look to continue their strong play when the Los Angeles Kings pay a visit to Joe Louis Arena on Friday. Datsyuk, who scored a goal and set up another in Detroit's 4-2 victory over Washington on Wednesday, has collected two tallies and three assists during his four-game point streak.The Red Wings improved to 4-1-1 in their last six contests and look to keep the good times going against a Kings club that they swept in last season's two-game series. Los Angeles saw its eight-game point streak come to a halt with a 3-0 setback to Pittsburgh on Thursday. The blanking was the first suffered by the Kings since a 4-0 season-opening loss to San Jose on Oct. 8.TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, RSN, TVA2, Prime Ticket (Los Angeles), FSN DetroitABOUT THE KINGS (6-2-2): Jarret Stoll vented some frustration after his team dropped its second straight contest following a six-game winning streak. "Two losses in a row, that's enough. We can't have that," Stoll said. "It's unacceptable for our standards, obviously. We've got to come out and get (ticked) off (Friday)." Los Angeles' special teams have left a bit to be desired during the skid, going 0-for-6 on the power play while yielding two tallies while short-handed versus the Penguins.ABOUT THE RED WINGS (5-2-2): Justin Abdelkader scored twice on Wednesday, and his line that includes captain Henrik Zetterberg and Gustav Nyquist has accounted for 13 of the team's 22 goals this season. Nyquist joined Abdelkader by netting his fifth tally - and first since Oct. 17 - and Zetterberg could be in line to improve upon his team-leading 12 points on Friday. The veteran Swede, who collected a goal and an assist in Detroit's 3-2 shootout victory over Los Angeles on Jan. 18, has netted 17 tallies and set up 18 others in 38 career meetings with the Kings.OVERTIME1.

After going 0-4-1 over its first five home games, Buffalo edged Detroit 3-2 in a shootout on Sunday for its initial victory at First Niagara Center this season. Chris Stewart forged a tie with 6:52 remaining in the third period and Zemgus Girgensons scored the decisive goal in the third round of the bonus format to give the Sabres their first win in five divisional contests (1-3-1).Montreal has lost three straight (0-2-1) and four of its last five, scoring a total of six goals in that span. The Canadiens were blanked for the second time in the five-game stretch on Tuesday as they suffered a 5-0 defeat at home against Chicago. Montreal is 1-2-1 over its last four road games, with the victory coming in a shootout.TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, RSN, RDS (Montreal), MSG (Buffalo)ABOUT THE CANADIENS (8-4-1): After beginning its home schedule by sweeping a four-game string, Montreal was outscored 11-2 in back-to-back losses to Calgary and Chicago. The club failed on four power-play opportunities Tuesday and is 0-for-17 over its last seven contests. "Nothing's working for us," said forward Tomas Plekanec, who shared the team lead in goals (five) and points (nine). "We have to stay positive as much as possible and we've got to fight through it. We've got to help ourselves somehow."ABOUT THE SABRES (3-9-1): Captain Brian Gionta remains in search of his first goal of the season as he prepares to face a Montreal team with which he spent the last five campaigns. "It always is frustrating," said the seven-time 20-goal scorer, who has just one assist in 13 contests. "When the team is losing, you want to do what you can to help - and part of that is scoring in my position. I have to do better in that aspect." Buffalo has been shut out five times this season and scored more than two goals just once, netting three in a 4-3 shootout triumph on Oct. 14 at Carolina.OVERTIME1. The Canadiens have yet to lead after one period this season and have allowed the first goal in 11 of their 13 games.2.

Pittsburgh saw its winning streak reach three games Thursday, when it posted a 3-0 triumph over Los Angeles. Chris Kunitz scored two goals and set up the other while Marc-Andre Fleury made 36 saves en route to his second shutout in six days.While the Penguins have outscored their opponents 14-3 during their current run, the Sabres have yet to hit the 14-goal mark for the season, netting a total of 12 non-shootout tallies in 11 games. Buffalo, which has scored more than two goals just once and been blanked four times, dropped a 3-2 overtime decision to Boston on Thursday. Drew Stafford and Tyler Ennis each recorded a goal and an assist as the Sabres built a 2-1 lead, but Brad Marchand scored with 5 1/2 minutes left in the third period and again 1:20 into the extra session to hand Buffalo its sixth loss in seven games (1-5-1).TV: 7 p.m. ET, RSN1, MSG (Buffalo), ROOT (Pittsburgh)ABOUT THE SABRES (2-8-1): Sam Reinhart's time in Buffalo this season is over as the team assigned the center to Kootenay of the Western Hockey League on Friday. The 18-year-old, who was drafted second overall in June, notched one assist and two penalty minutes in nine games with the Sabres. "(He's) not strong or heavy enough yet," general manager Tim Murray told the team's web site. "It's about patience. It's about doing the right thing, and I believe this is the right thing."ABOUT THE PENGUINS (6-2-1): Despite missing training camp with an undisclosed injury, Evgeni Malkin is off to quite a start this season. The former Hart Trophy winner has begun the campaign with a nine-game point streak, collecting four goals - all on the power play - and eight assists during the run. "I just do my job," said the 28-year-old Russian, who also gave credit to his linemates. "We have a great line with (Pascal Dupuis) and (Blake) Comeau. We try to use each other."OVERTIME1. Malkin set up Kunitz's first goal Thursday for his 400th career assist.2. Pittsburgh has won 11 of its last 15 meetings with Buffalo, sweeping the three-game series last season by a cumulative 12-2 score.3.

14 game...<COL>The start of November hasn't been one to remember for the New York Rangers, who have dropped three of four (1-1-2) heading into Sunday's home game against the Edmonton Oilers. While his team is sputtering, Rick Nash continued his torrid streak by tying Anaheim's Corey Perry with his 11th goal in Saturday's 5-4 road loss to Toronto. Mats Zuccarello collected a goal and an assist versus the Maple Leafs and joined Nash by scoring twice in the Rangers last meeting with the Oilers - a 5-0 rout on March 30.Edmonton secured its first road victory in six tries (1-4-1) when it skated to a 3-2 triumph over Buffalo on Friday. Boyd Gordon and Mark Arcobello each scored for the second time in as many games, with the former netting the game-winner with 4:15 remaining in the third period. "It was a big win for us," Gordon told the Edmonton Journal. "Hopefully, it can turn the road trip around for us and get us going in the right direction."TV: 6 p.m. ET, RSN West (Edmonton), MSG (New York)ABOUT THE OILERS (5-7-1): Although Iiro Pakarinen cleaned up a rebound to score his first career goal early in the second period on Friday, the rookie was more impressed with the end result. "It's great to score a goal in the best league in the world, but the most important thing is that we got two points," Pakarinen told the Edmonton Journal. While the 23-year-old Finn has just two NHL contests under his belt, captain Andrew Ference has decidedly more (842, to be exact) and is eligible to return to the lineup after serving his three-game suspension. ABOUT THE RANGERS (6-5-2): Derek Stepan recorded an assist but lost 13-of-19 faceoffs in his season debut after suffering a fractured fibula during practice on Sept. 24. Stepan has recorded at least one point in 16 of his last 24 regular-season games and is two shy of 200 for his career. Cam Talbot faced Edmonton in both meetings last season, but Henrik Lundqvist will get the call on Sunday as he looks to improve upon a 1-1-2 career mark versus the Oilers.OVERTIME1. New York LW Chris Kreider scored 53 seconds into Saturday's contest to match his career-high point streak of three games.2. Edmonton is just 1-for-22 on the power play in its last six contests.3.

The trek did not start well for San Jose, which was 20 minutes away from a 3-1 loss before scoring four times in the third period en route to a 5-3 triumph at Dallas. Defenseman Brent Burns highlighted the outburst by netting the tying and go-ahead goals in a 3:45 span.Chicago has lost three of its last four contests, including a 3-2 decision to the visiting Washington Capitals on Friday. The Blackhawks jumped out to a 2-0 lead on goals by Brandon Saad and defenseman Duncan Keith before yielding three in the final 4:57 of the second period. Chicago has dropped three straight decisions at home, all by one goal.TV: 7 p.m. ET, TVA, CSN California (San Jose), WGN (Chicago)ABOUT THE SHARKS (8-5-2): San Jose scored once on two power-play opportunities Saturday and is 6-for-17 over its last six games. Joe Thornton's empty-net goal against Dallas was his 1,206th career point, moving him past Vincent Damphousse for 44th place on the all-time list. Next up for Thornton is Bernie Nicholls, whom he trails by three points.ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS (7-6-1): Patrick Kane is off to a rough start this season, registering four goals in 14 contests. The 25-year-old, who has scored at least 21 goals in each of his seven NHL campaigns, has netted just one in his last nine contests. Coach Joel Quenneville would love to get more production from Kane now that Patrick Sharp is out for the next month with a right knee injury.OVERTIME1. Blackhawks G Corey Crawford is expected to make his fifth consecutive start Sunday.2. San Jose's win on Saturday was the eighth in franchise history in which the team trailed by two or more goals in the third period.3.

After beginning the season with an overtime loss at Tampa Bay, the Panthers were trounced in their home opener on Saturday as they dropped a 5-1 decision to New Jersey. Derek MacKenzie provided Florida's offense, converting a power-play opportunity after the club already had fallen into a 5-0 hole.Roberto Luongo had a night to forget, allowing all five goals on only 14 shots. Ottawa looks to build its first winning streak of the season after posting a 3-2 shootout triumph at Tampa Bay on Saturday. Mika Zibanejad scored the decisive goal in the third round of the bonus format as the Senators pulled even at 1-1-0 on their season-opening three-game road trip.TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, TSN5, RDS1 (Ottawa), FSN FloridaABOUT THE SENATORS (1-1-0): Ottawa has scored two goals in each of its first two games, with Kyle Turris and Alex Chiasson leading the club with two points apiece (one goal, one assist). The Senators are 1-for-8 on the power play thus far, with Chiasson netting the tally. Defenseman Erik Karlsson leads the team with seven shots on goal, one of which found its way into the net Saturday.ABOUT THE PANTHERS (0-1-1): Amazingly, Florida has given up five power-play goals on 12 opportunities and doesn't rank last in the NHL. In fact, four teams have a worse percentage than the Panthers' 58.3 mark, with Calgary and Pittsburgh also yielding a league-high five man-advantage tallies. MacKenzie's goal on Saturday is Florida's lone tally with the man advantage in 10 chances.OVERTIME1. Ottawa G Craig Anderson owns a 10-2-1 career record against Florida.2. Luongo is riding a 10-game winning streak versus the Senators.3.

Buffalo suffered its third straight loss to start the season Monday, dropping a 5-1 decision to Anaheim at home. Tyler Ennis scored the lone goal for the Sabres, who have been outshot 131-57 overall and 44-12 by the Ducks.Carolina hopes facing a team other than the New York Islanders will produce better results. The Hurricanes were swept in their season-opening home-and-home series, losing 5-3 at PNC Arena on Friday before dropping a 4-3 decision in New York the following night. Already missing injured forwards Jeff Skinner and Jordan Staal, Carolina will be without captain Eric Staal on Tuesday due to an upper-body injury.TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, NBCSNABOUT THE SABRES (0-3-0): Buffalo's offense has been woeful in the early going, registering a total of four goals in the first three games. Ennis and Zemgus Girgensons have accounted for all the tallies, netting two apiece, while Drew Stafford has assisted on three of them. The Sabres have struggled against the Hurricanes of late, losing five of the last six overall meetings and four in a row in Carolina.ABOUT THE HURRICANES (0-2-0): In addition to Eric Staal, Carolina will not have Patrick Dwyer in the lineup as the right wing is out with a lower-body injury. "We're getting hit with some injuries right now, but you play through it, and away you go," coach Bill Peters said. "That's why you have guys down in the minors that are NHL players ready to go and help you out." One such player for the Hurricanes is Zach Boychuk, who was recalled from Charlotte of the American Hockey League.OVERTIME1. Drafted 14th overall by the Hurricanes in 2008, Boychuk has registered nine goals and 15 assists in 96 NHL games with Carolina, Pittsburgh and Nashville.2. Sabres LW Marcus Foligno missed Monday's game due to an undisclosed injury, but coach Ted Nolan hopes he'll be available against the Hurricanes.3.

Heinrich cleans the table leaving the two dollar tip, all in quarters."I started here in 1979," she says.Heinrich was 16 years old when she got the job. Her starting salary was $8.25 an hour, but she loved it here and never left."I've gotten to see generations grow up," Heidi said. "Families have brought their kids here, and their kids had kids -- it has been a neat experience watching it."Later, Heidi hired 16-year-old Carolina Stacey. I asked how long she’d been with the Lucky Wishbone."Oh God; it’s going to be 20 years this December," Stacey said. "The story I tell is, my mom asked me how I liked it, and I said, 'Well, I really liked it but I'm working with a bunch of old people.' Well, now I'm one of those old people because I've worked here so long."The two women feel at home inside the restaurant that opened back in 1955. Heinrich tells stories about the trans-Alaska pipeline days, when the lines for fried chicken, burgers and milkshakes wound down the street.Pictures of both women as teenagers are on the walls. There are also photos of their kids, who grew up and got jobs at the Lucky Wishbone themselves. Heidi's daughter has been a server here for seven years."I love the atmosphere," Stacey said, "the family kind of feel. It's been wonderful."The owner of Lucky Wishbone, George Brown, still comes in twice a day. The women tell me he is one reason they stayed all these years."He's always taken very good care of the people who work here--always," Heinrich said.Until recently the menu hadn't changed for about seven years, when Brown added a halibut sandwich. Recently, Heinrich and Stacey finally got Brown to add a chef salad to the menu.Lucky Wishbone is one of those classic old-timey Anchorage restaurants, where you'll probably run into a politician having a drumstick and fries for dinner -- a place people who've left the state always come back to when they visit town.When they’re here, they always make sure to chat with Heinrich and Stacey.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

With 12 days down, the Alaska Roadtrippin’ team left Eagle bound for Delta Junction and it needed to be there with time to spare for the 5 p.m. live broadcast.The team left Eagle around 7:30 a.m. We pooled our guesses as to when we would reach Delta Junction. Marti said 3:10 p.m.; I said 3:15. Somehow Tracy nailed it on the head and guessed 3:06 p.m. I was driving and could have totally done something to avoid this outcome and I let it happen. It’s my own fault.The drive from Eagle to Delta Junction meant retracing our road as far back as Tok. We then headed north along the Alaska Highway pushing the legal speed limit. I set the cruise control and took the foot off the accelerator.We passed through a number of microclimates driving the 275 miles from the eastern borders of Alaska to a portion of the interior. It’s not uncommon, but the experience is worth noting if for no other reason than a measure of Alaska’s enormity. The mileage we drove today barely registers on Alaska’s map, but it took us nearly seven-and-a-half hours to get there. The first three hours were driving on some of Alaska’s windiest dirt roads.Driving just about anywhere in Alaska, though, one is nearly always guaranteed an entertaining trip and this one was no exception.An assortment of caribou and ptarmigans made appearances through the Eagle and Chicken areas. An occasional moose stood too long in the road from time to time.We drove along the eastern base of The Alaskan Range and experienced at least three separate climate changes along the way. From Eagle to Tok, the weather stayed warm with clear skies. From Tok the skies grew darker as we drew closer to cloud cover. By the time we reached Deltana, it was like passing through a curtain of precipitation all the way to Delta Junction. Just before reaching our destination, we again passed through the curtain, and it was dry on the other side.It’s a shame we couldn’t stay in Delta Junction longer. The same could be said for every stop we’ve made on this tour. As it was we made it to Delta Junction right after 3 p.m. and immediately began acting like tourists.The people who we did manage meet in Delta Junction welcomed us to their town the best they could under such short notice.There was BJ Sloan, owner and operate of the Buffalo Center Drive-in, a family owned and operated burger joint since 2001. Prior to BJ’s father John purchasing the Drive-in, the restaurant had been known as Big Top since the late 1970s. BJ recommended the halibut sandwich or a milkshake made with ice cream from Alaska’s own Northern Lights Dairy.There were also Gordon and Sherry Decker of Diamond Willow Inn, the hotel we’d stay for the evening. I couldn’t have been more impressed with the accommodations.We were moving at break-neck speeds, but I knew this wouldn’t be the last time I’d make a stop in Delta Junction. I’m glad I did, too. I’ll know where to go next time.Pictures, video and interviews were being happening in a ravenous attempt to absorb as much information as possible about the city. And just like that it was 10:30 p.m. and we were getting up to leave for North Pole at 6:45 a.m.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Chicago absorbed its first loss in a 2-1 overtime setback to Calgary on Wednesday despite unloading 50 shots on goal, giving the team a staggering total of 97 in its last two games. Defenseman Michal Rozsival is set to make his season debut with the Blackhawks after missing the first three games with an upper-body injury.Nashville has the unenviable task of attempting to slow down Chicago in the second contest of a back-to-back after posting a 2-0 victory at Winnipeg on Friday night in its first road game. Pekka Rinne registered his 33rd career shutout for the Predators, who have permitted only five goals through the first four games. Nashville finished near the bottom of the division last season but dominated the season series with the Blackhawks, winning four of the five matchups and outscoring them 20-12.TV: 8:30 p.m. ET, FSN Tennessee (Nashville), WGN (Chicago)ABOUT THE PREDATORS (3-0-1): James Neal, acquired from Pittsburgh in a blockbuster offseason trade, failed to hit the scoresheet in the opening three games before finally netting his first goal in Friday's victory. Nashville coach Peter Laviolette elevated Filip Forsberg to the No. 1 line and he picked up an assist on Neal's goal to extend his season-opening points streak to four games. Mike Ribeiro, the other member of the top line, has scored goals in back-to-back games while yet another offseason addition, veteran defenseman Anton Volchenkov, collected a pair of assists Friday for his first two points.ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS (2-0-1): Andrew Shaw is coming off his first 20-goal campaign and is off a strong start centering the No. 2 line, scoring goals in each of the last two games - including a power-play tally against the Flames. "He's got a quick set of hands, he finds the puck and he's tricky offensively with a nice set of mitts," Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said. The Blackhawks are looking for production from the third line of Brad Richards, Bryan Bickell and Ben Smith, who have yet to register a point and could see their time together coming to an end with Kris Versteeg (lower body) moving closer to a return.OVERTIME1. Blackhawks G Corey Crawford lost all three starts against Nashville last season, although his team scored four goals in the three defeats.2. Nashville on Friday was named the host city for the 2016 NHL All-Star game.3.

h...<COL>While the New York Rangers aren't setting the world on fire, Rick Nash has blazed quite the trail to start the season. After scoring an NHL-best six goals in addition to the shootout winner in his last game, Nash looks to continue his hot hand when the Rangers host the San Jose Sharks on Sunday. "He's hot right now," Derick Brassard said of Nash. "I've known him for a long time and as soon as I saw him in the first practice, I knew he meant business."Nash doesn't have fond memories of the Sharks, against whom he suffered a concussion in a 9-2 rout on Oct. 8, 2013 that caused him to miss the following six weeks. San Jose has started this campaign with a flourish and answered a 4-3 shootout loss to the New York Islanders on Thursday with a 4-2 victory over New Jersey two nights later. Logan Couture, who scored a goal and set up two others versus the Devils, also netted the lone tally in the Sharks' 1-0 victory against the Rangers on March 16.TV: 5 p.m. ET, CSN California (San Jose), MSG (New York)ABOUT THE SHARKS (4-0-1): Patrick Marleau has no qualms about getting out of the blocks in a hurry. Marleau, who scored his fourth goal in five games on Saturday, opened last season with seven tallies in his first eight contests and began 2012-13 by netting nine during a five-game goal-scoring streak. Antti Niemi, who made 35 saves against New Jersey, stopped all 41 shots versus the Rangers in the latter meeting to improve to 2-1-1 lifetime against the club.ABOUT THE RANGERS (2-3-0): Kevin Hayes found himself in an interesting position in New York's 2-1 victory over Carolina on Thursday, centering a line with Nash and former Boston College teammate Chris Kreider. "Playing with two guys like this is pretty unbelievable," the Hobey Baker Award finalist told the team's web site. "Certainly playing with 'Kreids' again is obviously awesome. We succeeded in college, so hopefully that carries over. I'm like a little kid in a candy store, really, to be able to be out there with those two." Rookie Anthony Duclair will be scratched on Sunday and replaced in the lineup by Chris Mueller, who was recalled from Hartford of the American Hockey League.OVERTIME1. San Jose D Brent Burns has collected one goal and six assists during his five-game point streak.2. New York G Henrik Lundqvist rebounded after yielding six goals in each of his previous two contests to stop 29-of-30 shots versus the Hurricanes. Lundqvist fell in both meetings with the Sharks last season, getting pulled in the first encounter before suffering a hard-luck setback the other.3. The Sharks have outscored the opposition 7-0 in the first period this season.PREDICTION: Rangers 4, Sharks 2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

slumbering through the first half-dozen games in coach Lovie Smith's era, they are only two wins out of first place in
their ...<COL>The Chicago Blackhawks continued their hot start to the season with a victory in their last contest, while the Philadelphia Flyers rallied to the same result for their first triumph of the campaign. The teams look to keep the positive momentum going when they meet in Chicago on Tuesday. Although the Blackhawks improved to 3-0-1 following a 2-1 triumph over Nashville on Saturday, they have mustered just 11 goals in four contests."It's something we've talked about - we're happy with getting wins, but at the same time we want to keep building and keep getting better every game," Chicago's Brandon Saad said. "That's something we haven't seen too much of, and we need to pick it up." Philadelphia had no trouble finding the back of the net in its last game, with Claude Giroux providing the final salvo in overtime of a 6-5 win against Dallas on Saturday. The captain also came through in the clutch versus the Blackhawks in the last meeting, netting the overtime winner in a 3-2 triumph on March 18.TV: 8:30 p.m. ET, NBCSN, CSN Philadelphia, CSN ChicagoABOUT THE FLYERS (1-2-2): After piecing together a legacy of physical play that often resulted in constant trips to the penalty box, Philadelphia is averaging a league-low in penalty minutes (seven) this season. "We don't have any tough guys anymore," coach Craig Berube told reporters. "You want me to suit up? I'll get a couple penalties." Ray Emery, who isn't afraid to show his tough side, is in line to start versus his former team - against which he yielded six goals in a 7-2 setback on Dec. 11 before turning aside 23 shots in March.ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS (3-0-1): Chicago coach Joel Quenneville told reporters on Monday that Kris Versteeg could make his season debut after missing Chicago's first four games with a lower-body injury. Versteeg, who played 27 games for the Flyers in 2010-11, skated with Andrew Shaw and Patrick Kane on the second line in practice Monday. "The thing with 'Steeger', he gives you a lot of versatility, a lot of options," Quenneville said. "You can insert him left side, right side, can kill penalties, can move up with top guys."OVERTIME1. Philadelphia D Braydon Coburn will be a game-time decision as he attempts to return from a lower-body injury sustained in the season opener versus Boston.2. Chicago LW Patrick Sharp has collected one goal and four assists in his last three games against his former team.3.

"It was an awesome restart. Shane (Wilson, crew chief) kept telling me that lap times were great when everyone did two and we did four (tires), so it took us a while to get back (towards the lead) there, but four Goodyear tires in the end were the difference."On the final restart of the night, Dillon and Elliott battled extremely hard for the win, but they forgot about the guy behind them on four tires. Gaughan with a head of steam used momentum to clear his competition with six laps to go and cruised to his second career NNS win, and first on an oval. He also won June's road course race at Road America.Richard Childress Racing swept the top-three finishing positions with Brian Scott second and Dillon finishing third after a dominating performance.Gaughan, 39, credited his Earnhardt Childress Racing engine and transmission for assisting him in his triumph over the much younger Elliott (18) and Dillon (22)."There are great race teams and great young race car drivers, but the old dog still has something left," Gaughan said.Scott on the verge of netting his first career Nationwide victory, settled for his best performance of the season after restarting sixth."I thought it was the right call to take four tires at the end," Scott said. "I restarted sixth and got a good restart and got up to fourth and I thought we were going to win this race. But, unfortunately, we didn't get any long runs and our Shore Lodge Camaro was a little too tight."Dillon, who led 155 laps, said, "I'm sick for my guys. Our Bass Pros Chevy was top-notch, it's a good thing for confidence to lead all those laps, but this hurts for sure."Dillon's dominance would be challenged on Lap 171 when Cody Ware lost an engine. The fifth caution flag of the night proved to be a significant break for the leaders, as they avoided green flag pit stops. On pit road, Dillon exercised a two-tire stop with fuel with Chase Elliott, Michael McDowell and Elliott Sadler also vying for the same strategy.Racing resumed with Chase Elliott making a valiant effort to overtake the lead from Dillon. He was able to nip ahead of Dillon's No. 3 Bass Pro Shops Chevrolet, when Eric McClure crashed in Turn 4.With 19 laps to go, Elliott fended off a challenge from Dillon on the initial restart, but his opportunity to stretch his lead would be short lived, after Regan Smith made contact with Sam Hornish Jr. on Lap 184, sending him hard into the Turn 1 wall.A flawless restart from Elliott allowed the No. 9 NAPA Auto Parts Chevrolet Camaro to escape the hungry pack behind him. Again, Elliott's gap would be diminished by yet another caution for debris on Lap 190 - which would prove the difference in the race.Leaving Kentucky, fourth-place finisher Elliott holds a 20-point cushion over JR Motorsports teammate Regan Smith in the championship standings with six races remaining.Next up for the NASCAR Nationwide Series is a trip to Dover (Del.)

That’s when police say the son and nephew heard a “boom” as Wongtillin was hit by the Ford Explorer SUV Michels driven by Michels.Police say Wongittilin was seriously injured in the collision. The son and nephew tried CPR just as a cab driver who witnessed the crash reported the incident to police.Officers and members of the Nome Volunteer Ambulance Department arrived on scene and transported him to Norton Sound Regional Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead just after 2 a.m. Saturday.Court documents show Michels initially left the scene of the crash but returned “a short time later” with her father. She told officers she “did not see Wongitillin in the roadway” before hitting him.Michels failed several field sobriety tests and eventually was found to have a blood alcohol content of .227, more than two and a half times the legal limit of 0.08.Michels faces a felony manslaughter charge, a misdemeanor for leaving the scene of an accident, and a misdemeanor driving under the influence.Family members of Wongittilin said they were not sure why he was in Nome, but remembered him as a father, brother and halibut fisherman who volunteered his time with the Savoonga fire department. He was also an EMT.Wongittilin is survived by his wife and two children. His body is in Anchorage for an autopsy by the State Medical Examiner’s Office, but will be returned to Savoonga for burial.Information from KNOM was used in this report.

Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and the rest of Edmonton's 1983-84 team are in town to take part in Friday's festivities, and current coach Dallas Eakins hopes that squad's presence will help motivate his players to strive for at least the franchise's first playoff appearance in nine years. The Oilers have failed to reach the postseason since losing to Carolina in the 2006 Stanley Cup final.Edmonton made some modest additions over the summer, bringing in defenseman Nikita Nikitin and forwards Teddy Purcell and Benoit Pouliot, while parting ways with 2007 sixth-overall draft pick Sam Gagner after seven seasons. Calgary began its campaign Wednesday with a 4-2 home loss to Pacific Division-rival Vancouver. Paul Byron and Jiri Hudler scored while Jonas Hiller made 29 saves in his debut with the Flames following seven seasons with Anaheim.TV: 9:30 p.m. ET, RSN360ABOUT THE FLAMES (0-1-0): Karri Ramo is expected to start in goal Thursday as coach Bob Hartley intends to begin the season with a platoon. Sean Monahan overcame an illness and registered an assist in 17:43 of ice time against the Canucks. Hudler got off to a good start Wednesday, netting a goal after leading the team in scoring last season with 54 points - including a team-best 37 assists.ABOUT THE OILERS (2013-14: 29-44-9, 7TH IN PACIFIC): Netminder Ben Scrivens will get the start against Calgary while Viktor Fasth is expected to be in net Saturday in Vancouver. "They fully understand that they are equals," said Eakins, who also plans to platoon his goaltenders. "Just because one of them starts the home opener doesn't mean it has any more significance than the next game." Purcell scored a career-high 24 goals with Tampa Bay in 2011-12 but has tallied only 23 times over the last two seasons.OVERTIME1.

"(Tokarski) was awesome. Obviously, he was player of the game tonight."Starting the second end of back-to-back games, Tokarski turned aside 29 of 30 shots, including 14 of 15 in the first period, to give the Canadiens a chance to pull out a 2-1 shootout victory over the Washington Capitals Thursday night at the Verizon Center.Tomas Plekanec tied the score with 9:29 remaining in regulation and Brendan Gallagher slid a shot under Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby in the fifth round of the shootout to give the Habs their second win in as many nights.The Caps are 2-0-0 after two games. It took them four games to get to two wins last season."We started to hustle in the second period," Montreal coach Michel Therrien said. "We started to play with more passion. We started to execute a lot better. Obviously, we got dominated in the first period."The Capitals opened the scoring just 6:43 into the game on Andre Burakovsky's first career goal, but failed to convert on five power plays and failed to give Barry Trotz his first win as coach of the Capitals"If we lost the game, that's where we lost it, in the first period," said Trotz, who spent the previous 15 seasons as coach of the Nashville Predators. "We had back-to-back-to-back power plays and we had a chance to really take it over."They were sort of hanging. We really needed that second goal and we couldn't get it. They got momentum from their penalty kill and got back in the game When you have a team in survival mode you've got to stick it to them."After having a pair of third-period goals disallowed, the Canadiens figured karma finally would give them their due.Trailing 1-0 throughout most of the game, the Canadiens thought they had tied the score on a goal by right winger Pierre-Alexandre Parenteau with 10:49 remaining in the third period. However, winger Rene Bourque was called for interfering with Holtby, and the goal was waved off.Eighty seconds later, Montreal tied the score at 1-1 when Plekanec gained position on Washington left winger Alex Ovechkin and rifled a shot over the right shoulder of Holtby for his third goal in two games.The goal energized the Canadiens, and with Backstrom serving a boarding penalty, the Habs appeared to take their first lead of the game with 4:29 remaining in regulation. Referee Chris Lee pointed to the goal, but replays showed that Bourque's slap shot rang off the right post behind Holtby and the puck did not enter the netting."I don't know what caused the shift," Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen said, "but they did have more momentum during the second half of the game."After a scoreless overtime, Montreal centers Alex Galchenyuk and David Desharnais and Capitals forwards Nicklas Backstrom and Eric Fehr scored in the shootout, setting the stage for Gallagher's winner.Trotz did not go to Alex Ovechkin until the fourth round. Ovechkin went 2-for-16 in the shootout last season for a 12.5 percentage.NOTES: Washington Capitals D Mike Green sat out the season opener with an upper body injury.

The Hong Kong-flagged vessel has been en route from Port Angeles, Wash. to Tianjin, China.“The watchstanders consulted the duty flight surgeon who recommended the Astoria Bay monitor the men’s conditions and alter course to Dutch Harbor,” Eggert wrote. “The helicopter crew was launched to conduct the medevac when the men’s condition worsened.”An MH-60 Jayhawk launched from a forward operating location in Cold Bay and rendezvoused with the vessel about 207 miles southwest of the Aleutians East Borough community, hoisting the men during conditions including 25-knot winds and 10-foot seas. The crew flew the men to the Cold Bay Clinic, from which a commercial medevac flights took them to the Harborview Burn Center in Seattle.In an earlier Coast Guard statement on the Cold Bay FOL, Guardsmen say an Air Station Kodiak helicopter had been stationed there during the red king crab fishery in October and November. A chopper and crew returned to the FOL, which cuts up to two hours of flight time for incidents in the area compared to responses from Kodiak, in December for the opilio crab fishery.Eggert says that while the Coast Guard has increased its forward basing of ships and aircraft in Alaska as the U.S. revises its Arctic strategy, the Cold Bay FOL is still a temporary post.“It’s not a permanent one, as far as I’ve heard,” Eggert said.Eggert didn’t immediately have word on the nationality of the crewmen Thursday. With the medevac complete, the Astoria Bay has reportedly resumed its course to China.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Sean Parnell and the state Legislature, was slated to begin work Jan. 1. At least four troopers have already been assigned to the unit, which will conduct “directed patrols in areas of known criminal activity.”Mackie and Abarca are charged with one second-degree count each of both burglary and theft, with Mackie also arrested on a previous warrant for leaving the scene of a crash and tampering with evidence. The men are being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $5,000 bail each, with both requiring a court-approved third-party custodian for release.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Just try not to make these five all-too-common missteps.<COL>istockphoto/lvsignsThere's a good reason more than half of Americans pay someone else to prepare their taxes: It's easy to make mistakes.Rushing to meet a high-pressure deadline like tax day -- which has been pushed to Monday, April 18, this year -- it can be even easier to slip up.The growing popularity of tax preparation software and websites has managed to cut down on many mistakes. But whether you are filing an e-form or a traditional paper form, mistakes are still all-too common.And those mistakes can end up costing you. You may not end up facing a larger tax bill or penalties if your misstep is small enough, it could end up netting you a smaller refund or at the very least delaying the arrival of your refund -- and nobody wants that.Keep that in mind as you try to avoid these five common tax mistakes ...No. 5: Math errorsJimmy has four apples. If Uncle Sam takes two of those apples, how many will Jimmy have left? Less than if he had checked his math and realized he only owed Sam one apple.As kids, we used such simple word problems to master addition and subtraction. As years go by though, those can fade for even the best of us.That may explain why, according to the IRS, simple math mistakes are one of the most common missteps made on tax returns each year.Remember to always check -- and even double check -- your math when preparing your return. Especially if you're rushing to make the midnight deadline, it can be easy to forget to carry the one.Your math error may end up working in your favor, resulting in an IRS correction that nets you more money than expected. However, it can just as likely cost you money -- not to mention interest payments, penalties, etc.No. 4: Screwing up personal informationIt's amazing how simply transposing a couple digits on your tax return can end up indefinitely delaying your tax return.But that's just what can happen if you goof up your social security number or your bank's routing information. Making such mistakes with your personal information can actually be worse than screwing up your math.That's because the wrong bank account information could send your refund bouncing back to the IRS or straight into someone else's account. Considering that the IRS has no procedure for recovering lost electronically transferred funds, you could be out of luck.At the very least, making such mistakes with your personal information can slow down your payment as you wait for the IRS to sort it out.And filling out the wrong social security numbers, or forgetting to fill them in completely, can have the IRS disallowing certain tax breaks tied to your taxpayer identification number.No. 3: Forgetting unearned incomeTrust us, you don't want to overlook interest income, dividends, capital gains and other unearned income on your return. After all, the bank does tell the IRS about every penny you earn.Those pesky 1099 forms that go to the tax agency include your social security number, so even if you don't remember that unearned income, the IRS will.If you owe taxes on that income, the IRS will let you know. If they don't catch it right away, you could end up also owing interest and penalties on the unreported income.When it comes to actually reporting that income, be sure to figure any taxes you do owe correctly. If you're subject to the alternative minimum tax, keep an eye on box 9 of the 1099-INT form. Another box of interest is 1b (qualified dividends) of the 1099-DIV form, which are eligible for lower capital gains tax rates.No email address was supplied by.

To the Phoenix Coyotes, he's a minor league call-up.Proving once again that Phoenix is Rinne's personal Waterloo, the Coyotes victimized the Nashville Predators goalie early and often in a 5-3 victory Sunday at Jobing.com Arena that gave Phoenix a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series.Phoenix grabbed a 4-2 lead after two periods, marking the fourth time in six meetings with Rinne this season that the Coyotes had scored at least four goals. In six games against Rinne, the Coyotes have scored 21 times for an average of 3.5 goals per game. Rinne allowed 2.39 per game overall during the regular season."I don't think we're surprised, but we're definitely grateful getting some goals," said Coyotes captain Shane Doan, who had one of his team's five goals on a deflection. "We're not expecting to get nine more in the next two (games). We know how good he is and what he's capable of doing."This series was billed as a battle of elite goaltenders, and there was good reason for that before the games began. Rinne had just been named one of three finalists for the Vezina, while Smith was the playoffs' best goaltender in the first round, stonewalling the Chicago Blackhawks' stable of snipers on 95 percent of their shots.Yet, through two games, the teams have combined for 15 goals, with Phoenix netting nine. In the Coyotes' case, it was a welcome change after they spent most of the third period and overtime of Game 1 in their own zone while the Predators laid siege to their goal."Right through our lineup, we really had a concerted push," Phoenix coach Dave Tippett said of his club's Game 2 effort. "I would say this is the best 60 minutes we have played in the playoffs."Nashville looked to make a game of it when it scored its second power-play goal of the game early in the third period to cut the Phoenix lead to 4-3 on a one-timer from the left circle by defenseman Ryan Suter.But just as it had when the Predators cut a two-goal lead to one in the second period, Phoenix responded quickly. Doan deflected Derek Morris' shot from the point 3:36 into the third to restore the two-goal lead, and give Phoenix an 8-3 scoring edge in 5-on-5 play in the series."Every time we got back for a little bit, they scored another goal," Nashville forward Martin Erat said. "They capitalized on their home (ice) advantage. Now we have to do our job."Antoine Vermette, the Coyotes' lone trade deadline acquisition, put Phoenix up 1-0 on atic-tac-toe passing play from defenseman Keith Yandle and wing Mikkel Boedker midway through the first period. Boedker did most of the work, winning a foot race into the corner and outmuscling his man to feed the puck to Yandle, who slid it to Vermette at the far post. It was Vermette's team-leading fifth goal of the postseason.Nashville answered with a goal late in the period when defenseman Kevin Klein feathered a brilliant pass to Andrei Kostitsyn in front of the net. Kostitsyn chipped it over Smith's shoulder to send the teams to the first intermission tied at 1-1.The Coyotes took control of the game in the second period. Wing Radim Vrbata drove hard past Rinne and looked like he was heading around the net, but at the last moment he pulled up and centered a pass between Rinne's pads and onto the stick of center Martin Hanzal, who drove it home for a 2-1 lead.Vrbata then gave the Coyotes a rare two- goal lead on a freak play. Nashville forward David Legwand tried to glove a fluttering puck away from danger. Instead, he batted it right to Vrbata, who banged it home 7:05 into the period for a 3-1 lead.Nashville cut the lead to 3-2 on Patric Hornqvist's power-play goal at 11:20, but the Coyotes answered just 30 seconds later when a hard-driving Taylor Pyatt banged home a rebound of Doan's shot from the wing for a 4-2 Phoenix lead after the second.No email address was supplied by.

The sample was eventually confirmed to be that of the east African drug known as khat."It took a little research just to kind of confirm what it was and find it even in the schedule of controlled substances because it's so unusual," said Jamie Sunderland, Director of the Unalaska Department of the Public Safety.Police say they confiscated about 20 grams of the leafy material, sending the substance to the crime lab in Anchorage to be tested.Sunderland says while no charges have been filed just yet, the find could result in felony charges.A substance legal in several countries but illegal in the United States, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, it's estimated that more than 10 million people worldwide currently use khat.DEA officials say khat can cause manic behavior including delusions, paranoia, nightmares, hallucinations, and hyperactivity, but it is believed to also increase a user's level of alertness, something which is often a struggle for workers in the seafood industry."Drugs are a problem anywhere,” said Sunderland.  “They just bring a lot of hurt in people’s lives and lead to a lot of mayhem.”The largest bust of the drug occurred in 2006 in New York State when law enforcement agencies from around the country seized around 25 tons of khat valued at $10 million.Contact Blake EssigCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Nobody knows that yet," said J. Michael Kelly, a celebrity divorce lawyer in Los Angeles. Both parties were quite wealthy before they were married: Schwarzenegger as a movie star and Shriver as a television reporter and also a member of the Kennedy clan."He married royalty, so the question is would he dare actually propose a prenup to her?" mused Kelly.Also unclear is exactly how much this Hollywood titan is actually worth, but estimates place his wealth in the hundreds of millions of dollars.What is a matter of public record is what he owns, thanks to documents the ex-governor filed with the state of California. His portfolio is eclectic, ranging from a shopping mall in Ohio to a holding company that collects the proceeds from his legendary 1970's documentary "Pumping Iron."According to the "statement of economic interests" document that Schwarzenegger filed early in 2011, as required in his former role as governor of California, the body-building champ owns millions of dollars worth of stocks.But more importantly, Schwarzenegger, who was known as the "Austrian Oak" during his body builder days, owns Oak Productions, Inc., the business entity that holds the intellectual property and contract rights for his blockbuster movies. The document doesn't mention specific films, but the firm presumably serves as a conduit for earnings from the "The Terminator" and "Conan the Barbarian" franchises, and other Hollywood hits like "True Lies" and "The Running Man."Oak Productions derives income from corporations including Warner Brothers Pictures, part of Time Warner (also parent of CNNMoney), the Sony division Sony Pictures Entertainment, News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox, MGM, Disney's Worldwide Services unit, CBS-owned book publisher Simon & Schuster and Mattel Inc.The document of economic interests says that Oak Productions has a fair market value of at least $1 million with income of at least $100,000.But certified public accountant Tracy Stewart says that $1 million is just the bottom of the value range, and Oak Productions is certainly worth far more than that. She said that's typical in "statement of interest" documents, which specify the minimum value of individual assets, like $1 million in the case of Oak Productions."It could be a billion; it could be anything," she said. "There could be no limit as to how much he's worth."This also applies to his stock holdings, of at least $1 million each in Goldman Sachs and Starbucks holdings, as well as his real estate holdings, which includes a gym in Venice Beach, Calif.The muscleman is still making money from projects that he launched before marrying Shriver in the mid-1980s. Pumping Iron America, which represents the holdings for the 1970s documentary that made him famous as a smug, Machiavellian bodybuilder with a penchant for women and marijuana, is still netting him as much as $100,000 per year.Schwarzenegger also owns Fitness Publications, a publishing interest with Simon & Schuster that offers such titles as "Arnold's Fitness for Kids" and "The Muscular Gourmet." Earnings from these and other books, published mostly in the early 1980s, range from $10,000 to $100,000 per year.Shriver, who has four children with Schwarzenegger, is leaving him because he fathered a fifth child with his former housekeeper, a secret that he kept for about 13 years.If he doesn't have a prenup, Schwarzenegger could be in trouble. The statement of economic interests lists Shriver's assets -- stocks, real estate and trust funds -- as "separate property of spouse." Schwarzenegger's assets have no such designation and divorce lawyers say they could be considered "community" properties, meaning they're vulnerable."She could take up to half of anything earned during their marriage, less whatever they spent on living expenses," said Raoul Lionel Felder, the divorce lawyer for former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, movie star Elizabeth Taylor and Liza Minnelli's former husband David Gest. "[Schwarzenegger] has a lot of dough and my guess is that he has a prenup."But even that might not protect the former Governator, said Felder, because "many prenups self destruct after a number of years."Felder said that prenups often contain a clause that dissolves them after 10 or 15 years. Schwarzenegger and Shriver have been married for 25 years, and during that time he has made many of his most lucrative films.Without a prenup, half of Schwarzenegger's earnings over the last quarter-century could be "up for grabs" by Shriver, said Felder, which could spark a legal "World War III" between the celebrity spouses."It's going to be the most visible of divorces," said Felder.Copyright 2012 byCNN NewSource.

Period. And although traditional techniques (like the ones recommended by theChicago pest control expertsat theUniversity of Illinois Extension Service) revolve around killing these creatures -- either chemically or manually -- a small but enthusiastic group of food growers is re-imagining the ethics of gardening. And including a strict “no-kill” policy.From bugs to birds to bunny rabbits, you can control almost every animal annoyance without resorting to violent means. But before you even begin to target the critters, there are a few very general rules for keeping your crops protected: 1) growing in raised beds as opposed to the ground, 2) using scattered and diverse planting patterns (no monocultures) and 3) practicing crop rotation each season. These are fundamental to a healthy backyard food or flower ecosystem.As for the actual pests, aim to reduce them, not to completely wipe them out. You’ve got to be realistic, and workwiththe natural world, not against it. Focus your energy on making your plants strong.  Healthy soil will build hardy plants that can handle a small assault now and them. Try to include plenty of pest-deterrent allies, like marigolds, garlic, basil, coriander, thyme, dahlias, dill, etc. And finally, for those pesky little pests . . .Build Barriers for Snails and SlugsA fence around a fortress, a moat around a castle and a ring around your tomatoes: walls work! An easy homemade version is a section of 2-liter soda bottle, 6-10 inches high, encircling each plant at the base. The crawlies can creep up, but they won’t getover.Another effective and store-bought solution is copper tape (the kind thatplumbersuse). This is just exactly what it sounds like – strips of copper that are sticky on one side. Snails and slugs won’t cross the copper. I use it to line the ledges of all my raised beds.Trap and TransplantThere are a number of easy ways to ensnare your garden enemies. Try planting a few sacrificial plants in easy-to-access locations (like in the ground beside the raised beds). Brassicas work especially well for drawing bugs away.Snails and slugs like to hide during the hot day, so give them a place to go like an easy-to-flip piece of stone or a piece of log, for example. I like to use wide wooden planks. All of these make great slug-collectors, so you’ll always know where they’re hiding during the day.Giving them a treat -- like apple cores or melon rinds -- is an excellent way to draw them out. The bugs will flock to the fruity bits.Once you’ve set all these traps, it’s just a matter of checking them. Collect the bad bugs in a bucket while you’re weeding and pruning in your beds. Pull them off the sacrificial plants and out from under your slug collectors and off the flavorful fruits. Then take that bucket and move the whole lot of them -- to the front yard, the nearest park or wherever you see fit. I have an overgrown median strip dividing the street in front of my house -- I like to walk my bad bugs over there to drop them off.The Big Guys (Birds and Mammals)Depending on where you live, you may be contending with heftier foes. But that’s fine; you can still fight back. Nets are effective at keeping out all sorts of hungry critters. Scaffolding is easy to build, and netting can be purchased at any garden supply store. Just remember to leave areas that you can reopen, so you can get in there and work (and harvest!)There areno-kill rodent trapsfor capturing rats, gophers, and groundhogs. Just remember to check them daily, and you’ll have to figure out where you’re going to release them (like the woods or a local park).It’s an oldie but goodie: bars of soap will keep the deer away. Try putting a strongly scented bar in an old pair of pantyhose and hanging them near your plants. Deer-deterrent magic!If neighborhood cats and dogs are your problem, some people have found success at keeping them out of flower beds by sprinkling chopped up grapefruit peels on their flower beds.And there you have it, a few easy steps and you’ll be able to get our garden certified “cruelty-free”.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/compassionate-garden-pest-controlDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

Finally, New York clinched the American League Division Series with a 3-1 Game 5 victory.Andy Pettite will start ALCS Game 1 against the Tigers.The win required a masterful complete-game performance by ace CC Sabathia, a surprising stolen base by slugger Mark Teixiera, a little good fortune on a foul ball call that may never be made entirely clear, and an old-fashioned late home run from slumping slugger Curtis Granderson, who was kept in the lineup while Alex Rodriguez was benched."You know, they're a very good club and they're a very resilient club," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of the Orioles, who had split the previous 22 games against New York. "You have a bunch of young kids over there that just play the game the right way and play hard."It's an accomplishment for both clubs, because they never went away," Girardi later added. "People thought they were going to go away; they never went away. And I am very proud of our club for staying in."Denied a playoff appearance for 15 years or a lead in the AL East in the second half no matter how hard they charged, the Orioles fought to the last out, even when Sabathia (2-0) had appeared to finally put them to sleep."They have a very well-deserved rest," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of his players. "... And that was a challenge competing against (the Yankees). We just couldn't quite get over the hump."Even after a just-missed home run by Orioles left fielder Nate McLouth was ruled foul in the sixth -- a play that couldn't help but stir the Jeffrey Maier demons for Orioles fans -- and a 3-0 Yankees lead for Sabathia after seven one-hit innings, Baltimore rallied once more.Matt Wieters led off the eighth with the Orioles' second hit of the game and Manny Machado drew a walk. Sabathia battled past a 3-1 count to strike out Mark Reynolds -- who homered four times in three games at Yankee Stadium in September -- for the first out.But designated hitter Lew Ford singled in a run past a diving Derek Jeter at shortstop to make it 3-1.Robert Andino then hit an appropriately named Baltimore chop in front of the mound and Sabathia's throw to second for the force was late, loading the bases for McLouth.In the sixth, McLouth had seemingly hit a game-tying home run to right, to make it 1-1, but it was ruled foul. Sixteen years after the infamous fan interference play in which Yankees fan Maier stole a ball in the field of play that was ruled a home run for Jeter, the umpires this time had a chance to review the play with instant replay.But the technology was not especially helpful, as the repeated viewings made it difficult to definitively ascertain whether the ball had just barely nicked the foul pole. The umpires later said the ball didn't appear to deflect or hit the foul pole netting and so there was no reason to overturn the call."Someone said it nicked the poke, but that didn't beat us," Showalter said, adding he was grateful they reviewed the play.McLouth then struck out.But now he had another shot in the eighth, with the bases loaded and the fans at Yankee Stadium roaring.But Sabathia geared up and struck him out on a cutter, tying his previous postseason game career high with his eighth strikeout.J.J. Hardy then hit a slow roller to Jeter, whose bruised foot didn't allow him to play the field in Game 4. Jeter charged and fired to first, just nipping Hardy.Sabathia then pitched a perfect ninth to wrap it up, including his career-high ninth strikeout. Though he threw 121 pitches and had also thrown 8 2/3 innings to win Game 1, he said there was no need to have a "conversation" about returning for the ninth. With the Yankees set to play again Saturday, he wanted to spare the bullpen."It is what I am here for," Sabathia, who battled injuries in the second half, said of pitching under pressure. "It is what I play the game for. I guess I should feel, you know, a little pressure or something like that, but I don't."After a season full of a home run-or-bust offense, the Yankees broke through against Orioles starter Jason Hammel (0-1) unconventionally.After the Yankees were no-hit for four innings, Teixeira led off the fifth with a single to right. The Yankees' slugger, who was out for most of the stretch run with a calf injury, stunned the Orioles and the crowd by stealing second base."We talked about it a little bit yesterday and a little bit today that if the opportunity presented itself, they're not holding me on ... I thought we needed a little spark," Teixeira said. "I thought we needed a guy in scoring position and I took a chance."No email address was supplied by.

Period. And although traditional techniques (like the ones recommended by theChicago pest control expertsat theUniversity of Illinois Extension Service) revolve around killing these creatures -- either chemically or manually -- a small but enthusiastic group of food growers is re-imagining the ethics of gardening. And including a strict “no-kill” policy.From bugs to birds to bunny rabbits, you can control almost every animal annoyance without resorting to violent means. But before you even begin to target the critters, there are a few very general rules for keeping your crops protected: 1) growing in raised beds as opposed to the ground, 2) using scattered and diverse planting patterns (no monocultures) and 3) practicing crop rotation each season. These are fundamental to a healthy backyard food or flower ecosystem.As for the actual pests, aim to reduce them, not to completely wipe them out. You’ve got to be realistic, and workwiththe natural world, not against it. Focus your energy on making your plants strong.  Healthy soil will build hardy plants that can handle a small assault now and them. Try to include plenty of pest-deterrent allies, like marigolds, garlic, basil, coriander, thyme, dahlias, dill, etc. And finally, for those pesky little pests ...Build Barriers for Snails and SlugsA fence around a fortress, a moat around a castle and a ring around your tomatoes: walls work! An easy homemade version is a section of 2-liter soda bottle, 6-10 inches high, encircling each plant at the base. The crawlies can creep up, but they won’t getover.Another effective and store-bought solution is copper tape (the kind thatplumbersuse). This is just exactly what it sounds like -- strips of copper that are sticky on one side. Snails and slugs won’t cross the copper. I use it to line the ledges of all my raised beds.Trap and TransplantThere are a number of easy ways to ensnare your garden enemies. Try planting a few sacrificial plants in easy-to-access locations (like in the ground beside the raised beds). Brassicas work especially well for drawing bugs away.Snails and slugs like to hide during the hot day, so give them a place to go like an easy-to-flip piece of stone or a piece of log, for example. I like to use wide wooden planks. All of these make great slug-collectors, so you’ll always know where they’re hiding during the day.Giving them a treat -- like apple cores or melon rinds -- is an excellent way to draw them out. The bugs will flock to the fruity bits.Once you’ve set all these traps, it’s just a matter of checking them. Collect the bad bugs in a bucket while you’re weeding and pruning in your beds. Pull them off the sacrificial plants and out from under your slug collectors and off the flavorful fruits. Then take that bucket and move the whole lot of them – to the front yard, the nearest park or wherever you see fit. I have an overgrown median strip dividing the street in front of my house – I like to walk my bad bugs over there to drop them off.The Big Guys (Birds and Mammals)Depending on where you live, you may be contending with heftier foes. But that’s fine; you can still fight back. Nets are effective at keeping out all sorts of hungry critters. Scaffolding is easy to build, and netting can be purchased at any garden supply store. Just remember to leave areas that you can reopen, so you can get in there and work (and harvest!)There areno-kill rodent trapsfor capturing rats, gophers, and groundhogs. Just remember to check them daily, and you’ll have to figure out where you’re going to release them (like the woods or a local park).It’s an oldie but goodie: bars of soap will keep the deer away. Try putting a strongly scented bar in an old pair of pantyhose and hanging them near your plants. Deer-deterrent magic!If neighborhood cats and dogs are your problem, some people have found success at keeping them out of flower beds by sprinkling chopped up grapefruit peels on their flower beds.And there you have it, a few easy steps and you’ll be able to get our garden certified “cruelty-free”.

Baker faces one count of retaliating against a witness, related to the case against Sacramento, Calif. man Richard Corum.“According to the indictment, on July 3, 2013, Baker assaulted Individual A causing him/her bodily injury, in order to retaliate against Individual A for providing testimony in the trial of United States v. Richard Corum,” prosecutors wrote.Corum was convicted this summer of witness tampering, as well as taking part in a conspiracy to supply drug dealers with the drug Oxycontin. Prosecutors say the conspirators bought Oxycontin for $13 per pill then sold it for $30 to $60, netting millions of dollars from the four-year scheme from 2007 through 2011.Corum's attorney admitted that the defendant had punched one of the witnesses against him in the case, but claimed the blow was in self-defense.If convicted, Baker could face either or both a 30-year prison term or a $250,000 fine.Loeffler’s office credited the federal Drug Enforcement Agency and Alaska State Troopers with cooperating in the investigation against Baker.(Copyright © 2013, KTUU-TV)No email address was supplied by.

Try these tips to get started.<COL>iStock / bowdenimagesBy Katie Marks,NetworxHave you decided to hop on board with the urbangardeningtrend? Whether you're limited to a few buckets in a sunny corner of the house, a little garden on the porch, or you have actual growing space outdoors, you might be a little intimidated. What do you grow, and when? How should you maintain a garden? Which supplies do you really need? Is it going to be expensive to set up? Don't worry! We love gardening, we love gardeners, and we also know how scary it can be to start out.First things first: you don't need to be a green thumb to grow a garden. If you haven't had luck with plants before, don't think that means you can't grow veggies, okay? Like many things in life, gardening requires some skills, some experience, and some knowledge. You might not have those things yet, but lots of other people do, and they're ready to share it with you.If you want to grow a garden, start small. Sure, you might WANT to get extravagant and plant out a huge area with all kinds of veggies this year, but it might be too much for you. Start with a few containers, so you can get the hang of things. There are several reasons we recommend starting small and scaling large as you go. The first is that it gives you inexpensive experience -- because some things are going to die or behave unexpectedly in any year of gardening, but especially your first year.You might feel gloomy when your single container of kale dies, but imagine how much worse you'd feel if it was a whole bed. Container gardening gives you a chance to learn about what works and what doesn't, so you can grow in larger quantities in the future.Gardening isn't just about your own skills and knowledge, like knowing when to plant (kale, FYI, should be planted in early spring to early summer) and having good soil (more about that in a minute). It's also about environmental factors that are harder to control. You need to learn about your microclimate and how it behaves so you can find out what grows and what doesn't -- and you don't want to learn that at the cost of a huge vegetable garden in your first year.So, start with a couple of containers or small beds of things you're really interested in trying. Kale is actually a great choice, because it's extremely hardy and it tends to be forgiving. Lettuce, while a bit fussy, can be another good choice because it's a great barometer for rough weather. You can also try beets, peas, beans, strawberries, and anything else you might desire!Consider establishing some perennial herbs, too, so your long-term garden can start shaping up.What to grow in?You can use all sorts of things as containers. The bottom line is that they shouldn't contain toxins, and they shouldn't be prone to falling apart. Ceramic and wood planters are a choice, of course, but so are plastic buckets, bath tubs, crates built out of pallets and other scrap wood, and even cooking pots. Your containers should have drainage, and that's about it! If you're growing in the ground, you'll need to prepare beds. Dig two shovel-depths down to turn and aerate the soil well, and line the soil with hardware cloth if you have gophers, voles, and other underground pests. (Another option is raised beds, which you build and fill with soil.)Speaking of soil...soil medium is critical, and it takes years to build up good dirt. For your first year, you may want to buy soil or see if a local gardening center or community garden has a soil supply for beginners (if you're gardening in an urban environment, you may be able to get a free starter kit that includes dirt!). Also add compost to your soil, which you can buy or make -- here'sa great guide to composting.Use a soil testing kitto find out what's in your soil and which amendments you need to add to improve it for gardening. Think of yourself as a dirt farmer as much of a gardener, and don't stress out about getting everything perfect in your first year. As you proceed, your soil will get better.Wherever you set up, it needs to be sunny. Some plants need as much as ten hours of sun a day to really take off. If you have limited sunny spots, you need to read seed packets carefully to determine which plants you can grow. Look for shade or part-shade plants that will be okay without a lot of direct sun.What to grow?Great question! Choose veggies that will thrive in your climate, and don't hesitate to ask at the nursery for advice. Many cultivars are specially bred for unusually cold, hot, wet, or dry climates, and the staff can help you pick the perfect tomato, lettuce, or bean for your climate. Follow the guides listed on seed packages to determine when you should start your seeds. You can start them early indoors and plant them out after the frost, or you can wait until after the last frost to grow outdoors -- your crops will mature later, but you won't have to deal with seedlings all over the house.TheFarmer's Almanachas a great guide to growing seasons, gardening tips, and what to grow where. You can pick up a copy at a bookstore or hardware store, or take advantage of their online resources!Growing plants really often is as easy as sticking seeds in soil, watering, and waiting for them to sprout. At a minimum, you just need some dirt, some seeds, and a water source. If you want to get fancier, you'll need seed starting trays (if you plan on starting indoors and moving outdoors), which are often free at nurseries (they end up with extras), and can be made at home with egg cartons or yogurt cups. A spade is helpful, as is a cultivator for handling weeds, and a small trowel for transplanting.Okay, it's growing, now what?Watch it, water it, eat it! Keep an eye on your growing plants for signs of pests, like nibbled leaves, obvious insect infestation, or mysteriously missing seedlings, and take appropriate action (netting can discourage birds, crushed eggshells deter snails, and many organic pest management solutions take on insect pests and infections). Keep your soil damp, not soaked, and don't allow it to dry out, unless directions for a given plant specify that it likes to dry out.For your first year, skip installing a fancy irrigation system. You should wait to see how much you enjoy gardening, and because your garden will probably expand, it doesn't make sense to put in a system yet -- the shape, size, and structure of your garden may change and you don't want to be hemmed in by a system you put in before you knew what you needed. When youareready for irrigation, talk to yourplumberabout setting up the hookups to the water supply.As things start to mature, you get to the best part: eating! And we think you know how to do that.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/gardening-for-dummiesDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

It's easy to make mistakes. Just try not to make these five all-too-common missteps.<COL>iStock/ebstockThere's a good reason more than half of Americans pay someone else to prepare their taxes: It's easy to make mistakes.Rushing to meet a high-pressure deadline like tax day  it can be even easier to slip up.The growing popularity of tax preparation software and websites has managed to cut down on many mistakes. But whether you are filing an e-form or a traditional paper form, mistakes are still all-too common.And those mistakes can end up costing you. You may not end up facing a larger tax bill or penalties if your misstep is small enough, it could end up netting you a smaller refund or at the very least delaying the arrival of your refund -- and nobody wants that.Keep that in mind as you try to avoid these five common tax mistakes ...No. 5: Math errorsJimmy has four apples. If Uncle Sam takes two of those apples, how many will Jimmy have left? Less than if he had checked his math and realized he only owed Sam one apple.As kids, we used such simple word problems to master addition and subtraction. As years go by though, those can fade for even the best of us.That may explain why, according to the IRS, simple math mistakes are one of the most common missteps made on tax returns each year.Remember to always check -- and even double check -- your math when preparing your return. Especially if you're rushing to make the midnight deadline, it can be easy to forget to carry the one.Your math error may end up working in your favor, resulting in an IRS correction that nets you more money than expected. However, it can just as likely cost you money -- not to mention interest payments, penalties, etc.No. 4: Screwing up personal informationIt's amazing how simply transposing a couple digits on your tax return can end up indefinitely delaying your tax return.But that's just what can happen if you goof up your social security number or your bank's routing information. Making such mistakes with your personal information can actually be worse than screwing up your math.That's because the wrong bank account information could send your refund bouncing back to the IRS or straight into someone else's account. Considering that the IRS has no procedure for recovering lost electronically transferred funds, you could be out of luck.At the very least, making such mistakes with your personal information can slow down your payment as you wait for the IRS to sort it out.And filling out the wrong social security numbers, or forgetting to fill them in completely, can have the IRS disallowing certain tax breaks tied to your taxpayer identification number.No. 3: Forgetting unearned incomeTrust us, you don't want to overlook interest income, dividends, capital gains and other unearned income on your return. After all, the bank does tell the IRS about every penny you earn.Those pesky 1099 forms that go to the tax agency include your social security number, so even if you don't remember that unearned income, the IRS will.If you owe taxes on that income, the IRS will let you know. If they don't catch it right away, you could end up also owing interest and penalties on the unreported income.When it comes to actually reporting that income, be sure to figure any taxes you do owe correctly. If you're subject to the alternative minimum tax, keep an eye on box 9 of the 1099-INT form. Another box of interest is 1b (qualified dividends) of the 1099-DIV form, which are eligible for lower capital gains tax rates.iStock / peanut8481After filing your taxes you might be wondering how long you should keep your tax records and documents.

What's not so great, however, is the havoc these birds can wreak on your home and garden. Fortunately, you have a number of humane pest control options when it comes to discouraging swallows and helping them settle somewhere more appropriate and healthy for both them and their young families.Historically, swallows nested in cliffs, which provided ample overhangs and shelter for building their distinctive mud nests. However, buildings offer many of the same functions, as demonstrated by themassive swallow community of San Juan Capistrano, which has become internationally famous. The birds settle in at the eaves of homes and other structures, taking advantage of ample building materials and the perfect shelter to create their homes.On a basic level,swallows are a nuisance. Their nests can look unsightly, for starters, and they leave long streaks of you-know-what down the outside walls of your home. Swallows also tend to create messes around their nests that can be unpleasant to look at. But the problem doesn't stop there. The birds and their nests can host serious zoonotic diseases that can cross from the birds to people, including salmonella and toxoplasmosis, and their nests become attractive to insects who will settle in and create a secondary problem for you.If this has you thinking you should run out into the yard right now and start powerwashing those nests down, put down the hose and compressor. Swallows, along with their nests, eggs, and young, are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. You can't harass or "take" (government language for "kill") swallows and their young, nor can you interfere with their nests while they are in active use -- unless, of course, you fancy paying a big fine.So whatcanyou do?Install bird netting.This fine-meshed product can be installed under your eaves after swallows depart to keep the next generation from settling in. Since they can't fit through the netting, they won't be able to use the old nests.Another option is bird slopes. These PVC panels are designed to prevent nesting and roosting activities by creating a smooth, slippery surface that repels little bird toes. Clip them on under your eaves to prevent swallow encampments. Contact aLos Angeles carpenterto discuss bird slope installation options.Slick surfaces. Swallows have a hard time nesting on metals, glass, and smoothly-painted surfaces. That's good news for you, if you're willing to make some architectural tweaks to the exterior of your home to convince the birds to set up camp elsewhere.Nest removal. Depending on where you live,you may be allowed to take down nests outside of the breeding season without a permit. If the swallows are actively using their nests, you need a permit from an environmental agency, and a compelling reason like a significant threat to human health. With the nests removed, you can talk to anexterminatorabout addressing remaining insects.Source:http://www.networx.com/article/controlling-swallowsNo email address was supplied by.

What’s more, mosquitoes carry the threat of serious disease such as West Nile fever. Here is a guide to prevention and treatment of this seasonal hazard … the natural way.BONUS: Many of the treatment methods use everyday items you’re likely to have with you on the beach or in the woods – places where mosquitoes tend to strike.Stop Mosquitoes Before They StartTo prevent mosquitoes breeding in the first place, drain any standing water on your property. Where this is impossible or undesirable (for example, an ornamental birdbath), change the water frequently. Add apple cider vinegar or salt to kill mosquito larvae in the water. Vegetable oil may be floated on the surface in difficult-to-access areas like storm drains. If your neighbors do not deal with stagnant water on their grounds, it may be necessary to contact your local vector program. Everywhere in America, pest control is a top priority.Set up BarriersWear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks and a hat or headscarf outside to make it harder for the mosquito to get to its target – your skin. White orlight colored clothingtends to be less visible to mosquitoes than dark or bright shades. Indoors, protect yourself and your family with window screens and mosquito netting around beds or cribs.Make Yourself Less TastyScented personal care products – shampoos, creams and the like – add to your mosquito appeal and are best replaced with more neutral versions.  Forego bananas (AKA “mosquito bait”) but do eat garlic to make your flavor less appealing to pesky insects. Ingest Vitamin B1 via supplements or dietary sources like nuts, peas and potatoes. Mosquitoes are also attracted to the lactic acid in perspiration, so exercising inside during mosquito season is ideal. However, if you are a dedicated jogger or dog walker, avoid strenuous sessions at times of day (early morning and evening) and in areas (dense growth and swamps) preferred by mosquitoes. Since mosquitoes’ tastes run to hot meals, try to keep your body temperature low.Apply Topical RepellentsMany topical mosquito repellents on the market contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) as their active ingredient. While DEET is considered the most effective insect repellent, it may causeside effectsranging from skin irritation to severe neurological damage. Instead, try applying a natural essential oil; lemon eucalyptus, lavender, neem andcatnipare recommendations. Black pepper extract is another option. Or rub yourself with a cut onion or citrus peel. Treat only exposed skin, not areas that are protected by clothing.Keep Mosquitoes from Crashing Your Outdoor PartyMosquitoes are notorious for turning outdoor picnics and barbecues into their own al fresco feeding sessions. Keep them at bay by burning citronella candles. A rotating fan will serve a dual purpose – keeping you and your guests coolandmaking insect pests unwelcome.Treat Itchy, Swollen BitesShould you be bitten in spite of all your efforts, resist the temptation to scratch, due to the danger of breaking the skin and exposing yourself to infection. (Besides, scratching only makes the irritation worse!) Instead, get relief from the itch by numbing your nerves with ice or a cold compress. A used teabag will not only cool, but also act as an astringent to reduce swelling. Some treatments do dual duty: asalt water soakeases the discomfort of both mosquito and chigger bites, while vinegar is also useful against the burning sensation of jellyfish stings. For longer-lasting results, dab on honey, aloe vera gel or a paste of baking soda or powdered milk.Get HelpItching, swelling and pain are normal, though unpleasant, reactions to mosquito bites. If you experience more serious symptoms, such as joint and muscle aches, sudden weakness, fever, headache or disorientation, consult a qualified medical professional immediately.Source: http://www.networx.com/article/mosquito-bites-natural-prevention-and-tNo email address was supplied by.

The bugs will flock to the fruity bits.Once you’ve set all these traps, it’s just a matter of checking them. Collect the bad bugs in a bucket while you’re weeding and pruning in your beds. Pull them off the sacrificial plants and out from under your slug collectors and off the flavorful fruits. Then take that bucket and move the whole lot of them -- to the front yard, the nearest park or wherever you see fit. I have an overgrown median strip dividing the street in front of my house – I like to walk my bad bugs over there to drop them off.The Big Guys (Birds and Mammals)Depending on where you live, you may be contending with heftier foes. But that’s fine; you can still fight back. Nets are effective at keeping out all sorts of hungry critters. Scaffolding is easy to build, and netting can be purchased at any garden supply store. Just remember to leave areas that you can reopen, so you can get in there and work (and harvest!)There areno-kill rodent trapsfor capturing rats, gophers, and groundhogs. Just remember to check them daily, and you’ll have to figure out where you’re going to release them (like the woods or a local park).It’s an oldie but goodie: bars of soap will keep the deer away. Try putting a strongly scented bar in an old pair of pantyhose and hanging them near your plants. Deer-deterrent magic!If neighborhood cats and dogs are your problem, some people have found success at keeping them out of flower beds by sprinkling chopped up grapefruit peels on their flower beds.And there you have it, a few easy steps and you’ll be able to get our garden certified “cruelty-free”.

Word spread quickly among sports memorabilia dealers, who were warned by law enforcement to be on the lookout for the stolen goods in case the crooks try to resell them quickly, the New York Post reported."All of the dealers are very connected, so I don't know how anyone could sell them," said David Kohler, owner of SCP Auctions. "It's a very significant collection and this is a big loss to the Berra family and the game of baseball."Police suspect that the burglars were able to gain entry into the museum, which is located on the campus of Montclair State University, through a building that connects an attached minor league stadium.The Post said Berra's 10 World Series rings are estimated to be worth at least $150,000 a piece with some netting $250,000. Several memorabilia dealers said his MVP awards have a value of between $100,000 to $250,000.The burglars also pilfered the glove Berra used to catch Don Larsen's perfect World Series game in 1956 -- ironically on the 58th anniversary of that historic performance.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

The Islanders would love even more return on their investment when the Metropolitan Division rivals continue their home-and-home series in Long Island on Saturday. Defenseman Johnny Boychuk collected a goal and two assists while logging a game-high 23:11 of ice time in his first contest since being acquired from Boston last week."It feels good to get a win, but even better the way things happened for me," Boychuk said after his team spoiled the coaching debut of Bill Peters. Signed to four-year deals, Jaroslav Halak (21 saves) and Mikhail Grabovski (goal) also fared well while defenseman Nick Leddy saw nearly 18 1/2 minutes of ice time after being acquired from Chicago last week. Cam Ward struggled mightily in the opener and is expected take a spectator's role in favor of Anton Khudobin, who has split a pair of career meetings with New York while stopping 59-of-63 shots. TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Carolinas, MSG Plus (New York)ABOUT THE HURRICANES (0-1-0): In addition to Khudobin, Carolina is likely to see Brett Bellemore and Ryan Murphy inserted into Saturday's lineup. "We've got to look at getting better back there," Peters said. "... We've got some guys who can come in back there. 'Murph' would add something on the power play and help us move the puck 5-on-5, and 'Belly' is hard to play against." Rookie Victor Rask acquitted himself well in his NHL debut, and originally was credited with his first career point - and assist - before a scoring change in the third period.ABOUT THE ISLANDERS (1-0-0): Playing his second season with the club, Brock Nelson received top billing as he collected two goals and two assists after recording 14 and 12, respectively, in 2013-14. Captain John Tavares set up three tallies in his first game since suffering a knee injury during the Winter Olympics. While obviously overjoyed with the result, Tavares did his best to keep the bigger picture in perspective. "It's one game," he told Newsday. "We don't want to fall in love with it too much."OVERTIME1. Both teams scored a pair of power-play goals, with the Islanders netting one in both the first and second periods and the Hurricanes recording two in the third.2. Carolina has dropped two straight meetings with the Islanders after winning six in a row.3. New York RW Michael Grabner is sidelined indefinitely after undergoing sports hernia surgery, Newsday reported.

Ryan Johansen, who joined Scott Hartnell by notching two assists, has three in two games after ending his training-camp holdout by signing a three-year contract extension.Rick Nash scored in the third period but was booed every time he touched the puck as the top-line forward was playing in his second game at Nationwide Arena after spending his first nine seasons in Columbus. Lee Stempniak also tallied and rookie Anthony Duclair added two assists for his first career points for the Rangers, who will play their home opener versus Toronto on Sunday. After scoring on his lone shot in Columbus' 3-1 season-opening victory over Buffalo on Thursday, Anisimov drew first blood as his one-timer from above the left faceoff circle beat Cam Talbot (19 saves) at 6:24 of the first period. Foligno doubled the advantage with 2 1/2 minutes remaining in the session by cleaning up his own rebound while falling to the ice.Stempniak accepted a nifty give-and-go feed from Duclair before beating Bobrovsky from the right circle to trim the deficit at 5:43 of the second period. Atkinson backhanded a loose puck into the net to regain Columbus' two-goal lead four minutes later and Bobrovsky denied Martin St. Louis from in close late in the session to draw a standing ovation from the crowd.GAME NOTEBOOK: Anisimov briefly exited the contest midway into the first period after taking an elbow to the face from Stempniak. Hartnell retaliated with a high hit on Stempniak moments later. ... New York's Matt Hunwick logged 17:17 of ice time after being inserted into the lineup in place of injured D Dan Boyle, who is expected to be sidelined four-to-six weeks with a broken hand. ...

The United States Geological Survey released a report indicating the sea otter population has rebounded to pre-spill numbers."In our last three to four years we've noted that now animals are getting old again, so the age distribution has gone back to the pre-spill pattern," USGS' lead research Bethany Ballachey said.Basically, Ballchey is saying the majority of sea otters now have the opportunity for a full life cycle like they did before the spill. The population was struggling in Valdez till recently and now that life cycle has the potential to reach its natural completion.While wildlife advocates are celebrating the increased numbers, they note the report doesn't tell the whole story. Marine biologist Rick Steiner says the present-day sea otter population in the sound doesn't yet meet his expectations for full recovery."We have to not only look at what the sea otter population was pre-spill, but we have to imagine where they'd be 25 years later," Steiner said. "The USGS study presumes sea otters were at equilibrium density pre-spill and therefore if they return to the pre-spill numbers now a quarter of a century later, they are fully recovered. I think that's a questionable presumption."Another smaller species in the sound is also being studied and experts say it plays a huge role in the overall health of the ecosystem. Scott Pegau from the Oil Spill Recovery Institute says since a year after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the herring has disappeared in the sound."We think the exposure combined with the nutritional stress made the herring more susceptible to disease so there's a large disease outbreak that caused the adult population to crash," Pegau said.Pegau says the population prior to the spill was about 80 to 100 thousand tons. To open a fishery, there has to be an excess of 22,000 tons and Pegau says those numbers haven't been seen since 1998.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

Louis Arena i...<COL>The Pittsburgh Penguins boast a potent power play while the Detroit Red Wings have yet to allow a goal while short-handed on 18 occasions this season. The special teams likely will be put to the test when the clubs meet at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on Thursday. Pittsburgh converted on eight of its first 17 opportunities with the man advantage before going 0-for-2 in a 5-3 loss to Keystone State-rival Philadelphia on Wednesday.While the Penguins stumbled in their last contest, Pavel Datsyuk didn't look like he missed a step in his season debut on Tuesday - notching an assist before netting a highlight-reel goal that was later disallowed due to goaltender interference during Detroit's 2-1 overtime loss to Montreal. Despite the impressive performance, coach Mike Babcock believes the Russian superstar will need some time to get his conditioning back on track. "It's going to take him a bit," Babcock said of Datsyuk, who had been sidelined with a separated shoulder since Sept. 22. "He's an elite player, but when you miss training camp, it takes you some time. I don't care how good a player you are, the NHL is flying out there."TV: 7:30 p.m. ET, FSN Detroit, ROOT (Pittsburgh)ABOUT THE PENGUINS (3-2-0): Although he was kept off the scoresheet for the first time this season on Wednesday, captain Sidney Crosby is a prime candidate to rebound versus the Red Wings. The reigning Hart Trophy winner collected two goals and an assist as Pittsburgh recorded five of six points versus Detroit last season (2-0-1). With the Penguins in the midst of playing three games in four days, backup goaltender Thomas Greiss is expected to make his season debut either Thursday or Saturday versus Nashville. ABOUT THE RED WINGS (3-1-2): While it has been flawless on the penalty kill, Detroit would be wise to provide a jolt to its ailing power play - which is just 2-for-24 on the season. "You want to do good out there," defenseman Niklas Kronwall said. "Of course, sometimes I think maybe you overanalyze things and you want to do the right thing, and that ends up with you thinking too much. Just go back to basics and keep it simple out there usually works."OVERTIME1. Detroit captain Henrik Zetterberg has scored in his last two overall contests and collected seven goals and five assists in 11 career meetings with Pittsburgh.2. Penguins RW Pascal Dupuis, who scored on Wednesday, sits two points shy of 400 for his career.3. Red Wings G Jimmy Howard owns a 3-0-1 record with a .930 save percentage in five career games versus Pittsburgh.PREDICTION: Red Wings 3, Penguins 2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Memori...<COL>The Ottawa Senators attempt to get back to matters on the ice Saturday, when they host the New Jersey Devils. Ottawa saw its contest against provincial-rival Toronto postponed on Wednesday after shooting broke out at the National War Memorial and Parliament, resulting in the death of a guard. Ottawa, in conjunction with the Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens, will honor the victims, as well as those who stopped the attacker, in a coordinated pregame ceremony.Ottawa enters the contest with a four-game winning streak but hasn't played since last Saturday's 3-2 triumph over Columbus. New Jersey shouldn't have any rust, although its frustration likely is building after suffering its 18th consecutive defeat in a shootout on Friday. Defenseman Eric Gelinas and Damien Brunner scored their respective first goals for the Devils, who dropped a 3-2 decision to Dallas to fall to 0-2-2 in their last four games.TV: 7 p.m. ET, MSG Plus 2 (New Jersey), RSN (Ottawa)ABOUT THE DEVILS (3-2-2): Although New Jersey's run of futility in the shootout extends back to March 15, 2013, Cory Schneider wasn't interested in dwelling on the latest setback. "One game, one shootout right now," Schneider said after his 35-save performance. "We're not thinking back to last year. This is a new year and we'll just move forward." Schneider has started every game this season for New Jersey, although coach Peter DeBoer didn't divulge if Scott Clemmensen would receive the nod on Saturday.ABOUT THE SENATORS (4-1-0): Captain Erik Karlsson scored versus the Blue Jackets to extend his point streak to four games and shares the team lead in goals (two) and points (four) with two other players. The defenseman also scored a goal and set up two others in Ottawa's 5-2 victory over New Jersey on Oct. 17, 2013 before netting the shootout winner in the Senators' 2-1 triumph on April 10. Clarke MacArthur, who also has two goals and four assists, is riding a three-game point streak.OVERTIME1. Ottawa G Craig Anderson boasts a 7-2-1 career mark with one shutout and a 2.05 goals-against average versus New Jersey.2. Brunner, who has scored and set up two goals in his last two games, has collected a tally and an assist in three meetings with the Senators.3. A moment of silence will take place prior to the game and all fans have been encouraged to wear red to honor Canada.PREDICTION: Senators 4, Devils 2Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

...<COL>Oklahoma City was going to struggle to score points with superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook out with injuries, but the depths of the club's current struggles are quite remarkable. The shorthanded Thunder hit the road again looking to find some answers when they visit Utah on Tuesday in the first of two away from home. Oklahoma City shot 29.4 percent while matching the lowest-scoring output in franchise history in Sunday's embarrassing 69-65 home loss to Houston.The Thunder have averaged 77.3 points over their last three losses and entered Monday's action last in the NBA in scoring (89.5) and 28th in shooting (42.2 percent). Utah is coming off a 2-3 road trip that included a handful of tight games before a 111-93 loss in Toronto on Saturday. Derrick Favors scored 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting but his teammates combined to shoot 37.5 percent from the floor as the Jazz faded in the second half.TV: 9 p.m. ET, FSN Oklahoma, ROOT Sports (Utah)ABOUT THE THUNDER (3-8): Among the few positives for Oklahoma City has been the progress of second-year center Steven Adams, who has teamed with backup Kendrick Perkins and power forward Serge Ibaka to give the squad some occasional nastiness along the frontline. Adams has 11 blocked shots over the last two games for a team that limits opponents to 36.1 points in the paint, ninth-fewest in the league. Adams' offensive game is rather pedestrian, but he has four double-digit scoring efforts already after securing just three in 81 games as a rookie.ABOUT THE JAZZ (4-7): While Favors was solid in the loss to Toronto and each of his fellow starters managed to score in double figures, the lack of depth was an issue once more for Utah, which received 23 points on 7-for-16 shooting from six substitutes. The Jazz's bench contributes an average of 25.5 points, which is 28th in the NBA. Only two reserves (Trevor Booker and Joe Ingles) reached double digits on the five-game trip, both netting exactly 10 points on just one occasion.BUZZER BEATERS 1. Ibaka is shooting 47.7 percent from the floor after posting a 53.6 percent mark or better in each of his first five seasons.2. Favors is 26-for-37 from the floor over a three-game span.3.

It was set to depart for Anchorage Sunday -- but Dyer didn’t follow that plan, choosing to make an unscheduled resupply stop.“Instead of going to Anchorage, he took a round trip and came back to Kodiak,” Schwarz said. “Instead of groceries, he got back to the boat with two cases of beer and a bottle of vodka and a pipe like you use to smoke dope.”After departing Kodiak with those purchases and grounding the craft, Schwarz said Dyer became drunk and belligerent, scaring Barrowcliff to the point where the deckhand locked himself inside a compartment, called police and waited half an hour for authorities to arrive.KPD officers ultimately boarded the Polar Bear, with assistance from the Kodiak harbormaster’s office.“Dyer was found to be highly intoxicated not realizing the vessel was aground,” police wrote. “Officers assisted Barrowcliff in dropping the anchors of the Polar Bear and removed Dyer, transporting him to land.”“They arrested (Dyer) and found the booze and the pipe in his room,” Schwarz said.Schwarz said he arrived in Kodiak to move the Polar Bear from Gull Island, only to ground it again himself in the process. He hopes to have the Polar Bear taken to Homer during a lull in 40-knot winds Wednesday for a full underwater inspection in clearer waters; so far, however, there aren’t any obvious signs of damage.“I built the boat myself about 24 years ago,” Schwarz said. “Nothing visible, and nothing leaking.”Although Schwarz described Dyer as generally a “very nice person,” he said Sunday’s incident will likely cost him his skipper's license. He said Dyer made $1,000 bail Tuesday afternoon and asked to sail on the Polar Bear as a mechanic -- a request Schwarz is taking seriously, due to his familiarity with the vessel."Instead of being a captain, he going to be a deckhand," Schwarz said.Kodiak police said Dyer was charged with three misdemeanors: DUI, reckless endangerment and fourth-degree assault.Copyright © 2014, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.

December is already off to a better start.
The Blue Jackets, with goals from left winger Matt Calvert and center Boone Jenner, beat ...<COL>The New York Knicks look to halt a four-game skid when they renew hostilities with the Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The Knicks welcomed back Carmelo Anthony to the lineup on Sunday after a two-game absence due to back spasms, but it wasn't enough as they fell 86-79 to the Miami Heat. New York will be glad to see the month of November disappear in the rearview mirror after going 3-13, which included an ugly seven-game losing streak. The Nets have fared a little better by winning six times in the last 30 days, but have dropped seven of nine to fall six games behind the Toronto Raptors at the top of the Atlantic Division. Brooklyn has been held below 100 points in seven of its last eight games, but did top the century mark in its victory over the Knicks on Nov. 7. The Nets are coming off a 102-84 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday and hope to turn things around by beating New York in consecutive meetings for the first time since the 2009-10 season. TV: 7:30 p.m. YES (Brooklyn), MSG (New York) ABOUT THE NETS (6-9): Brooklyn struggled from the floor in the loss to the Bulls, shooting 37.2 percent - including 2-of-14 from 3-point range - with Joe Johnson limited to a season-low three points. "We've got to fight, battle and stay after it," coach Lionel Hollins told reporters. "It's just the consistency here, getting everybody on the same page." Bojan Bogdanovic was one of the lone bright spots against Chicago as the rookie scored a team-high 13 points after netting eight in his previous two games. ABOUT THE KNICKS (4-14): Anthony led the way against the Heat with 31 points, but missed five of his six attempts from beyond the arc and is 4-of-15 in his last three outings. "I don't like to lose, this is not a great feeling," Anthony told reporters. "We are going to be frustrated that we are losing games that we feel like we should be winning." Amar'e Stoudemire - who scored 19 points and grabbed 12 rebounds versus Miami to record his third double-double - has finished in double figures in six of his last seven games. BUZZER BEATERS1. The Knicks have lost 11 of their last 13 games.2. Brooklyn has not beaten a team with a current winning record this season. 3.

Corey Perry sent the Ducks away from Honda Center on a high note, notching two assists before scoring the decisive goal in the shootout in a 5-4 victory over Philadelphia on Wednesday. The former Hart Trophy recipient also made his presence felt in Anaheim's first meeting with the Wild by netting the eventual winning tally in a 2-1 triumph on Oct. 17.Jason Zucker scored the Wild's lone goal in that contest and also tallied in a 2-1 win over Montreal on Wednesday. Minnesota is riding high with a 7-2-1 mark in its last 10 games overall and an 8-2-1 record at home, although the team has heard its fair share of jeering in relation to its sputtering power play (7-for-78, nine percent). "It doesn't help," Zach Parise told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune of the crowd's reaction. "They're frustrated, and I understand that. And they have a right to be frustrated. We're frustrated, and then when we get booed, we get more frustrated, and then it snowballs."TV: 8 p.m. ET, Prime Ticket (Anaheim), FSN North Plus (Minnesota)ABOUT THE DUCKS (16-6-5): Veteran defenseman Eric Brewer is expected to miss four to six weeks with a broken bone in his foot that he sustained while playing in his second game after being acquired from Tampa Bay. Anaheim's ever-changing blue line saw the return of Clayton Stoner against the Flyers after he missed five contests with the mumps, while fellow defenseman Mark Fistric also was activated from injured reserve. As for positives, blue-liner Sami Vatanen is enjoying an offensive explosion this season, collecting a career-high seven goals while his 21 points match his previous best set over 48 games in 2013-14. ABOUT THE WILD (14-9-1): Coach Mike Yeo is keeping an open mind about the availability of Ryan Suter as the stud defenseman deals with the mumps. "I'm not even ready to rule him out for (Friday)," Yeo told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune regarding Suter, who has led the league in ice time over the last two seasons - in addition to 2014-15 as well. "Marco (Scandella) missed two games with this and 'Bally' (Keith Ballard) missed eight games with it, so it affects people differently." Like the Ducks, the Wild have been hit hard by the virus, which has sidelined defensemen Jonas Brodin (seven games) and Christian Folin (five games).OVERTIME1. Anaheim captain Ryan Getzlaf has scored two goals and set up four others in his last three games and has recorded 31 points (eight goals, 23 assists) in 33 meetings with Minnesota.2. While their power play is struggling, the Wild have yielded just two goals while short-handed over their last 10 games.3.

Penguins past the reeling Ottawa Sen...<COL>PITTSBURGH -- A game between a pair of desperate teams came down to the final two minutes.That's when defenseman Christian Ehrhoff stepped up, netting the game-winner to lead the short-handed Pittsburgh Penguins past the reeling Ottawa Senators 3-2 on Saturday at Consol Energy Center."I liked the way we pushed at the end for the winning goal," Ehrhoff said. "We weren't satisfied with tying the game. We really pushed hard, and I think we deserved that goal at the end."Ehrhoff scored his second goal of the season for the Penguins, who rebounded from a shutout loss on Thursday, while playing without four of their top-six wingers.Center Evgeni Malkin scored his 13th and 14th goals of the season, the second his 96th career power-play goal, surpassing Rick Kehoe for fourth place on the team's all-time list. Captain Sidney Crosby snapped a three-game point drought with an assist on the game-winner as Pittsburgh defeated Ottawa for the fifth time in seven games."It's always important to have a rebound game," Penguins coach Mike Johnston said. "We didn't feel that Vancouver game was good for us. Everybody was anxious to get back at it and play again."Center David Legwand scored his fourth goal and center Mika Zibanejad his fifth for the Senators, who dropped their fifth straight, suffering their seventh loss in eight games. It was the Senators' sixth one-goal defeat in their last nine games."We're doing a lot of good things that enable us to win games," Senators goaltender Craig Anderson said. "It can be frustrating at times, but if we keep focusing on the process, and focusing on the way we're playing, the results will turn around for us."Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 27 shots to earn his 15th win. Anderson made 30 saves in goal for the Senators.Ehrhoff broke a 2-2 tie, sending a booming slap shot past Anderson. Crosby sent a cross-ice pass to a wide-open Ehrhoff, who had time to wind up before ripping a slap shot past Anderson."(Ottawa) missed a coverage on the weak side and I found a seam," Ehrhoff said. "I just had a lot of time, picked a corner and it went right where I wanted to put it."The injury-depleted Penguins played again without a number of top-line regulars, notably right winger Patric Hornqvist, who left Pittsburgh's 3-0 loss Thursday because of a possible concussion.Pittsburgh already was without right winger Pascal Dupuis (blood clots) for the season and left winger Chris Kunitz, out at least two weeks because of a fractured foot. The three own a combined 26 goals and 56 points.The Penguins also played without defenseman Kris Letang (groin), right winger Beau Bennett (lower body) and defenseman Robert Bortuzzo, who finished his two-game suspension for a hard hit on New Jersey Devils forward Jaromir Jagr.The Penguins added to their roster Friday, trading defensive prospect Philip Samuelsson to Arizona for forward Rob Klinkhammer, who spent 15 games with Ottawa in 2011-12 and was in the lineup on Saturday."We competed, we worked hard, and that's what you have to do when you're missing guys," Crosby said. "When you have guys out of the lineup, everybody has to make sure that they're desperate and competing."It has been the same story for the struggling Senators, who lost both legs of a recent home-and-home series against the New York Islanders by one goal, including an emotional retirement tribute to former captain Daniel Alfredsson.Reliable defenseman Marc Methot recently returned after missing 24 games because of a back injury as did four-time 30-goal scorer Bobby Ryan (broken finger), but the Senators lost by one goal for the fourth time in five games."We're angry that we lost this game," Senators coach Paul MacLean said. "It was a game that was certainly winnable."Tempers escalated early when Penguins center Zach Sill leveled Senators center Kyle Turris with an open-ice shoulder check.Sill was assessed a five-minute penalty for interference, a fighting major -- after a tussle with right winger Alex Chiasson -- and a game misconduct.The action came one minute after Malkin was whistled for roughing, giving the Senators a 5-on-3 power-play for 45 seconds.Ottawa squandered the early opportunity and Pittsburgh netted the opening goal.Malkin, on a breakaway from the penalty box, slipped the puck past Anderson, while sliding to the ice, giving Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead.Ottawa tied it with a power-play goal only 1:13 into the second period. Legwand caught a piece of defenseman Erik Karlsson's shot from the point, and the puck floated over Fleury's shoulder.No email address was supplied by.

So, too, has the violence that's marred the region for decades.Recent incidents have stirred fears in Israel of a return to 2002, then in the midst of a second intifada, or armed uprising, when the Israeli government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks.On Monday alone, an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a Tel Aviv street while three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same West Bank hitchhiking post where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year. This comes after several incidents in which drivers ran into crowds on busy streets.So does this all mean a third intifada is coming, if it's not already here?No -- or, at least, not yet, according to experts.Much has changed, they point out, since Arafat's death. It's harder than ever to get from the West Bank into Israel, especially with explosives and such. There has been no call to arms by the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank; instead, analysts say, there has been significant cooperation with Israeli authorities to ferret out potential attackers. And there haven't been anything close yet to the coordinated, large-scale attacks in Israel like those of the early 2000s.As retired former Israeli National Security Adviser Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror pointed out Tuesday, what's happening now "falls far from" the first two intifadas, as far as the overall threat to Israel.But one thing that hasn't changed is the deep frustration among Palestinians. Now, as was the case over a decade ago, many still harbor steep distrust at Israeli authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough."The nature of these movements is that spark could ignite the tinder," said Jon B. Alterman, the head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Middle East program. "... And once it starts moving, you have no idea where it's going to go."Voids in Palestinian hope, leadershipArafat is still considered a hero among many Palestinians, as the scenes around the West Bank commemorating his death on Tuesday showed.This was a man, according to his supporters, who stood up to Israel. This was a man who rallied Palestinians to fight. This was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent Palestinian state.Not only is there no more Arafat, but the idea of a unified Palestinian front is a thing of the past as well. Arafat's former group, Fatah, now controls the West Bank under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while rival Hamas is in charge of Gaza."You have an unprecedented division," said the Brookings Institution's Khaled Elgindy, contrasting that to what he views as Israeli leadership that's become more conservative and less willing to compromise. "It's a much weaker leadership than we've ever seen."The lack of a unifying figure, like Arafat, has led to a "complete alienation of the people from leadership," said Ingrid Jaradat Gassner of the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem. Not only don't they have a person to rally around, there's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many Palestinians."People really have no expectation, no hope, no perspective in terms of their being any chance that comes through a political initiative," Gassner told CNN from her home in Bethlehem. "So what we have is an outburst of frustration."What there is not, however, is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against Israelis -- which was unlike, many say, happened during the second intifada.In some ways, that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel, only the attacker may know what will happen next."This is a huge problem because there is no intelligence," Amidror told reporters Tuesday on a call coordinated by the Israel Project. "Someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying, 'Today, I'll kill some Israelis.'"There is no organization behind it," the former Israeli national security adviser said, noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack. "... I don't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual (like that)."Israeli policies have an impactWhat's happening and what's not happening, if you're talking about major attacks, is a testament to Israel's policies as well.A lot has changed since what Israelis called the "Passover massacre," when a man walked into a seaside hotel in spring 2002 and blew himself up, killing 30 civilians.For one, a wall -- or a fence, depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the West Bank and Israel, making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons.No email address was supplied by.

Pollock and Bronson Arroyo were too much to overcome in a 98-loss season that cost general manager Kevin Towers and manager Kirk Gibson their positions.Tony La Russa, brought in in May as the chief baseball officer, hired general manager Dave Stewart and director of baseball operations De Jon Watson as his front office team -- with an accent on team -- in the final week of the season, and the crew immediately went to work on identifying Gibson's replacement. The D-backs won the NL West with 94 victories in Gibson's first year in 2011 but regressed thereafter.Ace and 2013 All-Star Corbin suffered a season-ending elbow injury that necessitated Tommy John surgery in the middle of spring training, veteran Arroyo underwent Tommy John surgery in July, and late-inning reliever David Hernandez also missed the season after Tommy John surgery in March. It left the D-backs with a thin rotation, and they suffered. The D-backs (64-98) had the worst record in the league and the fifth-worst ERA (4.26)."Let's be honest," interim manager Alan Trammell said on the final day of the regular season. "One hundred years ago, today, one hundred years from now, pitching is the No. 1 component in baseball. Always has and always will be. Never change. Without it, you can't win. End of story. You need others parts, but that has to be it."Dave Stewart, an ace of La Russa's Bash Brothers teams of the last 1980s in Oakland, wants to add a frontline starter this winter, although the top-tier free agents such as Jon Lester, Max Scherzer and James Shields likely will price themselves out of the D-backs' range, even though their payroll is expected to remain in the nine-figure range after topping out a franchise record $112 million at the start of 2014. The team has an excess of middle infielders, but Stewart said a trade is unlikely."I'm not going to be going into the market looking to actively trade one of our middle infielders," Stewart said. "If it makes sense for our ball club, I'm going to do what's best for the ball club. We need frontline starting pitching. If it allows us an opportunity to get that, we'll have to examine that. We're going to try to maintain what we have. We are going to try to maintain our minor league system."Maybe you add a piece this year and you add a piece next year and you get where you want to be."The D-backs lost more player-games to injury than any team other than Texas this season, and Stewart said he believes that with health will come a return to normalcy. All-Star Paul Goldschmidt missed two months, slugger Mark Trumbo missed 11 weeks and center fielder A.J. Pollock missed three months. The offense scored 615 runs, 25th in the league, and should be better next season. But pitching is the key. NL Central winner St. Louis (90-72) scored only 619 runs.The loss of playing time for some meant instant immersion for others, and outfielders David Peralta and Ender Inciarte thrived when given the chance. The two finished 1-2 in batting average among NL rookies with at least 325 at-bats, Peralta hitting .286 and Inciarte .278. Peralta, a converted pitcher, had nine triples. Inciarte had 19 stolen bases and 10 assists.La Russa expects the payroll to be in the $80 million-$110 million range, and that suits him fine."If you have a hundred million dollar payroll, you don't have a complaint," La Russa said. "I never had one in St. Louis. That's plenty of money to compete with and win with. The key is, can you be smart with it. If you have young guys they are not as expensive. The thing you try to avoid is winning the PR offseason battle for the fans. We're going to try to assess value. We're fortunate with the performance of guys like Ender and David, there is less urgency to go out and get a big bat of a leadoff hitter that cost a lot of money."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Bianca Cross, one of the officers who responded shortly after midnight to the single-vehicle crash, said high speed appeared to be a factor. Officers aren’t yet sure whether the man driving the vehicle was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, which was reported to APD at about 12:50 a.m."They went outside to find out what that noise was, and then they discovered this vehicle had wrecked in front of their house," Cross said. "Right now it appears to be a single-vehicle accident, with one person inside that was transported to the hospital."The crash came about a block east of Rabbit Creek Road's intersection with Pollock Drive in South Anchorage. The name of the driver and the make and model of the vehicle were not immediately available.APD spokeswoman Jennifer Castro says the man’s injuries were not life-threatening. The accident closed Rabbit Creek Road in both directions for more than three hours.Dozens of police and fire responders were working Sunday morning at the scene. Parts of the vehicle could be seen among the trees.Neighbors at the scene said they heard a loud crash. Some helped emergency crews, who extricated the driver and took him to a local hospital.Editor's note: An initial version of this story that included an incorrect first name for APD Sgt.

Steelhammer inte...<COL>PHOENIX -- Arizona first baseman Mark Trumbo hit two home runs, and his tiebreaking three-run shot in the seventh inning lifted the Diamondbacks to a 5-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night at Chase Field.The Cardinals (89-72) failed in their first chance to clinch the National League Central title, but they still lead Pittsburgh (88-73) by one game with one to play.Trumbo followed one-out singles by center fielder A.J. Pollock and right fielder David Peralta with a homer to left field to break a tie at 2 off right-hander Seth Maness (6-4) in the seventh inning.Trumbo has six homers and 17 RBIs in his last 11 games, with two two-homer games. He has 14 homers this season after missing 11 weeks with a stress fracture in his left foot.Right-hander Randall Delgado (4-4) pitched three innings of one-hit relief and right-hander Addison Reed posted his 32nd save with a 1-2-3 ninth inning.Third baseman Matt Carpenter had two hits and scored a run for the Cardinals, who are to start 20-game winner Adam Wainwright against the Diamondbacks on Sunday.The Pirates are scheduled start Gerrit Cole (11-5) at Cincinnati in a game that is scheduled to begin three hours earlier.St. Louis did not get a runner past second base after scoring twice in the second inning to tie the score at 2.David Peralta had three hits, including his eighth homer of the season, and scored twice for Arizona (64-97), playing its second game under interim manager Alan Trammell after Kirk Gibson was fired Friday.Pollock had two hits and left fielder Ender Inciarte singled to extend his hitting streak to 15 games.Cardinals starter Lance Lynn gave up two runs and nine hits in six innings. He struck out six.Peralta and Trumbo hit back-to-back homers with two outs in the first inning for a quick 2-0 lead.St. Louis tied it in the third inning off Arizona left-hander Wade Miley, who gave up two runs and six hits in five innings.Carpenter and right fielder Randal Grichuk singled before left fielder Matt Holliday walked to load the bases. Shortstop Jhonny Peralta hit a sacrifice fly to drive in one, and Grichuk scored from second base when the next batter, first baseman Matt Adams, struck out but reached safely on a wild pitch.Neither team had another runner past second base in the first six innings. Holliday left in the last of the sixth with flu-like symptoms, when Peter Bourjos entered.NOTES: St. Louis RHP Adam Wainwright will start Sunday whether the Cardinals have clinched the NL Central or not, manager Mike Matheny said. Wainwright (20-9, 2.38 ERA) is in line to start Game 1 of a potential NLDS on Oct. 3. ... Arizona 1B Paul Goldschmidt took batting practice Saturday for the first time since he suffered a season-ending broken finger when he was struck by a pitch Aug. 1. "I think we would all admit, No. 1, how much we missed him," acting manager Alan Trammell said. "Obviously, that has hurt us tremendously." ... Trammell opted to manage the final three games of the season even after being fired along with manager Kirk Gibson on Friday afternoon. "The game is bigger than any of us and I felt that I could finish this thing out, as difficult as it is," said Trammell, who had been Gibson's bench coach since Gibson's first full season in 2011. ...

Randall Delgado (4-4) struck out four in three scoreless innings of relief before Addison Reed got the final three outs for his 32nd save.Seth Maness (6-4) served up Trumbo's decisive blast after Lance Lynn gave up two runs over six innings for the Cardinals, who remained one game ahead of Pittsburgh with one to play. Matt Carpenter collected two hits and Jhonny Peralta had a sacrifice fly.Lynn got a break when Ender Inciarte was thrown out trying to stretch a double into a triple in the first, which loomed especially large when David Peralta lined a shot into the seats in right and Trumbo followed with a deep blast to left-center. St. Louis loaded the bases in the third on a pair of singles and a walk before Jhonny Peralta plated one run on a sacrifice fly and Randal Grichuk dashed home from second base on a wild pitch to tie it.The Diamondbacks forged ahead against St. Louis' bullpen in the seventh, with A.J. Pollock and David Peralta producing back-to-back singles off Maness before Trumbo untied it by lacing a pitch into the seats in left to make it 5-2.

Not giving up a lead like that, but giving up a couple runs and we have to fight our way back into it. I do say, when things happen and it looks like the air gets kicked out of it, that isn't the case. They just keep playing the game. That's served us well so far, and hopefully as we move ahead. That was a roller coaster."The Cardinals led 6-2 before Arizona tied the game with a run in the seventh inning and three in the eighth, but left-hander Marco Gonzalez (4-2) pitched a scoreless ninth to send the game into extra innings.St. Louis first baseman Matt Adams doubled off right fielder Brett Jackson's glove to open the 10th against Evan Marshall (4-4) before Peralta lined a single to center, his third hit of the game, to score pinch runner Daniel Descalso."He threw me the pitch I was looking for," said Peralta said, who hit a sinking fastball from Marshall.The Cardinals (89-71) remained one game ahead of Pittsburgh (88-72) with two games to play. The Cardinals would host a one-game playoff Monday if the teams tie for the division lead.Peralta also had a two-run double in a three-run sixth inning as St. Louis took a 4-2 lead that grew to four runs in the seventh inning.Adams, left fielder Jon Jay and second baseman Kolten Wong had two hits apiece for the Cardinals.Left fielder Ender Inciarte had four hits, scored a run and drove in the tying run in a three-run eighth inning for Arizona (63-97), which has the worst record of the majors and by virtue of the loss has the No. 1 pick in the 2015 amateur draft.Right-hander Trevor Rosenthal picked up his 45th save.The D-backs fired manager Kirk Gibson and bench coach Alan Trammell before the game, although Trammell managed the game Friday."It has been an interesting day to say the least," Trammell said.Arizona got five hits off right-hander Pat Neshek to tie the game in the eighth inning, although Inciarte's double that tied the game was the only hard-hit ball."It seemed like every ball was out of their reach," Neshek said. "That's the game of baseball. It drives you crazy. That makes me so happy. The guys picked me up. That was such a big game to win."Catcher Miguel Montero, third baseman Jake Lamb and second baseman Nick Ahmed singled to load the bases with one out in the eighth before shortstop Didi Gregorius dropped a single into center field to drive in two runs.Inciarte then hit a two-out, ground-rule double to left field to drive in Ahmed and tie the game. Gregorius would have scored easily, but the ball hit the warning track and hopped over the fence. Neshek has given up nine of his 14 earned runs this season in his last 12 outings."If that happened for them, they were supposed to win the game," Inciarte said of the fact that his hit bounced into the stands.Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 14 games when he singled to lead off a two-run first inning off Michael Wacha ahead of walks to center fielder A.J. Pollock and right fielder David Peralta.First baseman Mark Trumbo drove in a run with sacrifice fly, and catcher Miguel Montero singled in a run for a 2-0 Arizona lead.St. Louis scored the next six runs, with Jhonny Peralta's two-run double in a four-run sixth inning the big blow.NOTES: Arizona bench coach Alan Trammell will manage the final three games of the season, chief baseball officer Tony La Russa said, even though both Trammell and manager Kirk Gibson were fired Friday afternoon. Gibson was 353-375 in his four-plus seasons as manager, including the NL West title in his first full season in 2011. ... Arizona 2B Chris Owings (left shoulder) was a late scratch in the starting lineup. He was replaced by 2B Nick Ahmed. ... St. Louis manager Mike Matheny is the fifth manager to lead his team to the playoffs in his first three seasons, joining Detroit's Hughie Jennings (1907-09), the Yankees' Ralph Houk (1991-93), Houston's Larry Dierker (1997-99) and Minnesota's Ron Gardenhire (2002-04).Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

at Yankee Stadium.
"That's probably as good as it gets," he said Friday.
So why is Jeter planning to serve as the Yankees' de...<COL>PHOENIX -- The removal of manager Kirk Gibson with three games left in the season was not a reflection of the record, chief baseball officer Tony La Russa said, but a continuation of a theme started when La Russa came aboard to oversee baseball operations in May."We just decided that being fresh, starting fresh with not just the upstairs leadership team but downstairs, is more consistent with what we are doing as an organization," La Russa said Friday.The firings of Gibson and bench coach and long-time friend Alan Trammell were announced 15 minutes before a press conference to introduce new general manager Dave Stewart and new director of baseball operations De Jon Watson.The D-backs (63-96) entered the final series of the regular season against St. Louis with the worst record in the major leagues, although at least some of that can be attributed to season-ending injuries to No. 1 starter Patrick Corbin and in-season injuries to Paul Goldschmidt, Mark Trumbo, A.J. Pollock and Bronson Arroyo that caused all to miss extended time. The D-backs have 1,370 player-days on the disabled list this season, second to Texas in the majors."So it is really not a reflection on them," La Russa said of Gibson and Trammell. "I know that sounds a little hollow, but I'm always sincere when I am serious. The situation was unfair enough that the losses piled up, but we are making a fresh start.It made sense in the end to start fresh with the manager."Stewart said Triple-A Reno manager Phil Nevin, Double-A Mobile manager Andy Green and D-backs hitting coach and former Mobile manager Turner Ward are in-house candidates to replace Gibson, who was 353-375 in his four-plus seasons."We are looking for somebody who can lead this club, not just in the short term but the long term," Stewart said. "There are some good names out there. We've got veteran guys who are out there that are available, and we've got some young stars that are actually within our system. We definitely are going to look at those guys, but the outside guys we are going to take a little bit more time and really, really do a good job of who we bring in here."Gibson, the D-backs' bench coach since 2007, took over as manager in July 2010, when A.J. Hinch was fired. Gibson led the D-backs to the NL West title at 94-68 in 2011. The team was 81-81 in 2012 and 2013 before fading this season."I am extremely appreciative for this opportunity and I had a great experience with the Diamondbacks," Gibson said in a prepared statement. "I know we had a tough year and people will look at this as a negative, but we accomplished a lot of good things here. I told the team that I have nothing but the utmost respect for this organization and the people I've met along the way."Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

The 11th win is a career high.Shortstop Didi Gregorius, who had three doubles, and center fielder A.J. Pollock, who added two singles and a double, led the Arizona offense.After Collmenter exited, Diamondbacks relievers Oliver Perez (one-third of an inning), Evan Marshall (1 1/3 innings) and Will Harris (one inning) blanked the Twins the rest of the way.Minnesota starter Ricky Nolasco (5-12) allowed five runs on nine hits and a walk in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out five.Arizona opened the fifth inning with three consecutive hits, including an RBI double by Gregorius. Left fielder Ender Inciarte's ground out plated another run, and Gregorius scored on a wild pitch by Nolasco.First baseman Mark Trumbo capped the inning with a two-run homer to the opposite field, his 12th blast of the year to make it 5-1.A walk to catcher Miguel Montero was the end of the line for Nolasco.Twins left fielder Chris Herrmann hit an RBI single in the third inning, and pinch hitter Josmil Pinto added a run-scoring hit in the seventh.NOTES: Twins OF Aaron Hicks was back in the lineup after missing two games due to a stiff lower back. ...

Eduardo Escobar was hit by a pitch, moved up on singles by Santana and Brian Dozier, and scored on Plouffe's sacrifice fly in the second.A.J. Pollock and Jake Lamb each singled to open the sixth before moving up on a double steal, but Hughes permitted only one run on Peralta's sacrifice fly. Hughes retired the final nine batters he faced before 66-minute rain delay and Jared Burton worked around a two-out double to notch his third save in the ninth inning.GAME NOTEBOOK: Minnesota 1B Joe Mauer sat out the series finale with a right elbow contusion, sustained when he was hit by a pitch in Tuesday's game, and is day-to-day. … Arizona C Bobby Wilson made his first start since Sept. 30, 2012 when he was with the Los Angeles Angels and went 1-for-3. … Hughes become the first Minnesota pitcher to reach the 16-win plateau since Carl Pavano recorded 17 victories in 2010.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

Gregorius would have scored easily, but the ball hit the warning track and hopped over the fence. Neshek has given up nine of his 14 earned runs this season in his last 12 outings.Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 14 games when he singled to lead off a two-run first inning ahead of walks to center fielder A.J. Pollock and right fielder David Peralta.First baseman Mark Trumbo drove in a run with sacrifice fly, and catcher Miguel Montero singled in a run for a 2-0 Arizona lead.St. Louis cut the deficit to 2-1 in the second inning when catcher Yadier Molina grounded into a double play after Adams walked and took third on Jhonny Peralta's single.St. Louis knocked out Arizona starter Trevor Cahill with a three-run sixth inning. Third baseman Matt Carpenter, Jay and Adams singled to load the bases before Jhonny Peralta doubled to deep center field to drive in two. Molina's sacrifice fly made it 4-2.NOTES: Arizona bench coach Alan Trammell is to manage the final three games of the season, chief baseball officer Tony La Russa said, even though both Trammell and manager Kirk Gibson were fired Friday afternoon. Gibson was 353-375 in his four-plus seasons as manager, including the NL West title in his first full season in 2011. ... Arizona 2B Chris Owings (left shoulder) was a late scratch in the starting lineup. He was replaced by 2B Nick Ahmed. ... St. Louis manager Mike Matheny is the fifth manager to lead his team to the playoffs in his first three seasons, joining Detroit's Hughie Jennings(1907-09), the Yankees' Ralph Houk (1991-93), Houston's Larry Dierker (1997-99) and Minnesota's Ron Gardenhire (2002-04). ...

But don't judge a boo...<COL>The classic plateau de fruits de mer, literally meaning "platter of the fruits of the sea," is a showy affair: a dazzling tiered tower of crab, lobster, clams, oysters, snails and every other bivalve and  shellfish under the sea. But don't judge a book by its cover -- just  'cause it looks fancy doesn't mean you can't create the effect in your  own home.Save yourself a trip to the local French brasserie or seafood  restaurant and impress your guests (or just yourself) with these  tower-building tips on the half shell from Ben Pollinger, the executive  chef of Michelin-starred Oceana.1. Don't be "shrimpy" on the size"When creating the ultimate raw bar, it's a must to include shrimp  cocktail, chilled lobster, clams and oysters on the half shell. From  there, the possibilities are endless.I also always include Alaskan King crab legs (you can use snow crab  legs or Peekytoe crabmeat if Alaskan King are not readily available).  Taking it up a notch, add some chilled steamed mussels and a type of  snail - periwinkles or whelks, they are easier to deal with than you  think. And, if you really want that wow factor, include some small dishes of ceviches or tartares with vibrant citrus flavors.Every raw platter needs basic cocktail sauce, it's such an iconic  flavor, that alongside some some other tasty dipping sauces, either  store-bought or homemade, will really jazz up your raw bar plate.Something mayonnaise-based like a tangy roasted pepper aïoli goes  great with chilled cooked shellfish, while a slightly herb-thickened  vinaigrette tastes delicious on anything. Remember to include a  mignonette for the oysters -- you need acid, spice and pungency -- my  suggestion is to change up the classic with a seaweed-infused vinegar,  crushed chilis and some shallots."2. Let's get cracking"First thing first, don't put up a platter without pre-cracked claws  unless everyone will be sitting down at a table -- it's like putting your  oysters and clams on the plate unopened. That said, you can use a fancy  shellfish cracker, but a good old basic metal handheld nutcracker works  great.Put the thickest part of the claw in between the teeth, bear down  then compress without squeezing too hard so you don't crush the meat -  only crack the shell. If you've done this right you will have two  pieces, pull the shell off one side then use the cocktail fork to pull  the meat out of the other."3. Old school East Coast/West Coast (oyster) rivalry --it's not just for rap music"There will always be aficionados of one coast or the other. Personally,  I'm into the East Coast myself. I like the brininess and firmness.West Coast tend to be a little softer but plumper, less briny, and  have a cucumber-melon kind of flavor. I have found a great new West  Coast oyster, the Stellar Bay Gold from British Columbia, Canada. All  oysters can be tumbled in the shell to break the growing lip, which  causes the cup to become deeper and the oyster meatier. These guys take  it to the extreme. The cup is almost as deep as it is long - a great  oyster.Some of my favorite East Coasters, which I bring in direct from the farmers, are Glidden Points from Maine, Moonstones from Rhode Island, East Dennis from Massachusetts. New York has winners too - Widow's Hole, Fisher's Island and the Naked Cowboy.But the king of them all is the Belon. Technically it has to be from  France to be a Belon but they do have some of this species in Maine.  It's got a great full flavor with metallic notes.When buying oysters,  be sure to ask your fishmonger how they are stored. Oysters should be  stored in a container that allows for melted ice to drain away, covered  in ice and topped with seaweed, wet newspaper or wet kitchen towels. The  oysters need to be kept cold and humid and not allowed to be stored  cold and dry.Be sure to also ask if they are wet-stored, particularly if you are  on the East Coast and the oysters are West Coast. Wet-storage is when  the oysters are harvested then held in sea water tanks in a central  location, generally to make the harvesting and shipping process more  predictable. It doesn't hurt the oysters, but I believe it causes them  to lose their 'merroir' -- the taste of the sea from which they came  (much like the term 'terroir' is used in wine to indicate the flavor characteristics picked up from a wine's growing location).The merroir is special because it contains some of the sea water from  where the oyster grew and wet-stored oysters will lose that. After some  time in a tank, two oysters from two different places will come to  taste the same."4. The wild card"Break out the caviar if you want to impress -- and you can do so without breaking the bank.  Find some great farmed American caviar, particularly from the hackleback  (aka shovelnose) sturgeon or the white sturgeon (aka transmontanous).  These are great choices, sustainable and affordable.Place the chilled tin right on the ice with a mother-of-pearl or horn  spoon (available where you buy the caviar) as metal spoons can impart a  taste. Keep it simple, if you don't want to buy or make blinis, then  you can put out some unsalted crackers and some crème fraiche."5. Cocktail complements"There's the classic oyster wine from the Loire Valley in France, Sèvre et Maine -- it can't be beat. Chenin blanc from Washington state is a great alternative, and you can't go wrong with Champagne.Premake a few oyster shooters to really jazz it up. Place a shucked  oyster in a tall shot glass, half a shot of vodka and a little fruit  purée like melon, apple or cherry."Copyright 2012 byCNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Pollock also had a double among three hits and Ender Inciarte went 2-for-5 with an RBI for the Diamondbacks, who also ended a six-game slide overall by scoring five times in the fifth inning. Josh Collmenter (11-8) allowed two runs, five hits, one walk and struck out five over 6 1/3 frames to register his career high in victories.Chris Herrmann and Josmil Pinto each knocked in a run for the Twins, who lost their third straight and dropped to 7-11 in interleague play. Ricky Nolasco (5-12) yielded five runs - all in the fifth - and nine hits over 4 2/3 innings to increase his winless streak to nine games.Herrmann's two-out RBI single opened the scoring in the third inning, but singles by Jake Lamb (two hits) and Chris Owings set the table for Arizona in the fifth. Gregorius doubled home a run, a groundout by Inciarte and a wild pitch brought in two more, and Trumbo capped the uprising with his two-run blast into the right-field seats.Kurt Suzuki doubled to lead off the seventh for Minnesota and came home to trim the lead to 5-2 when Pinto chopped an RBI single to right as a pinch hitter. Aaron Hill doubled for his second hit of the contest in the eighth and scored on a ground out by Owings to restore a four-run lead for the Diamondbacks.GAME NOTEBOOK: Inciarte extended his hitting streak to 11 games and is 16-for-45 during that span. … Minnesota All-Star 1B Joe Mauer and 2B Brian Dozier, who leads the Twins in homers with 21, were both rested. … The Diamondbacks have not committed an error in their last eight games.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

It showed again Wednesday.Duffy hit a two-run, tiebreaking single in the top of the ninth inning to lift the Giants to a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday at Chase Field, pulling San Francisco within two games of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West race."It feels good. It gives you confidence," said Duffy, who spent most of the season at Double-A Richmond. "When he shows confidence in you, it gives you confidence in yourself. I think that's helped me relax, knowing I'm not the only one who has confidence in myself."Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval walked to open the ninth inning off right-hander Addison Reed (1-6) and took second on a one-out single by shortstop Brandon Crawford, who tied a career high with four hits.Pinch hitter Brandon Belt walked to load the bases and bring up Duffy, who lined a single to center on a 3-2 slider."He's shown great poise up there," Bochy said. "He has good discipline. He has the composure you like as a pinch hitter. He has a simple swing, a short swing. He's not a guy who tries to get big up there."Duffy, who has 12 hits this season, is 4-for-10 as a pinch hitter. "Typically I try to be aggressive," Duffy said of his pinch-hit approach. "You might get one pitch to hit."Belt, who also contributed off the bench, made his first appearance since Aug. 6 after missing time due to concussion symptoms.Crawford hit a double and three singles and scored twice as the Giants (84-68) won for the sixth time in nine games.Catcher Tuffy Gosewisch had a career-high three hits, and center fielder A.J. Pollock had two hits and scored a run for the Diamondbacks (62-90), who won three of their previous four.Sergio Romo (6-4) pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Santiago Casilla struck out two in the ninth for his 17th save.The Giants have a three-game weekend series against the Padres in San Diego before playing the division-leading Dodgers (86-66) in a three-game series that starts Monday in Los Angeles.As the Giants' game started in Arizona, Colorado scored eight runs in the first inning against the Dodgers en route to a 16-2 victory.Reed pitched or heated up in the bullpen five of the past six games, Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said."He just didn't have it today," Gibson said.San Francisco left-hander Madison Bumgarner gave up two runs in six innings but did not get a decision. Bumgarner, who is attempting to become the Giants' first 20-game winner since John Burkett (22) and Bill Swift (21) in 1993, has 18 victories with two scheduled starts remaining."That was big for us today to pull this one out," Bumgarner said.Arizona left-hander Andrew Chafin, making his second major league start, gave up three hits and two runs in six innings. He walked four and struck out two."I have to work on my command a little bit," Chafin said. "I have to cut down on those walks. It's all about fine-tuning mechanics."Left fielder Ender Inciarte also has two hits for Arizona.Giants catcher Andrew Susac walked with two outs in the second inning and scored on Crawford's double to left-center field. Crawford has a career-high 65 RBIs.Chafin tied it in the last of the second with his first major league hit, a single to right field that drove in right fielder Cody Ross from third. Ross walked and went to third on a single by Gosewisch.Crawford singled and scored to make it 2-1 in the fifth inning. He took second on a wild pitch and scored after two sacrifice bunts, the second by left fielder Gregor Blanco.Pollock tripled with one out in the fifth inning and scored while Susac threw out first baseman Mark Trumbo after a strikeout in the dirt to make it 2-2.NOTES: San Francisco CF Angel Pagan underwent an MRI exam on his lower back Wednesday morning. "Basically, he's inflamed that nerve again, and we have to get it calmed down," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We'll take a look at the MRI and see where we're at." Pagan, who missed the Arizona series with the injury, has played only 95 games this season because of back and wrist injuries. ... Giants OF Mike Morse (strained oblique) missed his 15th consecutive game since getting hurt during batting practice Sept. 1. ... Arizona stacked its lineup with right-handed hitters against Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner, with C Tuffy Gosewisch and SS Nick Ahmed starting in place of C Miguel Montero and SS Didi Gregorius, both left-handed hitters.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

If the ball pass (into) the stands, we win,'" Rosario said of his homer."A terrible slider, a hanging slider," said Reed, who blew his sixth save in 37 chances. "Probably higher than belt high. I had been wild before tonight. Then I felt my command was finally there and made one mistake to Rosario."Pinch-hitter Corey Dickerson led off the ninth with an opposite-field single on a 1-2 pitch. First baseman Justin Morneau flied out, leaving him hitless in five at-bats and two points behind Josh Harrison (.319) in the National League batting race.After right fielder Michael Cuddyer flied out, Rosario connected, giving the Rockies their third straight win and fourth in five games on their final seven-game homestand.Rockies reliever LaTroy Hawkins (4-3) retired the side in order in the top of the ninth and was the winning pitcher.The Rockies got a strong but abbreviated start from Yohan Flande. In his first start since Aug. 17, Flande, who made four scoreless relief appearances this month totaling 4 1/3 innings, was on a limit of 60-65 pitches and left after throwing 59 pitches and giving up two hits and two runs in five innings."He looked a lot like he has for five innings in just about every start," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of Flande, who left with the Rockies trailing 2-1.Diamondbacks starter Vidal Nuno gave up three runs and left after throwing 98 pitches, 74 strikes, in 5 1/3 innings. He remains winless in 13 starts for the Arizona since being acquired from the New York Yankees in a July trade.A four-run sixth gave the Diamondbacks a 6-1 lead, the final two runs scoring on a single by Jordan Pacheco, who Arizona claimed off waivers from the Rockies in early June.Tommy Kahnle, who took over for Flande in the sixth, forced in a run with a walk after loading the bases with no outs. Kahnle sandwiched a walk between singles by Ender Inciarte and center fielder A.J. Pollock, leaving after throwing just five of 15 pitches for strikes.Matt Belisle relieved Kahnle and gave up a sacrifice fly to right fielder Cody Ross that moved up all three runners in addition to making the score 4-1. Belisle fell behind catcher Miguel Montero 2-1 and intentionally walked him to get to Pacheco.Cuddyer, who homered in the second and went 3-for-5 with a double, one RBI and three runs scored, led off the Rockies' eighth with a double and scored to make it 6-4 on Rosario's single. Zeke Spruill got left fielder Bandon Barnes to ground into a double play but gave up an infield single to third baseman Charlie Culberson followed by DJ LeMahieu's double that made it a one-run game, setting the stage for Rosario."In that situation, you only have one notion," said Rosario, who is hitting .265 with 51 RBIs. "Try to hit the ball hard and see what happens. I hit it real good. I got the opportunity to find that pitch up in the zone, and I do my thing."NOTES: Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado returned to Coors Field for the first time since Monday, when he was diagnosed with early onset pneumonia. He might not play again this season. ... Diamondbacks RHP Daniel Hudson will not pitch the rest of the season, but he is not being shut down for health reasons.

Diamondbacks RF Daniel Peralta, who has not played since Sept. 5 due to a lower back strain, is a day or two away from returning. ...

He is 6-4 for the Giants after going 1-9 with Boston while receiving limited run support earlier this season."Every start, he's been right on, and we needed it tonight," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's been a pleasure to watch. You just have to love how he competes out there."The Giants (83-68) broke a three-game losing streak and closed to within three games of the Dodgers in the NL West. They have a 2 1/2-game lead over Pittsburgh and a four-game lead over Milwaukee for the NL wild-card spots.Santiago Casilla pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 16th save in 20 attempts.Right fielder Hunter Pence and first baseman Travis Ishikawa opened the seventh inning with singles off Arizona right-hander Josh Collmenter (10-8) before Crawford's sacrifice fly broke a 1-1 tie.Crawford has a career-high 63 RBIs.Second baseman Chris Owings tripled and center fielder A.J. Pollock singled to tie the game at 1-1 in the sixth inning for the Diamondbacks (62-89), who had a three-game winning streak broken. They have not won four in a row this season.Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval had two hits and is hitting .348 in 198 at-bats at Chase Field.Posey went 2-for-4 against Collmenter and is hitting .611 with three homers against Collmenter in his career."Who knows?" Posey said regarding his success against Collmenter. "It's just one of those baseball oddities, I guess."Collmenter gave up two runs and seven hits in eight innings to lower his ERA to 3.60, the lowest it has been since a three-hit shutout against Cincinnati on May 29. He has given up four earned runs in last five starts."The one pitch to Posey, if he hits that out I will give him credit," Collmenter said. "It was a good pitch. Maybe the ball looks like a beach ball to him. I am not sure. Up and down, soft and hard, it doesn't matter, he seems to get the bat on it."Posey's homer in the fourth inning was his 21st, three short of his career high set in 2012. He had 15 last season.Peavy gave up a leadoff single to Arizona left fielder Ender Inciarte in the first inning but did not give up another hit until first baseman Mark Trumbo looped a double into short center field in the fourth inning.Trumbo was the only runner the D-backs had in scoring position until they scored in the sixth."His command has been great," Posey said of Peavy. "We've had a good rhythm."NOTES: Giants CF Angel Pagan missed his second consecutive start because of back stiffness. He has a bulging disk that could require offseason surgery, but he remains day-to-day, manager Bruce Bochy said. ... Arizona LHP Andrew Chafin will make his second major league start Wednesday, manager Kirk Gibson said. Chafin will replace RHP Randall Delgado in the six-man rotation, and Delgado will return to the bullpen. ... Arizona RHP Chase Anderson (9-6, 3.70 ERA) will be shut down after his final start of the season Friday in Colorado, according to Gibson. Anderson leads NL rookies in victories. ... San Francisco RHP Tim Lincecum and Arizona RHP Josh Collmenter are the only pitchers in the majors with at least 10 victories, one save and 150 innings.Distributed by Internet Broadcasting and The Sports Xchange.

He could not have placed it better."I have to wear that area out," said Trumbo, a right-handed hitter, "and if they do come inside, it should be a reaction. If I do get pull happy, my swing goes in the garbage can."Trumbo's third-inning grand slam, which snapped a career-worst, 120-at-bat home run drought, broke a scoreless tie and sent the Diamondbacks to a 6-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Chase Field.Trumbo, who finished the night with five RBIs, has nine homers and 49 RBIs this year after missing 11 weeks with a stress fracture in his left foot. He had 29, 32 and 34 homers in his previous three seasons with the Los Angeles Angels."I don't necessarily hit long home runs, but lately I've been trying to hit the ball in the air more," Trumbo said. "There is not a ton of money on the ground for me, figuratively. I don't have the speed to beat those balls out. I'm a guy who needs to set my sights a little higher and try to shoot those gaps. If they do go out of the park, all the better."Left-hander Wade Miley (8-11) beat the Giants for the third time this season as the Diamondbacks (62-88) won a third consecutive game for the first time since the first three games after the All-Star break.First baseman Joaquin Arias had three hits and a run, and second baseman Joe Panik had two hits and a run for the Giants (82-68), who lost their third straight.

"You take a way that pitch, and it is a pretty good outing. But that pitch counts, unfortunately."Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock hit an RBI triple in the seventh inning and scored twice.Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval had two hits, and catcher Buster Posey singled in the final run in the eighth inning. The Giants led the NL in runs per game since the All-Star break coming in."You are still confident the way we have been scoring that we are going to come back, but we faced a good pitcher," Bochy said. "Miley has had a lot of games like this, and he threw well tonight."Miley (8-11) allowed seven hits and one run in seven innings. He is 3-1 with a 3.13 ERA in four starts against the Giants this season. He gave up nine baserunners in two innings in his last start, taking the loss against San Francisco on Sept. 9."He was great, considering his last start was against these guys and it didn't go well at all," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "He had the extra day to think about it, and he put some work in and he slowed down today. His changeup was really good."Vogelsong pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings in a no-decision against Arizona on Wednesday, but he couldn't match that performance Monday."It was a cutter that didn't do anything," Vogelsong said of the 0-1 pitch that Trumbo hit out.

"You worry about the next team when they come in. That was our approach."Right-hander Jake Peavy continued a stretch of brilliant pitching by Giants starters, holding the Diamondbacks to one run in 5 2/3 innings.Right-handers Yusmeiro Petit, Ryan Vogelsong and Peavy combined to limit the Diamondbacks to two runs and 12 hits in 21 1/3 innings in the series sweep, the Giants' first over the Diamondbacks at home since 2011."This was a game we wanted and we came out and played a good game all the way around," Peavy observed. "A good way to go into the weekend, that's for sure."In winning a third consecutive start, Peavy (5-4) allowed six hits, including a triple by shortstop Cliff Pennington and double by first baseman Mark Trumbo that produced the Diamondbacks' first run in the sixth inning. Right-hander Jean Machi relieved Peavy with two outs and Trumbo at second and got center fielder A.J. Pollock to ground to second.Peavy struck out eight, one off his season best, and did not walk a batter in 5 2/3 innings."Since we've gotten him, it's been fun to watch him. He's been on every start," Bochy said of Peavy. "He did another great job."Giants catcher Buster Posey led a 12-hit attack with a double and two singles, right fielder Hunter Pence drove in two runs and center fielder Angel Pagan scored twice after two hits.The Giants have outscored their opponents 58-14 during their home winning streak."We're feeling good right now," Posey assured. "The way we came out and played these three games, you could tell everybody was focused on the Diamondbacks."The Giants got to Arizona starter Randall Delgado for single runs in the first, third and fourth innings to take a 3-0 lead. Pagan scored the first two runs after leading off the first and third innings with a double and a single, respectively.Delgado (3-4), who entered the game with a 2.00 career ERA against the Giants in seven previous appearances, was pulled after having allowed three runs and seven hits in four innings. He walked two and struck out three."If you're not hitting, you have to play better, and we didn't do that," analyzed Diamondbacks center fielder A.J. Pollock, whose team fell into a tie with Colorado for last place in the N.L. West."They had a couple of hits I'm still scratching my head how they got. But they are believing it right now and have a lot of positive vibes going."Interestingly, the early hook on Delgado allowed Diamondbacks starters to post a 14th consecutive game allowing three or fewer runs. The streak is the longest in a season in Arizona history.The Giants broke the game open with a three-run sixth inning against the third Diamondbacks pitcher, right-hander Matt Stites. Left fielder Juan Perez, who entered the game in a double switch in the top of the inning, doubled in a run and scored on Posey's third hit -- a single -- to highlight the uprising.With a comfortable lead, the Giants were able to pull two starters to give them an extra inning or two of rest before the big series."It should be exciting baseball," Bochy predicted. "We're playing a very, very good team. It's what the game's all about. It's where you hope to be in September."Diamondbacks third baseman Jake Lamb capped the game's scoring with a solo home run, his third homer of the season, off Giants right-hander Santiago Casilla in the ninth inning.Pennington and second baseman Chris Owings had two hits apiece for Arizona, which was outhit 12-9.NOTES: Giants starting pitchers have posted a 1.00 ERA in their last 10 home games. ... Giants CF Angel Pagan went 7-for-12 in the series to raise his average against the Diamondbacks to .488 this season. ... The Giants got good news during the game when 1B Brandon Belt was formally cleared to resume full-scale baseball activities. Giants manager Bruce Bochy expects Belt, out since Aug. 6 with a concussion, to be back in the lineup before the end of the regular season. ... Bochy listed OF/1B Michael Morse (strained left oblique) as doubtful for the three-game series against the Los Angeles Dodgers that begins Friday night. ...

No. 1 starter Patrick Corbin and setup man David Hernandez will miss the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery a week apart during spring training, and starting outfielders Mark Trumbo and A.J. Pollock will miss at least two months because of injuries.Arroyo, 37, said an MRI on June 16 showed a complete tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, but that he hoped rest would allow him to get back on the mound by his self-imposed July 15 deadline."I was going to see if I could ride it without the ligament," Arroyo said. "If this was the last year of my career, I could gut through it with anti-inflammatories and different things and it would be tough. But if I want to play after this year, it's going to be impossible."Arroyo, who was 7-4 with a 4.08 in 14 starts, said he believed the ligament was completely torn during a complete-game 3-1 victory over Washington on May 13, but he continued to pitch on it until the discomfort became too great. He was 3-2 with a 3.99 ERA in six starts while pitching with the complete tear.The durable Arroyo had averaged 13 victories and 207 innings per season from 2004-2013, and he had made 33 consecutive starts until coming out of the rotation because of elbow soreness after a June 15 start in Los Angeles, a 6-3 victory."I thought maybe I'd retire at 39 or 40, but who knows, I might pitch much further if I do come back healthy, because it's a lot of extra work I'm having to do to try to come back now," Arroyo said. "I think my body's a lot younger than my age is. I think I'm probably closer to 32-33 as far as the way I feel in comparison to most guys my age. So I don't think it's going to be a problem coming back."Tommy John surgery typically requires a 12-month rehab period.Arroyo is in the first year of a $23.5 million contract that is to pay him $9.5 million in 2014 and 2015 with an $11 million option that includes a $4.5 million buyout for 2016. That option increases to $13 million if he is traded during the course of the contract.He hopes to make a half-seasons's worth of starts in 2015 to give the D-backs a long look before his option becomes due."I don't want to put this organization in a position where I only pitch maybe two starts in September of next year and then they're not really sure if they want to pick up that option, because it's a pretty hefty option," Arroyo said.

Both men have stated they opinions far apart on the issue of where the market should be."For me it will be a very big minus,” said Belov.  “If they open these markets here it will destroy these days, Saturday and Sunday."According to Belov, the clientele visiting the market have been different than the customers who frequent his store and others along the strip.  He expressed worries that the presence of the market will add to the congestion along 4th Avenue."People who are coming here, they're not coming for the shopping,” said Belov. “They don't help our businesses - maybe they help sell hot dogs."The ACDA board will meet either August 1st or August 8th to discuss the Anchorage Downtown Market’s future.Contact Adam PinskerCopyright © 2013, KTUU-TVNo email address was supplied by.
